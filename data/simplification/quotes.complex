also, in the unlikely event that amazon.com, inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

we may modify or revise these terms of service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these terms of service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at http://www.thumbzilla.com/information#terms, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. if we change anything in these terms of service, the change will be reflected in the “last modified date”. you agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. you agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms. if the “last modified” date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. on the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones. all changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the website thereafter. the updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. if you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. you are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. by continuing to use the website subsequent to us making available an amended version of these terms of service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment. 
we have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these terms of service.

(re-users may comply with either license or both.) the only exception is if the project edition or feature requires a different license. in that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license.
 you are responsible for your own actions: you are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on wikimedia projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. for clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the united states of america. although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. wmf generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.
if you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in san francisco county, california. you also agree that the laws of the state of california and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the united states of america will govern these terms of use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in san francisco county, california, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these terms of use.  
we believe that community input is essential for these terms of use to properly serve our users
however, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it.
because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the united states of america or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities.
we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. 
we provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis
these terms of use went into effect on june 16, 2014.
though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the projects, you can stop using our services any time. 
because we believe that you shouldn’t have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:   read, edit, or use any wikimedia site without registering an account.
register for an account without providing an email address or real name.
in the interests of our users and the projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same project, unless we provide explicit permission.
we actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. these generally include tracking pixels, javascript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage.
this version was approved by katherine maher on may 17, 2018, pursuant to the delegation of policy-making authority by the board, and went into effect on may 24, 2018. 
please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of wikimedia content under the laws of the united states of america and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content).
changes to this privacy policy substantial changes to this policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.
to ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these terms of use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).
if in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these terms of use, it is not a waiver of that provision.
if any provision or part of a provision of these terms of use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these terms of use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these terms of use will remain in full force and effect.
be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.
we make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements,
this is a human-readable summary of the terms of use.
in certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the wikimedia community or its members (as described in section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these terms of use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user.
any content you add or any change that you make to a wikimedia site will be publicly and permanently available.
This is a disadvantage and terrible idea for users who added information they did not realize they should not have added to the site. This is especially a detriment for any minors (users under the age of 21) who use the service, whenever they add content which could affect them or hurt them.
please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this policy, which we may update from time to time. if we modify the policy, we will make it available through the service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. your continued use of the service after the revised policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the policy. 
4.4 law enforcement, legal process and compliance we may disclose personal data or other information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. we also reserve the right to disclose personal data or other information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the service and any facilities or equipment used to make the service available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others.

from time to time, we may contract with third-party marketing partners and advertising networks that use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your visits to and actions on certain pages of our site and about whether you open certain emails we send you. we do this in order to serve advertisements for relevant plex products and services to you later, such as when you are on certain third-party sites, and to measure the performance of our messages.
again, like many online services, plex and its third party partners (such as facebook, google and amazon) employ a technology known as “tracking pixels.” a pixel is a small one-pixel-by-one-pixel clear image that is embedded in html content, and is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence. when html content containing a pixel is rendered, the pixel transmits anonymous, non-personally identifiable information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or ip address.
for example, we may place a pixel in html-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or on a webpage to count the number of unique visitors to that page.

History
This is not a long Terms of Service page. It is short, neatly sectioned, readable in plain English, and uses bullet points for each part of the ToS policy.
Initial report (pre-March 2020 version of the site):  Once an eSix account has been made, it cannot be deleted. Both regular users and the administration recommends that users change their account's usernames, passwords, and email address to completely random ones to make it harder for their account to be accessed again. However, accounts maintain their ID numbers (shown in the URL) and all of the account's undeleted posts, deleted post history, tag edits, wiki edits, unhidden comments, et cetera will remain visible to all users.  Update: As of March 2020, the site has been revamped with a new backend software and now allows users to delete their accounts. This feature was first added in a 2019 beta version of the new site (see new source) and has been kept in the current version.
copyright infringement if you believe a post infringes upon your copyright, please follow the instructions located on the takedown page.
if you are an artist, character owner, or commissioner who has your work hosted on this site and you do not wish for it to be, please submit a takedown request. the request will be handled as soon as possible.
we strive to make sure that this site has a wide variety of content for users to enjoy, but we also place great importance on ensuring that the content we host does not infringe upon artists' or character owners' copyrights. in addition to that we also respect the commissioner' wishes on art they have paid for.</p

p> major religions, religious figures, political parties, or political figures  suggested suspension length: 3 days this category includes:  any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major religions or religious figures any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major political parties or political figures   the main point behind this is, while we do encourage free speech and we have no problem with someone saying “thank god” or “jesus blesses you”, we have to draw the line at an actual discussion, as it often leads to passionate and heated debate and a general distraction from what is ultimately a furry art archive. the same goes for politics, we know that people want to talk about it, and often do, but there are places for that and they are not here. </p

major religions, religious figures, political parties, or political figuressuggested suspension length: 3 daysthis category includes:  any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major religions or religious figures any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major political parties or political figures  the main point behind this is, while we do encourage free speech and we have no problem with someone saying “thank god” or “jesus blesses you”, we have to draw the line at an actual discussion, as it often leads to passionate and heated debate and a general distraction from what is ultimately a furry art archive. the same goes for politics, we know that people want to talk about it, and often do, but there are places for that and they are not here.
