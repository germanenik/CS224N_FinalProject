we believe that you shouldn' t have to provide nonpublic personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement .<q>after all, it' s people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the wikimedia sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive .<q>## ## definitions back to top [! [wwc arrow up . png] (/ / upload . wikimedia . org / wikipedia / commons / c / ce / wwc _ arrow _ up . png) ] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy #top " privacy policy #top ") we recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like “ tracking pixels ” and “ cookies ” used in the privacy policy .
" personal information " | information you provide us or information we collect from you in the context of your use of the wikimedia sites that could be used to personally identify you .<q>" contributions " | content you add or changes you make to any wikimedia sites .<q>this includes other wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the wikimedia movement such as [wikimedia chapters] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / wikimedia _ chapters " m: wikimedia chapters "), [thematic organizations] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / wikimedia _ thematic _ organizations " m: wikimedia thematic organizations "), and [user groups] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / wikimedia _ user _ groups " m: wikimedia user groups ") as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, [grant recipients] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / grants: table " m: grants: table "), and contractors of those organizations or groups .
this policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties .<q>to understand more about what this privacy policy covers, please see below .<q>this privacy policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information .
if a wikimedia foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy .<q>this separate policy will also be made available where the extension can be downloaded .<q>volunteers that have such access include: * * * administrative volunteers * *, such as [checkusers] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / special: mylanguage / checkuser " m: special: mylanguage / checkuser ") or [stewards] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / special: mylanguage / stewards " m: special: mylanguage / stewards ").
third parties this privacy policy only covers the way the wikimedia foundation collects, uses and discloses personal information and does not address the practices of third parties .<q>we support platforms for third - party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as [wmflabs . org] (https: / / www . mediawiki . org / wiki / wikimedia _ cloud _ services).<q>we provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other .
if you come across such a third - party tool, and you believe it violates this policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy [at] wikimedia . org so we can investigate .<q>sometimes, volunteers may place a data - collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a wikimedia site without our knowledge .<q>however, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this policy .
if you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address .<q>please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions .<q>if you want to create a [standard account] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / faq #standardaccount " privacy policy / faq "), in most cases we require only a username and a password .
no other personal information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card information .<q>we will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information .<q>once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to).
for example, if you want to upload a photo on the wikimedia commons mobile app, we may receive [metadata] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / glossary _ of _ key _ terms #metadata " privacy policy / glossary of key terms "), such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device .<q>please be aware that, unlike location information collected using gps signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the wikimedia sites .
we also use a variety of commonly - used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the wikimedia sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you .<q>for this reason, we keep information related to your use of the wikimedia sites confidential, except as provided in this policy .<q>we also want this policy and our practices to reflect our community' s values .
these generally include [tracking pixels] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / glossary _ of _ key _ terms #tracking _ pixel " privacy policy / glossary of key terms "), [javascript] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / glossary _ of _ key _ terms #javascript " privacy policy / glossary of key terms "), and a variety of " locally stored data " technologies, such as [cookies] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / glossary _ of _ key _ terms #cookies " privacy policy / glossary of key terms ") and [local storage] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / glossary _ of _ key _ terms #local _ storage " privacy policy / glossary of key terms ").<q>we use this information to make your experience with the wikimedia sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the wikimedia sites, and to generally improve our services .<q>so we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them .
* deliver more relevant content to you faster .<q>also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you .<q>we believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser .
while the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through [public logs] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / faq #publiclogsfaq " privacy policy / faq ") alongside actions taken by other users .<q>for example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a wikimedia site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a wikimedia site .<q>we will customize the services, in some instances, at your direction; in all instances, in keeping with our legitimate charitable purpose of pursuing our mission .
you can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your notifications preferences .<q>we will send these types of emails to you only with your consent .<q>we do not sell, rent, or use your email address to advertise third - party products or services to you .
for example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location .<q>for example, if you upload a photo using the wikimedia commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload .<q>if you are visiting wikimedia sites with your mobile device, we may use your ip address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas .
we also use personal information in the manner described in the sections of this policy titled " for legal reasons " and " to protect you, ourselves & others . " back to top [!

in the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), we will continue to keep your personal information confidential, except as provided in this policy, and provide notice to you via the wikimedia sites and a notification on [wikimediaannounce - l] (https: / / lists . wikimedia . org / mailman / listinfo / wikimediaannounce - l) or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy .<q>however, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address .<q>nothing in this privacy policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party' s request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information .
we, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, may need to share your personal information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our [terms of use] (/ wiki / terms _ of _ use " terms of use "), this privacy policy, or any wikimedia foundation or user community - based policies .<q>we may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions .<q>these rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users .
so sometimes we use third - party service providers or contractors who help run or improve the wikimedia sites for you and other users .<q>as hard as we may try, we can' t do it all .<q>we put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this policy .
when we give access to personal information to third - party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this policy and in accordance with our instructions .<q>sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns .<q>they then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the wikimedia sites .
we strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure .<q>we use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your personal information .<q>unfortunately, there' s no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can' t guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).
if you decide to use wikimedia sites, whether from inside or outside of the u . s ., you understand that your personal information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the u . s .<q>for further information about how you may request access to or deletion of your personal information, or other rights you may have with respect to your personal information, see our [faq] (/ wiki / privacy _ policy / faq #anonymize " privacy policy / faq ").<q>to learn more about our data retention practices, see our [data retention guidelines] (https: / / meta . wikimedia . org / wiki / data _ retention _ guidelines).
we do not share your data with third parties for marketing purposes .<q>under this policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the “ when may we share your information ” section of this privacy policy .<q>we reserve the right to do so in the following manner: * in the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days .
we ask that you please review the most up - to - date version of our privacy policy .<q>prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the wikimedia sites, and via a notification on [wikimediaannounce - l] (https: / / lists . wikimedia . org / mailman / listinfo / wikimediaannounce - l) or a similar mailing list .<q>your continued use of the wikimedia sites after this privacy policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this privacy policy on your part .
