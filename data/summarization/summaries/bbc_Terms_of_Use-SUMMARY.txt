these apply to our services and content .<q>the rules [about shareables] (/ usingthebbc / terms / #sharing - commenting - voting - and - submissions " shareables - what they are ") are here .<q>one exception is content that' s made to be shared - " shareables " for short - which has some different, more relaxed rules .

provided: * you don' t change the feed or remove any of our branding or logos * you credit us by saying it' s from [bbc news] (http: / / www . bbc . co . uk / news " bbc news "), [bbc . co . uk / news] (http: / / www . bbc . co . uk / news " bbc news ") or [bbc . com / news] (http: / / www . bbc . com / news " bbc news ") putting the text and hyperlink in a prominent place nearby * you don' t add our branding, logos and so on, except for any branding that' s already embedded in the feed .<q>for people * * you' re not allowed to pluck metadata from our content or feeds .<q>you can add the bbc news feed to your website or social media account .
