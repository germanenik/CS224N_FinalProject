practices regarding the data we collect from and about users of [our
website](/), (the " **site "**) and our downloadable desktop and mobile
applications (together with the site and any other products and services
provided by parsec, the " **services** "). [CLS] [SEP]

will post a notice on the website prior to such changes taking effect. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] ## a note about children. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not intentionally gather personal information from individuals who are

[CLS] [SEP] for example, if you connect to the service through your discord account, we may collect information about the games you purchase or play, and information about how you interact with content on discord.

information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through
our service. [CLS] [SEP]

### user generated content. [CLS] [SEP]

we may make available on our website, or link to, features that allow you to
generate your own content or share information online (e.g., in chat areas). [CLS] [SEP]
please do not embed personal information in the content you generate or share
personal information online in public or in community forums, because any such
information can be collected and used by others. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] ## cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. [CLS] [SEP] "cookies"
are small pieces of information that a website stores to your computer or
mobile device while you access the website. [CLS] [SEP] we may use both session cookies
(which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which
stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
personal and interactive experience on our website. [CLS] [SEP] this type of information
is collected to make the website more useful to you and to tailor the
experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. [CLS] [SEP] we use the
following types of cookies:

    *  **essential cookies -** these cookies are essential to provide you with the services and to enable you to use some of its features. [CLS] [SEP] for example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided. [CLS] [SEP]
    *  **functionality cookies -** these cookies allow the services to remember choices you make when you use the services, such as login details and progress within a course. [CLS] [SEP] the purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the services. [CLS] [SEP]
    *  **analytics and performance cookies -** these cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the services and how they are used. [CLS] [SEP] the information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, and is aggregated and anonymized. [CLS] [SEP] it includes information like the number of visitors to our website, referring websites, pages viewed on our website, what time of day they visited our website, and whether they have visited our website before. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to help operate our website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our website. [CLS] [SEP] we use google analytics, and facebook for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more information about how to opt out of tracking technologies in our [online tracking opt-out guide](/privacy#13-online-tracking-opt-out-guide) below. [CLS] [SEP]
    *  **social media cookies -** these cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on the services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as facebook, twitter or instagram. [CLS] [SEP] the social network will record that you have done this. [CLS] [SEP]
    *  **pixel tag.** in addition, we use **" pixel tags"** (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). [CLS] [SEP] pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of web users. [CLS] [SEP] in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. [CLS] [SEP] pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. [CLS] [SEP] we do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our usersâ personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
    *  **do not track signals.** some internet browsers may be configured to send "do not track" signals to the online services that you visit. [CLS] [SEP] we currently do not respond to do not track signals. [CLS] [SEP] to find out more about "do not track," please visit <https://allaboutdnt.com/>. [CLS] [SEP]

the ccpa grants individuals whose information is governed by the ccpa the
following rights:

      *  **information.** you can request information about how we have collected, used and shared and used your personal information during the past 12 months. [CLS] [SEP] we have made this this information available to california residents without having to request it by including it in the above chart. [CLS] [SEP]
      *  **access.** you can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you. [CLS] [SEP]
      *  **deletion.** you can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that the ccpa limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us
from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request
and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion
request. [CLS] [SEP] if we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you. [CLS] [SEP]

you are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from
discrimination. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### how to submit a request. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ddb1b8babcb19dadbcafaeb8bef3bcadad)

 **identity verification.** the ccpa requires us to verify the identity of the
individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information
before providing a substantive response to the request. [CLS] [SEP]

 **authorized agents.** california residents can empower an "authorized agent"
to submit requests on their behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we will require the authorized agent to
have a written authorization confirming that authority. [CLS] [SEP]

 **online tracking opt-out guide**

like many companies online, we may use services provided by google, facebook
and other companies that use tracking technology. [CLS] [SEP] these services rely on
tracking technologies â such as cookies and web beacons â to collect
directly from your device information about your browsing activities, your
interactions with websites, and the device you are using to connect to the
internet. [CLS] [SEP] there are a number of ways to opt out of having your online activity
and device data collected through these services, which we have summarized
below:

      *  **blocking cookies in your browser.** most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. [CLS] [SEP] to do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we use google analytics for analytics purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more information about google analytics cookies [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) and about how google protects your data [here](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/). [CLS] [SEP] you can prevent the use of google analytics relating to your use of our website by downloading and installing a browser plugin available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-gb). [CLS] [SEP]
      *  **blocking advertising id use in your mobile settings.** your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising id associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
      *  **using privacy plug-ins or browsers.** you can block our websites from setting cookies used for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like [brave](https://brave.com/), or installing browser plugins like [privacy badger](https://privacybadger.org/), [ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) or [ublock origin](https://ublock.org/), and configuring them to block third-party cookies/trackers. [CLS] [SEP]
      *  **platform opt-outs.** the following advertising partners offer opt-out features that let you opt-out of use of your information for interest-based advertising:
        * google: <https://adssettings.google.com>
        * facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/>
      * **advertising industry opt-out tools.** you can also use these opt-out options to limit use of your information for interest-based advertising by participating companies:
        * digital advertising alliance: <http://optout.aboutads.info>
        * network advertising initiative: <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/>

note that because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or
browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt-out on every browser
and device that you use. [CLS] [SEP]
