# twitter privacy policy

we believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use
it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. [CLS] [SEP] we want to empower
you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
thatâs the basic purpose of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

goglobalwithtwitterbanner

you should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you
take away from it:

twitter is public and tweets are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone
around the world. [CLS] [SEP] we give you non-public ways to communicate on twitter too,
through protected tweets and direct messages. [CLS] [SEP] you can also use twitter under a
pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name. [CLS] [SEP]

when you use twitter, even if youâre just looking at tweets, we receive some
personal information from you like the type of device youâre using and your
ip address. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose to share additional information with us like your
email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile. [CLS] [SEP] we
use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing
you more relevant tweets, people to follow, events, and ads. [CLS] [SEP]

we give you control through your
[settings](https://twitter.com/settings/account) to limit the data we collect
from you and how we use it, and to control things like account security,
marketing preferences, apps that can access your account, and address book
contacts youâve uploaded to twitter. [CLS] [SEP] you can alsoâ
[download](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-
your-twitter-archive)â information you have shared on twitter.â

in addition to information you share with us, we use your tweets, content
youâve read, liked, or retweeted, and other information to determine what
topics youâre interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other
signals to show you more relevant content. [CLS] [SEP] we give you
[transparency](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data) into that
information, and you can modify or correct it at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your
personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to
hear from you. [CLS] [SEP] you can [contact us](https://help.twitter.com/forms/privacy) at
any time. [CLS] [SEP]

##  information you share with us

**we require certain information to provide our services to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
you must have an account in order to upload or share content on twitter. [CLS] [SEP] when
you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to
operate our services.**

1.1

## basic account information

you donât have to create an account to use some of our service features,
such as searching and viewing public twitter profiles or watching a broadcast
on periscopeâs website. [CLS] [SEP] if you do choose to create an account, you must
provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. [CLS] [SEP]
on twitter this includes a display name (for example, âtwitter momentsâ),
a username (for example, @twittermoments), a password, and an email address or
phone number. [CLS] [SEP] your display name and username are always public, but you can
use either your real name or a pseudonym. [CLS] [SEP] you can also create and manage
multiple twitter accounts1, for example to express different parts of your
identity. [CLS] [SEP]

1.2

## public information

most activity on twitter is public, including your profile information2, [your
time zone and language](https://twitter.com/settings/account), when you
created your account, and your tweets and certain information about your
tweets like the date, time, and application and version of twitter you tweeted
from. [CLS] [SEP] you also may choose to publish your location in your tweets or your
twitter profile. [CLS] [SEP] the lists you create, people you follow and who follow you,
and tweets you like or retweet are also public. [CLS] [SEP] if you like, retweet, reply,
or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might
thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you
engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. [CLS] [SEP]
periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on
periscope or on twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. [CLS] [SEP] so
are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts youâve received, which
accounts you are a superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on
replay. [CLS] [SEP] any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another
accountâs broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it
remains on periscope. [CLS] [SEP] information posted about you by other people who use our
services may also be public. [CLS] [SEP] for example, other people may tag you in a photo3
(if your settings allow) or mention you in a tweet. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for your tweets and other information you provide through
our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public,
especially if it is sensitive information. [CLS] [SEP] if you update your public
information on twitter, such as by deleting a tweet or deactivating your
account, we will reflect your updated content on twitter.com, twitter for ios,
and twitter for android. [CLS] [SEP]

by publicly posting content when you tweet, you are directing us to disclose
that information as broadly as possible, including through our apis, and
directing those accessing the information through our apis to do the same. [CLS] [SEP] to
facilitate the fast global dissemination of tweets to people around the world,
[we use technology like application programming
interfaces](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-api)â
([apis](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-api)) and embeds
to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use
- for example, displaying tweets on a news website or analyzing what people
say on twitter. [CLS] [SEP] we generally make this content available in limited quantities
for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. [CLS] [SEP] we have [standard
terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms) that govern how this
data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. [CLS] [SEP] but these
individuals and companies are not affiliated with twitter, and their offerings
may not reflect updates you make on twitter. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about how we
make public data on twitter available to the world, visit

1.3

## contact information and address books

we use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number,
to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to
help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. [CLS] [SEP] we also use contact information to enable
certain account features (for example, for[ login
verification](https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account/two-factor-
authentication) or [twitter via sms](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-
twitter/create-twitter-account-mobile#)), and to send you information about
our services, and to personalize our services, including ads. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide
us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from twitter to
that number as your countryâs laws allow. [CLS] [SEP] twitter also uses your contact
information to market to you as your countryâs laws allow, and to help
others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-
party services and client applications. [CLS] [SEP] you can use your settings for
[email](https://twitter.com/settings/notifications) and [mobile
notifications](https://twitter.com/settings/devices) to control notifications
you receive from twitter. [CLS] [SEP] you can also unsubscribe from a notification by
following the instructions contained within the notification or
[here](https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account#notifications). [CLS] [SEP]

you can choose to upload and sync your address book on twitter so that we can
help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and
connect with you. [CLS] [SEP] we also use this information to better recommend content to
you and others. [CLS] [SEP]

you can sign up for periscope with an account from another service like
twitter, google, or facebook, or connect your periscope account to these other
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you do, we will use information from that service, including your
email address, friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or
content to you or to recommend your account or content to others. [CLS] [SEP] you can
control whether your periscope account is discoverable by email through your
[periscope settings](https://pscp.tv/account/settings). [CLS] [SEP]

if you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address,
and your contact information to respond to your request. [CLS] [SEP]



1.4

## direct messages and non-public communications

we provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control
who sees your content. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can use [direct
messages](https://help.twitter.com/using-twitter/direct-messages) to have non-
public conversations on twitter, [protect your
tweets](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-
tweets), or host [private
broadcasts](https://help.pscp.tv/customer/portal/articles/2017789) on
periscope. [CLS] [SEP] when you communicate with others by sending or receiving direct
messages, we will store and process your communications and information
related to them. [CLS] [SEP] this includes link scanning for malicious content, link
shortening to [http://t.co](http://t.co/) urls, detection of spam4, abuse and
prohibited images, and use of reported issues. [CLS] [SEP] we also use information about
whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those
communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the
safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. [CLS] [SEP] we
share the content of your direct messages with the people youâve sent them
to; we do not use them to serve you ads. [CLS] [SEP] note that if you interact in a way
that would ordinarily be public with twitter content shared with you via
direct message, for instance by liking a tweet, those interactions will be
public. [CLS] [SEP] when you use features like direct messages to communicate, remember
that recipients have their own copy5â of your communications on twitter - even
if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may
duplicate, store, or re-share. [CLS] [SEP]

# basic location data

whenever you use twitter, twitter gets a general sense of your location from
things like the network youâre using to access the internet. [CLS] [SEP] this helps
twitter to provide you with relevant content. [CLS] [SEP]

## links

in order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links
across our services. [CLS] [SEP] this includes links in emails we send you and links in
tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP]

if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or
website operator might figure out that you came from twitter or periscope,
along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as
characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach. [CLS] [SEP] they may also
collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your ip
address. [CLS] [SEP]

## cookies

a cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile
device. [CLS] [SEP] like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect
additional website usage data and to operate our services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are not
required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at
public profiles. [CLS] [SEP] although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many
browsersâ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website
is attempting to place a cookie on your computer7. [CLS] [SEP] however, some of our
services may not function properly if you disable cookies. [CLS] [SEP] when your browser
or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to
better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate
usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as
by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including
ads, and remembering your language preferences. [CLS] [SEP] we do not support the do not

## log data

we receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our
services, which we refer to as âlog data,â even if you have not created an
account. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services,
interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a
third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes twitter
content, we may receive information about you. [CLS] [SEP] this log data includes
information such as your ip address, browser type, operating system, the
referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device
information (including device and application ids), search terms (including
those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. [CLS] [SEP] we also receive log
data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services,
including when you install another application through twitter. [CLS] [SEP] we use log
data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust
performance. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use log data to protect the security of accounts
and to determine what content is popular on our services. [CLS] [SEP] we also use this
data to improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the
effectiveness of our own marketing. [CLS] [SEP]

we use information you provide to us and data we receive, including log data
and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be
interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. [CLS] [SEP] this helps us

content such as embedded timelines or tweet buttons, we may receive log data
that includes the web page you visited. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to better
understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our
platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone
number, or username, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer
than 30 days. [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be

## advertisers and other ad partners

advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] we use the
information described in this privacy policy to help make our advertising more
relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your
devices to serve you ads on and off of twitter. [CLS] [SEP] our ad partners and affiliates
share information with us such as browser cookie ids, mobile device ids,
hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or
actions taken on a website or app. [CLS] [SEP] some of our ad partners, particularly our
advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their
website or app by integrating our advertising technology.â information shared
by ad partners and affiliates or collected by twitter from the websites and
apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information
you share with twitter and that twitter receives about you described elsewhere
in our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

twitter adheres to the digital advertising alliance self-regulatory principles
for online behavioral advertising (also referred to as âinterest-based
advertisingâ) and respects the daaâs consumer choice tool for you to opt
out of interest-based advertising at
[https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/). [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on
[categories](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-
requirements/policies-for-keyword-targeting.html#) that we consider sensitive
or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or

## other third parties and affiliates

we may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad
partners, such as others on twitter, partners who help us evaluate the safety
and quality of content on our platform, our [corporate
affiliates](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-services-and-

## personalizing based on your inferred identity

when you log into twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that
browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication,
security, and personalization. [CLS] [SEP] subject to your settings, we may also associate
your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into
twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or
devices).â when you provide other information to twitter, including an email
address, we associate that information with your twitter account. [CLS] [SEP] subject to
your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other
information about your identity, for example by associating your account with
hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address
you have provided to twitter. [CLS] [SEP] we do this to operate andâ personalize our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you visit websites with sports content on your
laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on twitter for androidâ and, if the
email address associated with your account shares components with another
email address, such as shared first name, last name, or initials, we may later
match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email
addresses containing those components. [CLS] [SEP]

## sharing you control

we share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your
direction, such as when you [authorize a third-party web client or
application](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/connect-or-
revoke-access-to-third-party-apps?lang=browser) to access your account or when
you direct us to share your feedback with a business. [CLS] [SEP] if youâve shared
information like direct messages or protected tweets with someone else who
accesses twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the
information may be shared with the third-party service. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal
data to help us offer or operate our services. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about these
partnerships in our [help center](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-
security/data-through-partnerships), and you can control whether twitter
shares your personal data in this way by using the âallow additional
information sharing with business partnersâ option in your [personalization
and data settings](https://twitter.com/personalization). [CLS] [SEP] (this setting does
not control sharing described elsewhere in our privacy policy, such as when we

security/data-through-partnerships).)â

consistent with this privacy policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
