### how we use information

information stored on runalyze.com is used to operate and administer the site. [CLS] [SEP]
the processed data is used to improve and correct the functionality of the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

## access data/server log files

the provider (or its hosting provider) collects data about every access to the
offer (so-called server log files). [CLS] [SEP] access data includes:

name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data
transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the
user's operating system, referrer url (the previously visited page), ip
address and the requesting provider. [CLS] [SEP]

the provider uses the protocol data only for statistical evaluations for the
purpose of operation, security and optimisation of the offer. [CLS] [SEP] however, the
provider reserves the right to check the log data subsequently if there is a
justified suspicion of illegal use based on concrete indications. [CLS] [SEP]

## contacting

when contacting the provider (e. [CLS] [SEP] g. [CLS] [SEP] by means of a contact form or e-mail) the
user's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the
event that follow-up questions arise. [CLS] [SEP]

## comments and posts

if users leave comments in the blog or other posts, their ip addresses are
stored. [CLS] [SEP] this is done for the security of the provider, if someone writes
illegal contents in comments and contributions (sworn, forbidden political
propaganda, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] in this case the provider can be prosecuted for the comment
or contribution and is therefore interested in the identity of the author. [CLS] [SEP]

## integration of third-party services and content

it is possible that third-party content such as videos from youtube, maps from
google maps, rss feeds or graphics from other websites may be included in this
online offer. [CLS] [SEP] this always presupposes that the providers of this content
(hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers") perceive the ip address
of the users. [CLS] [SEP] without the ip address, they would not be able to send the
content to the browser of the respective user. [CLS] [SEP] the ip address is therefore
required for the presentation of this content. [CLS] [SEP] we make every effort to use
only those contents whose respective providers use the ip address solely for
the delivery of the contents. [CLS] [SEP] however, we have no influence if the third-party
providers store the ip address for statistical purposes, for example. [CLS] [SEP] as far
as we know, we inform the users about this. [CLS] [SEP]

## matomo

this offer uses matomo (formerly piwik), an open source software for
statistical analysis of user access. [CLS] [SEP] matomo uses "cookies", which are text
files placed on the user's computer, to help the website analyze how users use
the site. [CLS] [SEP] the information generated by the cookie about the use of this offer
is stored on the server of the provider in germany. [CLS] [SEP] the ip address is made
anonymous immediately after processing and before it is stored. [CLS] [SEP] users may
refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their
browser, however, the provider points out to users that in this case they may
not be able to use the full functionality of this website. [CLS] [SEP]

## google maps

this offer uses google maps, which is operated by google inc, 1600
amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043, united states ("google"). [CLS] [SEP] when
a user visits a website that displays a map of google maps, the browser
establishes a direct connection to google's servers. [CLS] [SEP] according to google, no
personal data is collected without a click on the button. [CLS] [SEP] only with logged in
members, such data, among other things the ip address, are raised and
processed. [CLS] [SEP]

the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and
use of the data by google as well as your relevant rights and setting options
for the protection of your privacy can be seen by the users of google [terms
of use](http://www.google.com/intl/de_en/help/terms_maps.html) for google

stylized blue bird. [CLS] [SEP] with the help of the buttons it is possible to share a
post or page of this offer on twitter or to follow the provider on twitter. [CLS] [SEP]

when a user accesses a website on this website that contains such a button,
his browser establishes a direct connection to twitter's servers. [CLS] [SEP] the content
of the twitter button is transmitted directly from twitter to the user's
browser. [CLS] [SEP] the provider therefore has no influence on the amount of data twitter
collects with the help of this plugin and informs users according to their
level of knowledge. [CLS] [SEP] after this only the ip address of the user the url of the
respective web page is transmitted with the purchase of the buttons, but not
for other purposes, than the representation of the buttons, used. [CLS] [SEP]
