# brave browser privacy policy

_our company does not store any record of peopleâs browsing history. [CLS] [SEP] we
donât write any personal data to the blockchain. [CLS] [SEP] the only way a userâs
data is stored by brave is if the user has switched on rewards or sync._

read this document to understand how the brave browser uses data. [CLS] [SEP]

to learn how we use data to operate our websites, forums, and communications,
visit the [website privacy policy](/privacy/website/). [CLS] [SEP] to learn how we use
data for publishers and creators visit the [publisher privacy
policy](/privacy/publishers-creators/) on the basic attention token website. [CLS] [SEP]

in this policy âweâ, âusâ, etc. [CLS] [SEP] refers to brave software inc, while
âbraveâ refers to the browser. [CLS] [SEP]

## security & updates __

brave automatically checks with us for updates. [CLS] [SEP] this ensures that you always
have access to the latest security fixes. [CLS] [SEP] we count the number and type of
these requests when we receive them to produce aggregate statistics. [CLS] [SEP] no
particular personâs information can be identified in the statistics we
produce. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also update to the latest version [here](/download/). [CLS] [SEP]

## sync __

if you switch on sync then your bookmarks (and soon passwords and other data)
will be saved in an encrypted file on a cloud storage service, to which you
will have the only decryption key. [CLS] [SEP] the data1 are entirely inaccessible to
brave and to the cloud storage provider. [CLS] [SEP] [learn
how](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021218111-how-do-i-set-up-
sync-) to switch on sync here. [CLS] [SEP] (note that only brave version 0.59 and above
have the sync feature. [CLS] [SEP] you can update to the latest version
[here](/download/).)

## location __

if you use brave to visit a website that wants to determine your location, you
will be asked whether you want it to be allowed to know where you are. [CLS] [SEP] if you
click yes to this message, then the website will be sent an approximation of
where you are based on your ip address. [CLS] [SEP] your ip address will not be stored by
brave, but it may be stored by the website you have visited. [CLS] [SEP] see data
processing detail. [CLS] [SEP]

## brave rewards __

if you switch on brave rewards you are assigned a âwalletâ identifier by
uphold, our payments partner. [CLS] [SEP] we record this identifier on servers operated by
amazon and heroku (a salesforce company) in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] we take a range
of technical and organisational measures to safeguard any personal data
including the use of eu standard contractual clauses. [CLS] [SEP]

brave uses your wallet identifier to determine when to send you a monthly gift
of attention tokens (bat). [CLS] [SEP] you can disable this in preferences or settings. [CLS] [SEP]

> **tip:** you can quickly access settings by copying **_brave://rewards_**
> into your address bar. [CLS] [SEP] [learn how](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-
> us/sections/360003095931-rewards) brave rewards works here. [CLS] [SEP]

each time brave sends users a monthly gift of bat it makes a record of their
ip addresses that can be analysed to safeguard against fraud. [CLS] [SEP] brave checks to
see whether we are currently offering tokens to brave users. [CLS] [SEP] this request
includes the identifier of your unique rewards wallet. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing
detail. [CLS] [SEP]

even with brave rewards enabled, we never collect your browsing history or
similar information, and we canât derive this information from your
contributions to content creators and sites. [CLS] [SEP] instead, we aggregate
contributions among all brave users, and we cannot trace contributions to
individual users, or link any of your contributions together. [CLS] [SEP]

if you verify ownership of your brave rewards wallet with uphold, direct
contributions you make will be processed by uphold as part of your uphold
account. [CLS] [SEP] when you make a direct contribution, brave sends all the details of
that transaction to uphold so that they can execute the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] this is
subject to [upholdâs privacy policy](https://uphold.com/en/legal/privacy-
policy). [CLS] [SEP]

## ads __

if you switch on brave rewards we automatically enable brave ads. [CLS] [SEP] this means
you will receive ads in the form of notifications and in-browser sponsored
content, and basic attention tokens to reward you for viewing those ads. [CLS] [SEP] while
the categories of ads that you see and when you see them are inferred from
your browsing activity, the data are stored on your device and are
inaccessible to us. [CLS] [SEP] we will receive anonymized confirmations for ads that you
have viewed, but no data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as
an individual leaves the brave browser on your device. [CLS] [SEP] you can disable ads by
visiting `settings > brave rewards > ads` and turning off the ads default. [CLS] [SEP]

in the cases where we collect high-level statistics relating to web activity
data (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] what are the estimated amount of ads that can be served to
different content categories that users encounter as they browse the web) we
use proven privacy mechanisms like local differential privacy that guarantee
that no information about individual users will ever be revealed to us. [CLS] [SEP] read
more about how we achieve this with [privacy preserving product
analytics](https://brave.com/privacy-preserving-product-analytics-p3a/) and
[private advertising analytics](https://github.com/brave/brave-
browser/wiki/randomized-response-for-private-advertising-analytics). [CLS] [SEP] to read
more about brave ads and privacy have a look at our
[faq](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026361072-brave-ads-faq). [CLS] [SEP]

## brave today __

brave today is a private content feed integrated into the browser. [CLS] [SEP] while the
content is collected from a content server and the content sort order is
informed by your recent browsing activity, brave today is private and
anonymous. [CLS] [SEP]

content for the brave today feed is collected securely by your device through
a private and encrypted proxy method. [CLS] [SEP] the proxy removes ip addresses before
passing the encrypted request to the content server which sends the encrypted
reply back to the browser through the proxy. [CLS] [SEP] the feed is temporarily stored on
your device, and it is replaced upon starting or refreshing your brave today
session. [CLS] [SEP] no personal data, behavior activity or browsing history ever leaves
the brave browser on your device. [CLS] [SEP] your brave today sessions are not logged or
saved. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing detail. [CLS] [SEP]

**note:** ip addresses are only shared between the userâs browser and the
independent proxy which subsequently drops them. [CLS] [SEP] at no point does brave have
access to users' ip addresses used for content requests for brave today. [CLS] [SEP]

## brave together __

brave together is a private video conference tool that you can use to call
with your friends and colleagues. [CLS] [SEP] nothing that you say or type in the service
is logged or saved. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing detail. [CLS] [SEP]

**note:** your ip address is available to your internet provider. [CLS] [SEP] if your
internet provider requires the use of a turn server, then your ip address will
also be available to a company called 8ã8, which operates the turn server. [CLS] [SEP]
the content of your call is encrypted between your browser and the brave
server, so your audio and video stay private from intermediaries. [CLS] [SEP]

**to avoid scams:** for the avoidance of phishing attacks, note that we at
brave never contact brave browser users in a together call. [CLS] [SEP]

## brave firewall + vpn on ios __

users of brave on ios can switch on brave firewall + vpn. [CLS] [SEP] this is operated on
braveâs behalf by [guardian](https://guardianapp.com/). [CLS] [SEP] see data processing
detail. [CLS] [SEP]

## how we improve brave __

### crash reports __

when brave crashes, it creates a report that can be sent to us to help us fix
whatever caused the problem. [CLS] [SEP] this report contains technical information about
your computer system which is typically distinctive. [CLS] [SEP] we use a service called
backtrace.io to store them. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose whether to send us these reports. [CLS] [SEP]
even if you have chosen to send reports in the past, you can turn off future
reports in [settings](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360017905872-how-do-i-enable-or-disable-automatic-crash-
reporting-). [CLS] [SEP]

### privacy preserving product analytics __

the browser sends us anonymous reports to alert us to product problems and
necessary improvements. [CLS] [SEP] none of the information it reports harms your privacy. [CLS] [SEP]
the report only describes general use of the browser, such as a general range
of how many extensions are installed, a general range of how many tabs are
open, and whether features like shields, rewards, and ads are switched on. [CLS] [SEP]
[see the full list of questions here](https://github.com/brave/brave-
browser/wiki/p3a). [CLS] [SEP] these reports are stripped of metadata, and aggregated with
measurements reported by many other instances of brave. [CLS] [SEP] the data are not
personal, and cannot be combined to identify you. [CLS] [SEP] you can deactivate privacy-
preserving product analytics in settings. [CLS] [SEP]

### your feedback __

if you write feedback for brave, we will use this to improve the product. [CLS] [SEP] see
data processing detail. [CLS] [SEP]

### nightly, dev, and beta browser versions __

[nightly](/download-nightly/), [dev](/download-dev/), and [beta](/download-
beta/) versions of the brave browser are experimental previews of new brave
browser versions. [CLS] [SEP] they allow us to test new features so that we can find and
fix errors before releasing a new version of the brave browser. [CLS] [SEP] these test
versions of the browser may automatically send crash reports to brave so that
we can identify and fix problems. [CLS] [SEP] a crash report can contain personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing details. [CLS] [SEP]

**how to switch this feature off.** you can switch off âautomatically send
usage statistics and crash reports to brave softwareâ in settings. [CLS] [SEP]

> **tip:**  you can quickly access settings by copying _**brave://settings**_
> into your address bar. [CLS] [SEP]

these incomplete versions of brave represent unfinished and untested work on
future versions of brave, and their incomplete behavior may not be adequately
described by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] more information about the safety & reliability of
pre-release versions of brave can be found in our [development
documentation](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/release-channel-
descriptions). [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] data are personal if the data can single a person out (on their own or in combination with other data), without an unlikely degree of effort or expense or technological development. [CLS] [SEP] the gdpr definition of âpersonal dataâ includes any data that can indirectly contribute to singling out an individual, including unique ids codes, certain types of ip addresses, and encrypted data that one can decrypt without disproportionate effort. [CLS] [SEP] but data that are entirely impossible to access are not personal. [CLS] [SEP] â©ï¸
