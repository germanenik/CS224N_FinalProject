## privacy policy

  1. [CLS] [SEP] who we are

welcome to myspace®, a place where people come to connect, discover, and
share. [CLS] [SEP] showcasing artists and their work, myspace gives people access to a
massive digital music library. [CLS] [SEP] with roots in music and social, the platform is
built to empower all artists—from musicians and designers to writers and
photographers—helping them connect with audiences, collaborators, and partners
to achieve their goals. [CLS] [SEP] through an open design, compelling editorial features,
and analytics-based recommendations, myspace fosters a creative community of
people who connect around mutual affinity and inspiration for the purpose of
shaping, sharing, and discovering what’s next. [CLS] [SEP]

myspace services may include: (i) those offered on any myspace­branded url,
including [www.myspace.com](https://www.myspace.com) (the " **myspace
website** "); (ii) myspace messaging services ( _e.g._ , instant messaging,
private messaging, public and private group chatting, etc.); (iii) myspace
music and video services (including, without limitation, any myspace
tv­branded video service (" **myspace tv ™"**); (iv) myspace developer
services; (v) myspace mobile services; (vi) myspace advertising services; and
(vii) any other features, content, or applications offered or operated from
time to time by myspace in connection with myspace's business, including when
myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other
device (collectively, " **myspace services** "). [CLS] [SEP] the myspace services are
hosted in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] we may also transfer your data to other countries
(including countries outside of the european economic area) for processing by
staff who work for us or for one of our contractors. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] scope of this policy

this policy describes generally how we collect, use, store and share
information that we receive from users of myspace services (" **users** "). [CLS] [SEP]
this policy applies both to individuals using such services that register with
myspace and create myspace accounts and their associated profile(s) ("
**members** "), as well as individuals who use such myspace services without
registering (" **visitors** "). [CLS] [SEP]

this policy covers the activities of myspace with respect to the collection,
use, retention and disclosure of information through any of the myspace
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you follow a link on the myspace services to a third party’s
website, that third party’s privacy policy will govern its use of your
information, and you should read the third party website’s privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
however, when we transfer your personal information (defined below in section
3.1) to third parties, we require the third party to agree to use your
personal information only in ways that are consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that this policy does not limit myspace's use or sharing of
aggregated, deidentified or other anonymized information that does not
constitute personal information). [CLS] [SEP] we may use and/or share such information in
any manner not otherwise prohibited by this policy or by applicable law,
without notice or compensation to you, including freely disclosing for any
legal purpose non¬personal information to viant affiliates, advertisers,
partners, content owners, and other third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

we will continue to evaluate and update this policy as we rollout additional
services for our users, employ new technologies and otherwise adapt and
improve along with the evolving online and digital world so we recommend that
you check for changes regularly. [CLS] [SEP] we welcome your comments, as we strive to
maintain a policy that is both transparent and that improves the myspace
services. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that we provide you notice on any of the myspace services of
different or additional privacy policies or practices ( _e.g._ , at the point
of our collection), those different or additional terms shall govern such data
collection and use. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, please review myspace services' [terms of use](terms), which
governs your use of myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] the information that we collect
    1. [CLS] [SEP] information you provide to us

**personal information that you provide**

we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including personal
information, when you interact with the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in
this policy as " **personal information** ". [CLS] [SEP] this would include, without
limitation, your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street
address. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect personal information through the myspace services when you choose
to provide us with such information, for example, when you register to become
a member. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect personal information through a variety of other
methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit profile content or
otherwise interact with the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] we may aggregate certain items
of your personal information (such as your age) to create anonymized
statistical information about our user base (which we refer to as "
**aggregated information**."). [CLS] [SEP] once aggregated, the information in question
can no longer be re-attached to you, so it is no longer personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

      * **registration information**

certain features of the myspace services are only accessible by members who
have registered with myspace and created a myspace account (" **account** "). [CLS] [SEP]
in order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests
certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name,
e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, " **registration
information** "). [CLS] [SEP]

      * **profile content**

when you sign up as a member, you are required to create one or more myspace
profiles that are associated with your account (each, a " **profile** "). [CLS] [SEP]
myspace may allow you to populate your profile with certain content chosen by
you, and we may also associate additional content with your profile based on
your interactions with the myspace services, such as your video viewing and
other related activities (collectively, " **profile content** "). [CLS] [SEP] we keep a
record of such profile content. [CLS] [SEP] any profile content that myspace allows you to
submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our [terms of
use](terms) at all times. [CLS] [SEP] please note that your profile content may contain
registration information. [CLS] [SEP]

the information in your profile content is grouped into two main categories –
restricted information and public information. [CLS] [SEP]

" **restricted information** " refers to those portions of the profile content
and activity notifications associated with your profile to which you may elect
to restrict public access by changing the profile settings that myspace may
make available to you from time-to-time [here](/settings/profile) (" **profile
settings** ") or by changing other functionality specific settings on the
myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] these profile settings may permit you to create a "
**restricted profile** " by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute)
limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your profile that are
not required by myspace to be public information (as described below), certain
associated profile content, and some of the notifications that myspace
produces regarding your activities (" **activity notifications** "). [CLS] [SEP] further,
unless otherwise provided by myspace, all of your profile content and activity
notifications will still be available to the people whose profiles you allow
to connect to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**" public information"** refers to the portion of your profile content that
can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the myspace
services ( _e.g._ , myspace, other users, search engines, advertisers,
application developers, other third parties, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] any profile content that
does not otherwise constitute restricted information is considered public
information for the purposes of this policy. [CLS] [SEP] the following information is
public information that cannot be changed to restricted information:

      * full name
      * username
      * profile url
      * about me (the portion of your profile that provides a place to describe yourself)
      * profile photo
      * profile cover
      * stated location
      * gender
      * age
      * myspace ids

**public information also includes:**

      * any additional profile content associated with a " **public profile** ," which refers to any profile for which a user has set the profile's visibility status to "public" in his or her profile settings, but subject to mix privacy settings (as further defined below); 
      * activity notifications published on the myspace services from public profiles;
      * your status as a "top fan";
      * affinity information ( _e.g._ , the relative magnitude of your affinity for profiles and content); and 
      * the number of your connections in and connections out. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that the myspace services currently do not allow users to restrict
access to the items of public information described above, which can always be
viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the myspace services,
including via third party search engines. [CLS] [SEP] if that is not acceptable to you,
you should not use the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

you should be aware that the default setting for profiles of members who
indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public ( _i.e._ , public
profiles). [CLS] [SEP] the default setting for profiles of members who indicate that they
are under 18 years of age is restricted ( _i.e._ , restricted profiles), other
than for artist profiles (as defined in the [terms of use](terms)) of members
who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. [CLS] [SEP] other than with
respect to artist profiles, whose visibility status may not be changed, you
may change the visibility status of your profile from a public profile to a
restricted profile at any time by visiting [profile
settings](/settings/profile). [CLS] [SEP] please note, however, that activity
notifications that were created during the time that your profile was a public
profile shall remain public after any change to a restricted profile. [CLS] [SEP]

although access to restricted information will be limited as set forth above,
it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they
may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. [CLS] [SEP]
myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to
share your restricted information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you may choose to use the
myspace services to access content pages, which are those pages that, for
example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a
collection of content such as audio tracks ( _e.g._ , "mixes"). [CLS] [SEP] when you
decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another member's
profile, a content page, or elsewhere on the myspace services, that
information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with
the visibility settings for the relevant profile or content, **even if those
settings are inconsistent with your own profile settings**. [CLS] [SEP] content pages are
generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those
pages will likely be available to anyone. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, your video viewing or
audio selections may be part of your profile content as well as any content
pages that you view. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you connect to a public profile, the fact
that you have connected to that public profile will be available to anybody
with access to the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

the profile settings that myspace makes available to members, as well as their
functionality, may change as the myspace services continue to evolve. [CLS] [SEP] we will
provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the profile settings
section, or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] delays and errors in effecting profile setting
preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate,
complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. [CLS] [SEP] if you experience any
problems with your profile settings, or have any questions or concerns
regarding your profile settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional
information regarding the settings options that may be available to you,
please contact us at the [help site](/help). [CLS] [SEP]

the myspace services may allow messaging between members. [CLS] [SEP] more information
about who can message whom is available [here](//help.myspace.com/hc/en-
us/articles/202274374-messaging-on-myspace-). [CLS] [SEP]

more detailed information about myspace's profile settings is available
[here](/settings/profile). [CLS] [SEP]

**account id and profile id**

when you create an account, myspace assigns an " **account id** " to identify
and organize information relating to your account and a " **profile id** " for
each profile associated with an account (collectively, your " **myspace ids**
"). [CLS] [SEP] the profile id may allow myspace to provide a unique internet url for your
profile (" **profile url** "). [CLS] [SEP] as described above, myspace ids and/or profile
urls always constitute public information and may therefore be viewed,
accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] you
cannot restrict access to public information through your profile settings,
and you cannot make your myspace ids and profile urls restricted information. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect or store as you access and use the myspace services

in addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the myspace
services, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain
information about you automatically, including through the use of various
technologies that passively store or collect certain information whenever you
interact with the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] this may include information about the
nature of a user's interactions with the myspace services, such as his or her
media consumption activities (" **usage information** "). [CLS] [SEP] usage information
may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies including cookies,
web beacons, embedded scripts, entity tags and other similar technologies
whether now or later devised (collectively " **web technologies** "), some of
which may be downloaded to the computer or other device. [CLS] [SEP] the usage information
that we collect may be non identifying or it may be associated with you, your
account, and your profile(s). [CLS] [SEP] in the event we collect certain information
about your interaction with the myspace services while you are a visitor,
myspace may associate that information with your account if you subsequently
become a member. [CLS] [SEP]

examples of the usage information we may collect include:

      * your ip address or unique device identifiers; 
      * your device functionality ( _e.g._ , browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information, _etc_.); 
      * the url that referred you to the myspace services;
      * the areas within the myspace services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or profiles or content pages you choose to connect with, _etc_.; 
      * your device location (including using gps and longitude and latitude location information); 
      * your device characteristics;
      * certain other device data ( _e.g._ , the time of day when the device is used); and 
      * ranking information about you with respect to other users or content pages that you interact with ( _e.g._ , myspace may record the links to content pages that you post and rank your association with that content compared to other users). [CLS] [SEP] 

please note that certain web technologies may set, change, alter, or modify
settings or configurations on your device. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, third parties may use
web technologies with the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on the
options that may be available to you for opting out of web technologies, see
section 5. [CLS] [SEP] you can also avoid the web technologies used on the myspace
services by not interacting with the myspace services and uninstalling any
mobile or other applications for which myspace is the application publisher. [CLS] [SEP]

more information related to cookies and other web technologies is available in
our [cookie policy](/pages/cookiepolicy). [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] information we receive from third-parties 

myspace may receive or collect certain information about you from third-party
websites, platforms, or services in the event you choose to take advantage of
various features that may allow you to integrate information on or to the
myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, myspace may provide you with the option to
voluntarily: (i) sync content from twitter that will appear on the myspace
services in your activity feed; (ii) authenticate your identity and register
for myspace using facebook's authentication protocol; or (iii) otherwise
integrate information from third-party sources. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, we may allow third-
party websites, platforms, or services to develop software applications that
you can elect to install on your account in order to provide additional
functionality to the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] these third party integrations and
applications are collectively referred to in this policy as " **third-party
linked services** ". [CLS] [SEP] should you voluntarily choose to take advantage of the
third-party linked services offered through the myspace services, we may
receive certain information about you from the relevant third-party providers,
including the following:

      * name
      * nickname or username
      * photo or graphic avatar
      * unique third-party website identifier ( _e.g._ , facebook user id) 
      * biographical information ( _e.g._ , professional title, gender, college attended, etc.) 
      * likes and interests
      * connections
      * content accessed or associated with your third party service account ( _e.g._ , articles, songs, videos) 
      * any information that is publicly available on third-party websites
      * device location (including gps and longitude and latitude location information)
      * other information that you choose to share with myspace

we may supplement or otherwise combine the information we collect directly
through the myspace services with information received or collected from our
affiliates or other third parties to deliver targeted advertising to you on
other websites across the internet and other platforms, services and networks,
including mobile and other connected device platforms, and for other purposes
not prohibited by this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

myspace will treat any information received from third parties (including
providers of third-party linked services) as set forth in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
however, the information practices of third parties are not governed by this
policy. [CLS] [SEP] myspace cannot control the treatment of your information by third
parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices, which may
differ from those described in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to review the
privacy policies and terms of service of any such third parties prior to
choosing to integrate and/or install them on your account or disclosing
information to them. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions regarding a third party's
information practices, you must contact the relevant entity directly. [CLS] [SEP]

if you visit any of our affiliates’ websites or use services provided by our
affiliates that are not part of the myspace services, please be aware that our
affiliates’ privacy policies will apply to their use of your information. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] information you provide about a third party

you may have the opportunity to communicate with others from the myspace
services, such as by sending an invitation to a friend. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to take
advantage of this functionality, we may ask you to provide us with certain
information about the person with whom you wish to communicate ( _e.g._ ,
name, e-mail address, mobile number, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] before you provide that
information to us, you must be sure that your friend has given you permission
to do that. [CLS] [SEP] myspace collects such information for the purposes of facilitating
the requested communication, which may contain a specific promotional message
from you ( _e.g._ , an invitation to register for the myspace services). [CLS] [SEP]
unless we explicitly say otherwise, myspace will not use this information for
other marketing purposes without first obtaining consent from the person to
whom the relevant information pertains. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that when you use any
send-to-a-friend functionality on the myspace services, your e-mail address,
mobile number, name or username, and message may be included in the
communication sent to your addressee(s). [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] myspace's use and disclosure of your information

we collect about you through the myspace services for any purposes not
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, including as follows:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] public information and myspace id

myspace may use and share your public information, including myspace ids, for
any reason in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] public information, including myspace ids, may

google). [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] restricted information and other information

myspace may also disclose any of your restricted information, and any other
information we have received from or about you, as set forth in the following
subsections. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, myspace may use and disclose your information for

services from the myspace services is governed by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] myspace is not
responsible for the data collection and privacy practices by the third-party
linked service provider, however. [CLS] [SEP] you are encouraged to review the privacy
policy and terms of service governing the use of the third-party linked
service in order to understand how the third-party linked service will use the

for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how users
are using and interacting with the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

these analytics providers may use their own web technologies to provide us
with these services and may otherwise collect or have access to information
about you, including your profile content, usage information and/or device
identifiers. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for those third-party web technologies or
activities arising out of them relating to information about you that the
analytic providers obtain directly from you or from third parties. [CLS] [SEP] some third-
party analytics providers may offer you certain choices regarding their
practices, some of which can be found here. [CLS] [SEP]

      5. [CLS] [SEP] to allow other users to find you

myspace uses public information and restricted information in connection with
user search inquiries to establish potential matches to search criteria using
tools made available as part of the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] we make good faith
efforts not to display to other users your restricted information except in
accordance with your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP] please note that members under the
self-reported age of 18 (other than respect to artist profiles for artists
whose indicated age is under the age of 18 and may appear in people browse
results) are not intended to show up in the results of myspace’s “people
browse” feature, which allows users to browse for members based on certain
criteria inputted by the user. [CLS] [SEP] please contact us [here](/help) if you notice
any discrepancy. [CLS] [SEP]

      6. [CLS] [SEP] to deliver relevant content and recommendations

to make your experience more interesting or relevant, we may use information
you provide, or that we collect about you (e.g., profile content, including
without limitation page views, queries, media consumption, and connections
between your profile and other profiles or content pages), and information we
may collect from other users and third parties (e.g., facebook or twitter), to
assist us in recommending member and content connections to you on myspace. [CLS] [SEP]
myspace may also combine your information with information collected by our
affiliates or others to improve the myspace services and to make content
recommendations to you both on and off of the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

      7. [CLS] [SEP] to create a social media consumption experience

as part of the myspace services, your usage information and profile content
(including video viewing and audio access) may be shared with other users. [CLS] [SEP] to
make your content consumption experience more social and fun, to improve
services, to perform analytics, to compare your usage to other users, to rank
your linkages with certain content or users, and to better make suggestions
about other content, we may use any of the information you provide and the
information we collect about you and we may share the content of the media
that you access on or through the myspace services with other users. [CLS] [SEP] we may
also share your media access through myspace services (including video viewing
and audio content access) as an activity notification by activity notification
by, for example, sharing your profile content (including your full name,
username and profile picture) on the content page where such video or audio
resides. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, your activity may be indicated on your own profile (in
your activity stream or elsewhere) and on your connections' profile, in each
case, both on the myspace website, and on any other myspace services,
including for example, any myspace mobile app. [CLS] [SEP] other examples of activities
that may generate activity notifications include, but are not limited to: (i)
posting status updates; (ii) commenting on a post; (iii) sharing content or
posting on the myspace services; (iv) sharing content or posting to a third-
party linked service; (v) connecting to a profile or content ( _e.g._ , a
photo, photo album, video, song, etc.); (vi) being tagged in a photo; (vii)
commenting on a photo album; (viii) adding a photo to a photo album; (ix)
playing a song or watching a video; (x) adding a song to a mix; (xi) updating
a profile; and (xii) adding a cover photo. [CLS] [SEP] an example of an actual activity
notification on the myspace services is the following: "john doe listened to
the song 'true love waits'." activity notifications may include profile
content ( _e.g._ , your full name and profile photo), and some may aggregate
your activity with activity of third parties ( _e.g._ , "john doe and sally
smith connected to a photo."). [CLS] [SEP]

**myspace makes this feature public to everyone by default, and anyone can see
these activity notifications.** note that if your profile is a restricted
profile, the profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will still see
your activity notifications regarding your content consumption on myspace. [CLS] [SEP]
from time-to-time we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out
on a session basis (that is, just for a single time when you are using the
myspace services), or a persistent basis (that is, for every time that you use
the myspace services), from activity notifications related to your content
consumption. [CLS] [SEP] session settings are intended to last only as long as your
myspace page is open in your browser. [CLS] [SEP] if you close your browser, the session-
based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play activity
notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your
profile's visibility. [CLS] [SEP] **you should always check the content consumption
activity notification setting each time you use the myspace services, so that
you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as
activity notifications.**

we may use usage information (such as about your media consumption,
connections to content pages or profiles, and posts regarding content pages or
profiles), and your profile content, to rank affinity to other profiles and
content. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to identify " **top fans** ", and we may use your
public information to display that you are a top fan of an artist, other
profile, or a piece of content. [CLS] [SEP] top fan status is public information – anyone
may see your status as a top fan. [CLS] [SEP] we also may provide analytics tools to
artist profiles that allow the owners of such artist profiles to see public
information of users who strongly engage with the artist profile or the
content pages controlled by the artist profile (e.g., videos or songs or such
artist profile), including users that are not connected to the artist profile. [CLS] [SEP]

**unless otherwise noted, your consumption of media on the myspace services
will be public information.**

**to provide activity notifications to provide activity notifications to
provide activity notifications**. [CLS] [SEP] for additional information on our video
sharing practices, please review the terms of the [video privacy
policy](videoprivacy), which supplement this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

      8. [CLS] [SEP] to contact you

myspace may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related
to myspace services or the services or products of myspace's partners to the
e-mail address you provided to us in your registration information or to the
messaging functionality of your profile(s). [CLS] [SEP] by maintaining an account and/or
using myspace services, you consent to the receipt of promotional materials or
notifications to your e-mail address or profile(s), unless you informed us
previously that you do not want to receive those messages, either when you set
up your account or later on. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to stop receiving promotional
materials from myspace, you may unsubscribe by changing your [profile
settings](/settings/notifications) or following the unsubscribe instructions
at the bottom of the relevant e-mail from myspace. [CLS] [SEP] please note that your opt-
out request will not apply to subsequent or different subscriptions, or to
certain administrative communications relating to your account or use of the
myspace services ( _e.g._ , service announcements). [CLS] [SEP] you will continue to
receive administrative messages from myspace even if you choose to opt-out
from receiving our marketing or promotional communications. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information, please see section 10 below titled "managing your
information on, and communications from, myspace."

      9. [CLS] [SEP] to deliver social advertising to you and your friends

many websites like myspace are free to users because they are supported by
advertising. [CLS] [SEP] while myspace no longer serves advertising to myspace users on
its website, if we resume ad serving in the future , you may be served ads
that are personalized based on, for example, your location, age, gender,
content consumption, connections and other information, and we and third
parties may use web technologies to deliver these ads. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we may
share your personal information, usage information, device identifiers, and
any other information that we receive or collect with third parties (including
our affiliates and our third-party advertising partners) in order to enable
customization of the advertising displayed on the myspace services, other
websites across the internet and other platforms, services and networks,
including mobile and other connected device platforms, and for other purposes
not prohibited by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] the parties with whom we may share your
information may supplement your information with information they receive
about you from others, in order to customize the advertisements they serve. [CLS] [SEP]
they may also, in turn, share your information with others. [CLS] [SEP]

      10. [CLS] [SEP] if we do resume serving advertisements as part of the myspace services in the future, we will update this policy and provide you with information on how you may adjust your privacy settings to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] how we protect your privacy when targeting ads to you

while we are not currently serving advertisements on myspace, our affiliates
or other third parties may use your personal data to deliver targeted
advertising to you on other websites across the internet and other platforms,
services and networks, including mobile and other connected device platforms,
and for other purposes not prohibited by this policy on other platforms or
websites. [CLS] [SEP] we use ad delivery technologies that encrypt information that would
otherwise identify you to prevent the third party advertiser from knowing who
you are. [CLS] [SEP] the encryption technologies that we use convert data that identifies
you (like a registered account name or e-mail address) into a string of
characters that cannot be turned back into information that identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] so
the third party that displays the ad to you will know that the ad is being
displayed to someone with certain characteristics ( _e.g._ , a woman in her
early twenties who likes to listen to rihanna and go to music events) but the
third party won’t have your name, e-mail address or any other information that
would allow them to identify you specifically. [CLS] [SEP] we add information about the
ads that have been shown to you and information about devices, purchasing or
online behavior associated with a particular encryption-generated identifier
to create a profile for that identifier. [CLS] [SEP] this profile helps us to better match
ads to your interests and avoid showing you the same ads too many times. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have a myspace account, we store that profile until you delete your
myspace account or change your personalized advertising settings to turn off
personalized advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

      11. [CLS] [SEP] to protect the rights of myspace and our users, and to comply with legal process

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, myspace may also disclose
user information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or
appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of
myspace or third parties (including through the enforcement of this policy,
our [terms of use](terms), and other applicable agreements and policies); or
(ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations ( _e.g._ , pursuant to law
enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, court orders or consent decrees). [CLS] [SEP] to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, myspace has complete discretion in
electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest
requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] more information is
available in our [law enforcement guidelines](//help.myspace.com/hc/en-
us/articles/202248100-law-enforcement-). [CLS] [SEP]

      12. [CLS] [SEP] business transfers

myspace may disclose user information in the event we file for bankruptcy, or
in connection with certain types of business transactions that result in
corporate change. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if myspace is or may be (or substantially all
of its assets are or may be) acquired by another party pursuant to an
acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, liquidation, asset exchange, or
similar business transfer, we may disclose and transfer user information to
the parties involved in the transaction ( _e.g._ , in connection with due
diligence efforts or as a transferred asset). [CLS] [SEP]

      13. [CLS] [SEP] co-branded areas

certain areas of the myspace services may be provided to you in association
with third parties (" **co-branded areas** ") such as sponsors, charities and
political organizations and will generally require you to disclose personal
information to them. [CLS] [SEP] such co-branded areas will identify the third party and
indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and
use of you information. [CLS] [SEP] if you elect to register for products and/or services,
communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications,
at co-branded areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the
third party. [CLS] [SEP] further, if you sign-in to a co-branded area with a username and
password obtained on the myspace services, your personal information may be
disclosed to the identified third parties for that co-branded area. [CLS] [SEP] we are not
responsible for such third party's data collection or practices and you should
look to such third-party privacy policies for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

      14. [CLS] [SEP] sweepstakes, contests and promotions

we may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (collectively, "
**promotions** ") through the myspace services that may require registration. [CLS] [SEP]
by participating in a promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that
govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you,
including, allowing the sponsor of the promotion to use your name, voice
and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. [CLS] [SEP] if
you choose to enter a promotion, personal information may be disclosed to
third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such
promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment,
and as required by law or permitted by the promotion's official rules, such as
on a winners list. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] choices regarding third-party tracking and targeting

this policy discloses how myspace collects, uses, discloses, retains, and
transfers your information and uses web technologies in connection with the
myspace services to which this policy applies. [CLS] [SEP] this policy does not govern the
collection, use, disclosure, retention, or transfer of your information or use
of web technologies by third parties outside of the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] the
collection, use, disclosure, retention, or transfer of your information or use
of web technologies by third parties is governed by the applicable third
parties' privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, you are encouraged to check those
privacy policies for information about their individual privacy practices. [CLS] [SEP] we
make no representations regarding the collection, use, disclosure, retention,
or transfer policies or practices of any third-parties. [CLS] [SEP]

  6. [CLS] [SEP] information for members and visitors located outside the united states

the myspace services are not available to users residing in russia. [CLS] [SEP] in certain
countries, such as those of the european union, you may have additional rights
in respect of the processing of your personal information, including the
existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify such information. [CLS] [SEP]
you may also have the right to ask us not to use certain web technologies
under our control or process certain of your personal information (or provide
it to third parties to process) for e-mail marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] while these
laws may not apply to myspace services, we offer certain options to non-us
residents:

      * **web technologies:** by using the myspace services, we are seeking to obtain your consent to the use web technologies (other than such technologies that we consider as strictly necessary where we do not require your consent) by providing you with transparent information in our policy and providing you with the opportunity to make your choice. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to provide us with your consent, you may elect to disable cookies (where not strictly necessary) by following the procedures identified in section 3.2 above and our [ cookie policy](/pages/cookiepolicy). [CLS] [SEP] where the web technologies are used by third parties, then your choices are outlined in section 4.2.9 and section 5 above; and 
      * **e-mail marketing communications:** we will seek your consent to opt-in to e-mail marketing communications where required by applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] you will always have a right to opt-out from e-mail marketing communications. [CLS] [SEP] for further information on your right to opt-out from communications for marketing purposes, please refer to section 4.2.8 and section 10. [CLS] [SEP] 

you can also exercise your options above, if applicable, at any time by
contacting us in the following ways:

myspace, you do so in the knowledge that the laws applicable in your home
country may not apply to protect your personal information or to your use of
the myspace services.**

**to the extent required by local law, by using the myspace services, you
consent to the transfer of your personal data to the united states. [CLS] [SEP] if you do
not agree to this international transfer of data, then you must refrain from
using the myspace services.**

users from the european economic area (" **eea** ") should also read our [eea
privacy notice](/pages/eeaprivacy). [CLS] [SEP] if there is any conflict between this
policy and our eea privacy notice, our eea privacy notice will take precedence
with respect to personal data of individuals who reside in the eea. [CLS] [SEP]

  7. [CLS] [SEP] how we safeguard user information

myspace takes reasonable precautions to preserve the integrity and security of
your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security
of any information accessed, stored or transmitted by myspace. [CLS] [SEP]

  8. [CLS] [SEP] protecting children's privacy

myspace understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the
interactive world. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use the myspace services to knowingly collect
personal information from children under the age of 13, and do not allow
children under sixteen (16) years old to use the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
under sixteen (16) years old, you may not create a myspace user account and
should not send any information about yourself to us through the myspace
services. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event that myspace becomes aware that we have collected personal
information from any child, we will dispose of that information in accordance
with the children's online privacy protection act and other applicable laws
and regulations. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your
child under the age of 13 years old has provided us with information without
your consent, please contact us [here](/help) and we will take reasonable
steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our systems. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] if there are changes to the policy

myspace may modify this policy and/or profile setting options at any time. [CLS] [SEP]
however, if we make material changes to this policy that expand our rights to
use your personal information, we will notify you either through a myspace
message, e-mail, and/or a prominent notice at the myspace website, or as
otherwise required or permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] you express your affirmative consent
to any material changes if you choose to continue using the myspace services
following notice of these changes in this manner. [CLS] [SEP] your participation in and
use of the myspace services is entirely voluntarily, and you may choose to
cease to using the myspace services and/or to terminate your account and its
associated profile(s) at any time and for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

  10. [CLS] [SEP] managing your information on, and communications from, myspace

we provide you with the ability, through your profile settings, to access,
edit, or delete certain of your registration information and profile content. [CLS] [SEP]
to do so, follow the steps outlined [here](/settings/profile). [CLS] [SEP] please note
that certain registration information is required to maintain an account;
therefore, if you desire to delete required registration information, you will
have to delete your account and associated profiles. [CLS] [SEP] if you no longer want to
use the myspace services, you may cancel your account at any time. [CLS] [SEP] even after
you cancel your account or delete information or profile content, copies of
some information from your account or profile(s) may remain viewable in
circumstances where, for example, you have posted information on another
user's profile, shared information with a third-party linked service, or if
another visitor or member copied, stored or shared your information or has a
copy of the link to content you shared on the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent
permitted by applicable law, we may also retain backup information related to
your account and associated profile(s) on our servers for as long as is
reasonably necessary after cancellation for fraud detection, site operation or
to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. [CLS] [SEP] please be
aware that, due to the nature of certain internet and mobile technologies
outside of our control, such as caching and networked technology, your account
may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the
removal of your information and content from elsewhere on the internet and
from search engines. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not want to receive promotional (i.e., commercial) e-mail from us in
the future, please contact us [here](/help). [CLS] [SEP] myspace communicates with you for
a number of different purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to stop receiving commercial
e-mail from us for a specific purpose, multiple purposes or all purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you
will also have the option of clicking on a link included in e-mail
correspondence you receive from us in order to remove yourself from one or
more of our types of communications. [CLS] [SEP] you may also opt-out of certain myspace
communications via profile settings [here](/settings/profile). [CLS] [SEP] please note
that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to
"opt-out" and when it is processed and reflected in our systems. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly
you may continue to receive communications from us for a limited time after
you unsubscribe. [CLS] [SEP] if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails, the
opt-out will be so limited. [CLS] [SEP] please note that we reserve the right to send you
certain administrative communications relating to your account or use of the
myspace services, such as service announcements, even if you choose to opt-out
from receiving our marketing or promotional communications. [CLS] [SEP]

2018 (“ccpa”), and applies to personal information, whether collected online
or offline. [CLS] [SEP] as used in this section of the privacy policy, “ **personal
information** ” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes,
is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked,

**categories of personal information that we collect and disclose**  
our collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a california
resident will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of our
interactions or relationship with such resident. [CLS] [SEP] the table below sets out

**categories of personal information sold.** the ccpa defines a “sale” as
disclosing or making available to a third-party personal information in
exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and we are required to
disclose information to you about sales of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] within
the past twelve (12) months we disclosed or made available personal
information to our affiliates and third parties for targeted behavioral
advertising purposes, including:

    * demographic information, contact information and other identifiers (encrypted as described in section 4.2.9) 
    * internet or other electronic network activity information
    * geolocation data
  

**your rights and choices under the ccpa**  
the ccpa provides california residents with specific rights regarding their
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] this section describes your rights under the ccpa and
explains how to exercise those rights. [CLS] [SEP] subject to certain exceptions,
california residents have the right to make the following requests:

**right to opt-out of sale** (do-not-sell): you have the right to direct us
not to sell your personal information (“opt-out’). [CLS] [SEP] we do not sell personal
information if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16
years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (“opt-in’) from
either the consumer between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian
of a consumer less than 13 years of age. [CLS] [SEP]

if you prefer that we not sell your personal information you may submit a

non-california sections of this privacy policy for information about our use
of cookies and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

**request to delete** : you have the right to request that we delete and
direct any service providers that have received that personal information to
delete, the personal information that we have collected from you and retained,
unless an exemption applies. [CLS] [SEP] once we receive and confirm your verifiable

(and, if applicable, direct our service providers to delete) any other
personal information from our records, unless an exemption applies. [CLS] [SEP]

**request to know** : you have the right to request that we disclose certain
information to you about our collection and use of your personal information

we will respond to verifiable requests received from california residents as
required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

**agents**. [CLS] [SEP] you can also designate an authorized agent to make a request under
the ccpa on your behalf, but such agent must be registered as required by the
ccpa and provide proof that the agent is authorized to make a request on your
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] so, we may ask you for additional information necessary to verify or
process your request. [CLS] [SEP] where applicable, we may ask for proof that an
authorized agent is entitled to act on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

**verification and response process**. [CLS] [SEP] we may carry out checks, including with
third party identity verification services, to verify your identity before
taking any action with your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we will endeavor to respond
your verifiable requests within 45 days of receipt. [CLS] [SEP] if we require more time
(up to 45 additional days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
period in writing. [CLS] [SEP] any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month
period preceding the verifiable consumer request receipt. [CLS] [SEP] generally,
california residents can exercise their ccpa rights free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

**non-discrimination**. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right not to receive discriminatory
treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] we
will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your ccpa rights or
impose unreasonable requirements on financial incentives offered to california
consumers related to your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we may offer different prices,
rates, or quality of goods or services if the difference is reasonably related
to the value of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

## key terms

**cookies**. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to
visit the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] a flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a
data file placed on a device via the adobe flash plug-in that may be built-in
to or downloaded by you to your device. [CLS] [SEP] html5 cookies can be programmed
through html5 local storage. [CLS] [SEP] unlike flash cookies, html5 cookies do not
require a plug-in. [CLS] [SEP] regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by
tools that are available as part of most commercial internet browsers, and in
some instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. [CLS] [SEP]
each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers
offer different functionality and options in this regard. [CLS] [SEP] also, these tools
may not be effective with regard to flash cookies or html5 cookies. [CLS] [SEP] for
information on disabling flash cookies go to adobe's website
[www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/). [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that if you disable or
remove cookies, flash cookies, or html5 cookies on your device, some parts of
the myspace services may not function properly, and that when you revisit the
myspace services your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser
settings and limitations. [CLS] [SEP]

**device.** the personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other
handheld device, internet connected television or other device that you use to
access the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

**device identifier.** a unique string of numbers, letters or characters that
is automatically assigned to your device used to access the myspace services
that allows our servers to identify your device. [CLS] [SEP]

**embedded scripts**. [CLS] [SEP] an embedded script is programming code that is designed
to collect information about your interactions with the myspace services, such
as the links you click on. [CLS] [SEP] the code is temporarily downloaded onto your device
from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while
you are connected to the myspace services, and is deactivated or deleted
thereafter. [CLS] [SEP]

**etag, or entity tag**. [CLS] [SEP] a feature of the cache in browsers. [CLS] [SEP] it is an opaque
identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found
at a url. [CLS] [SEP] if the resource content at that url ever changes, a new and
different etag is assigned. [CLS] [SEP] used in this manner etags are a form of device
identifier. [CLS] [SEP] etag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the
consumer blocks http, flash, and/or html5 cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

**web beacons**. [CLS] [SEP] small graphic images or other web programming code called web
beacons (also known as "1x1 gifs" or "clear gifs") may be included in the
myspace services' pages and messages. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons may be invisible to you, but
any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or
e-mail can act as a web beacon. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons or similar technologies may be
used for a number of purposes, including to: count visitors to the myspace
services, to monitor how users navigate the myspace services, to count how
many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many
particular articles or links were actually viewed. [CLS] [SEP]
