the let’s encrypt privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose
your information in three different contexts:

  * when, as a relying party, you visit a web site secured with https that uses a certificate from let’s encrypt,
  * when you are a subscriber, i.e., when you request and use certificates from let’s encrypt,
  * when you are a visitor to the let’s encrypt web site, community discussion forum, other web pages under letsencrypt.org, and third-party social media sites on which let’s encrypt operates an account. [CLS] [SEP]

let's encrypt is a service provided by [internet security research
group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/), a california (united states)
nonprofit public benefit corporation. [CLS] [SEP]

## relying party

when you use an https web site or other tls service with a let’s encrypt
certificate, your browser (or tls client) may query let’s encrypt to check
whether the certificate has been revoked (“ocsp request”). [CLS] [SEP] if your browser
makes an ocsp request, our servers will automatically record your ip address,
browser, and operating system in temporary server log files. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use
data from ocsp requests to build profiles or identify individuals. [CLS] [SEP] temporary
server logs are used for operational purposes only and are normally deleted in
less than seven days. [CLS] [SEP] we may retain a subset of server logs for longer periods
in order to investigate software failures or abuse. [CLS] [SEP] if we do so, we will
delete any stored logs when we are done investigating. [CLS] [SEP] we may also compute,
retain and publish aggregate information from server logs, such as which
certificates generate the largest volume of requests. [CLS] [SEP] we will always strive to
ensure that such datasets do not contain information about the activities of
identifiable users or devices. [CLS] [SEP]

## subscriber

if you are a subscriber, you are requesting a trusted certificate from let’s
encrypt intended to publicly vouch that you control a certain domain name or
names that are reachable on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] as part of the process of proving
that control, let’s encrypt will collect various information related to
certificate authentication and management. [CLS] [SEP] that information includes the ip
addresses from which you access the let’s encrypt service; all resolved ip
addresses for any domain names requested; server information related to any
validation requests; full logs of all inbound http / acme requests, all
outbound validation requests; and information sent by or inferred from your
client software. [CLS] [SEP] we will store this information for a minimum of seven years
per trusted root program requirements. [CLS] [SEP] this information will be stored for a
maximum of ten years. [CLS] [SEP]

we need to be able to demonstrate to the public, including those who rely on
the trustworthiness of our certificates, that our services perform as
expected. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, we may be unable to delete information, including ip
addresses. [CLS] [SEP] this information may be made public in a number of ways, including
via public api, public repositories, and/or public discussions. [CLS] [SEP]

you may have the option to provide contact information, such as your email
address, for account service and recovery purposes. [CLS] [SEP] your contact information
will not be made public, and it will only be shared per “law enforcement and
extenuating circumstances,” below. [CLS] [SEP] by providing your email address, you are
consenting to receive service-related emails from us. [CLS] [SEP] you may unsubscribe from
service-related emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the
bottom of our emails or by contacting us at
[security@letsencrypt.org](mailto:security@letsencrypt.org). [CLS] [SEP] we will not use
your contact information for marketing or promotional purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

you may need to download client software from a repository such as those run
by debian, ubuntu, red hat, or github. [CLS] [SEP] your interaction with such a software
repository is governed by that repository’s own privacy policy and/or terms of
use. [CLS] [SEP]

## visitor

when you are a visitor browsing the let’s encrypt web site, you have the
option to make a donation. [CLS] [SEP] donations are processed by our trusted payment
partners including donorbox, stripe, shopify, and paypal, depending on the
payment method selected. [CLS] [SEP] we collect your name and email address when you
donate. [CLS] [SEP] we will not use your email address to contact you without your consent
unless we feel it's necessary to resolve an issue related to a particular
donation. [CLS] [SEP] your interactions with [donorbox](https://donorbox.org/privacy),
[stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy/), and
[paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) are governed
by their respective privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect or retain any credit
card or bank information related to donations. [CLS] [SEP] if we collect a physical
address, we will only retain your physical address information for as long as
is reasonably necessary to make the shipment that you requested. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the option to provide your email address to receive the let’s encrypt
newsletter through a signup on this web site and via other marketing
materials. [CLS] [SEP] the newsletter is delivered via mailchimp and your interactions
with mailchimp are governed by its privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we may occasionally use
your email address to send personalized communications related to let’s
encrypt. [CLS] [SEP] you can request to have your email address removed from our list by
opting out via mailchimp or emailing us at
[press@letsencrypt.org](mailto:press@letsencrypt.org)

if you register to use the let’s encrypt community support forum, the personal
information you provide and your actions there are governed by the privacy
policy of our hosting and software provider for the forum, [civilized
discourse construction kit](https://www.discourse.org/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] we do not
collect or maintain personal information through our offering of this support
forum. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, we use google analytics to gauge traffic and popular pages on
our web site. [CLS] [SEP] as part of that service, we place google analytics cookies on
our site. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies do not contain personal information but can uniquely
identify your browser software over time on our site. [CLS] [SEP] we respect the [do not
track](http://donottrack.us/) header by strictly limiting the information our
analytics services can collect and share for all visitors. [CLS] [SEP]

## we do not sell your data or information

we do not sell your data or information. [CLS] [SEP] this includes relying party,
subscriber, and visitor data and information. [CLS] [SEP]

## law enforcement requests and extenuating circumstances

to the extent we possess it, we may disclose personally identifiable
information about you to third parties in limited circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] such
circumstances include when we have your consent or when we have a good faith
belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial
or administrative order. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose account recovery information
when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, damage to property, or significant financial harm. [CLS] [SEP]

if we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted,
we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited, or
it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order
to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] we will attempt to
provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your
information. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, we reserve the right, solely at our discretion, to independently
object to certain requests (for access to information about users of our
products and technologies) that we believe to be improper. [CLS] [SEP]

## what rights do european economic area relying parties, subscribers, and
visitors have under gdpr, and how can i exercise them?

addresses, as this information is necessary for others to rely on in
determining the trustworthiness of our certificates. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may
process personal data pursuant to legal obligation or to protect your vital
interests or those of another person. [CLS] [SEP]

your personal data may be collected from or transferred to jurisdictions where
we and our service providers store or process data, including the united

data of eea residents, including by entering into data processing agreements
using the european commission-approved standard contractual clauses, or by
using other safeguards approved by the european commission. [CLS] [SEP] you have a right
to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is
transferring outside the eu by emailing us at the contact information below. [CLS] [SEP]
