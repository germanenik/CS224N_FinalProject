# privacy policy: software and technology projects

## privacy policy: software and technology projects

this policy describes our privacy practices for the information that's
collected and used by eff software and technology projects, like https
everywhere, the decentralized ssl observatory, or privacy badger (but not
certbot or panopticlick, which have their own policies—see below). [CLS] [SEP] we may
occasionally update this document or the relevant user interfaces to reflect
changes in the information that we collect or new products or technologies we
release. [CLS] [SEP] however, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with eff's
mission and will be available at <https://www.eff.org/code/privacy-policy>. [CLS] [SEP]

unless otherwise specified, this policy does not apply to projects run by
individuals or organizations outside of eff, such as tor, otr, or gnupg, even
if we promote the use of those projects or happen to contribute to them. [CLS] [SEP]

eff is located within the united states, and therefore will transfer, process,
and store your information in the united states, which may not provide as much
protection as your home country. [CLS] [SEP] (we’re
[working](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) to make us practices better.)

**software downloads:** if you download and install software from eff's web
site, we may collect information about your visit to our site. [CLS] [SEP] once installed,
our software may also connect automatically to our site to attempt to
determine if updated versions are available. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, our site may log
information related to the software downloads, such as your computer's ip
address. [CLS] [SEP] our collection, anonymization, and use of that data is described our
[web site privacy policy](https://www.eff.org/policy). [CLS] [SEP]

if you download or receive eff software from another source, such as the
chrome web store; google play store; addons.mozilla.org; github; or package
repositories like those run by debian, ubuntu, or red hat; your interaction
with that site is governed by its privacy policy, which may be less protective
than eff's policies. [CLS] [SEP] eff cannot supervise or control the use of personal
information by non-eff software download sources. [CLS] [SEP]

**bug reports and research datasets:** eff software and technology projects
may give you the option to submit bug reports to us, either manually or (if
you opt-in) automatically, such as when an error occurs. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you
disable https everywhere on a particular site, that may be indicative of bugs
in the ruleset for that site. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to submit reports, the content of
those reports will be available to the project developers, which may include
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] the software user interface will describe the contents of the
report and the retention policies in further detail. [CLS] [SEP] we may disclose bug
reports to people as necessary to improve the software or technology project. [CLS] [SEP]

sometimes our software and technology projects may collect other types of
information to help with technology research, which generally will not include
personally identifiable information. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, the ssl observatory
collects ssl/tls certificates and associated metadata. [CLS] [SEP] when our software
collects such information, its user interfaces will explain what it does, and
let you enable or disable submissions. [CLS] [SEP] this information may be included in
datasets, which are discussed below. [CLS] [SEP]

**use of information:** in general, eff uses the information provided by you
to further its mission, including to strengthen internet security and privacy,
defend freedom and innovation, and to protect your rights in the digital
world. [CLS] [SEP] to help you better understand how this information further these goals,
we may include further explanations of the use of data within the project’s
user interface. [CLS] [SEP]

**disclosure of your information:** while eff endeavors to provide the highest
level of protection for your information, we may disclose personally
identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances,
including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it
is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or
administrative order. [CLS] [SEP]

if we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted,
we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited or
it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order
to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] we will attempt to
provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your
information. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, we will independently object to requests for access to
information about users of our products and technologies that we believe to be
improper and we have done so. [CLS] [SEP]

## updating or removing your information

we endeavor not to collect personal data from users, but recognize that you
may choose to provide such information in a bug report. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to
correct, update, access or delete the personal information you have submitted
to us by sending an email to
[privacypolicy@eff.org](mailto:privacypolicy@eff.org). [CLS] [SEP]

**data storage and retention**

eff’s [general privacy policy](https://www.eff.org/policy) covers the storage
and retention policies for our server logs and direct communications with eff. [CLS] [SEP]

if you submit a bug report or contribute to a research dataset, we will
maintain this information for as long as we believe it is relevant to
improving the software or technology project. [CLS] [SEP] generally, we do not store
personally identifiable information (pii), including the ip addresses of
users, when collecting bug reports or research data. [CLS] [SEP] however, on occasion, we
may store ip addresses for limited debugging purposes. [CLS] [SEP] (you may also choose to
submit these reports and data via tor in order to prevent us from being able
to observe your ip address.)

**contacting eff**

if you have any questions about our privacy and data protection practices, you
can reach eff at:

electronic frontier foundation  
815 eddy street  
san francisco, ca 94109 usa  
phone: +1-415-436-9333  
fax: +1-415-436-9993  
email: [privacypolicy@eff.org](mailto:privacypolicy@eff.org). [CLS] [SEP]

if our processing of your personal data is covered by eu law, you may also
lodge a complaint with the relevant [data protection supervisory
authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-
protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) for your country of residence. [CLS] [SEP]

**sharing of datasets:** from time to time, we may share datasets derived from
our technology projects with research partners working on topics related to
internet security, censorship resistance, privacy or other public policy
objectives. [CLS] [SEP] we may also publish datasets in an effort to further these
objectives. [CLS] [SEP] the datasets we may share or publish will not intentionally
contain pii and we will evaluate whether further sanitization or aggregation
of data is necessary to reduce the likelihood that inferences about
identifiable individuals' activities might be made from the published dataset. [CLS] [SEP]
because anonymization is an algorithmically complex problem, we cannot promise
that it will be flawless or attack-proof. [CLS] [SEP] when we believe that a dataset may
contain information that is especially sensitive or vulnerable to de-
anonymization, we will not publish it, and if we share share such data with
research partners, we will place them under a contractual obligation to keep
the dataset confidential and avoid de-anonymization. [CLS] [SEP]

**security:** eff employs industry standard security measures to protect the
loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including
appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk, such as the pseudonymization and encryption
of personal data, data backup systems, and engaging security professionals to
evaluate our systems effectiveness. [CLS] [SEP] although we make good faith efforts to
store information collected by eff in a secure operating environment, we
cannot guarantee complete security. [CLS] [SEP]

**privacy policies for specific software and technology projects:** some of
the technology projects from eff may have specific privacy policies associated
with them. [CLS] [SEP] when we launch projects with their own privacy policies, they will
be linked to from this page. [CLS] [SEP]
