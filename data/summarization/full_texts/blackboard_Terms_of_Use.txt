# blackboard terms of use

## welcome to blackboard®

important--please read carefully. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a resident of or have your
principal place of business in the european economic area, these terms of use
("terms") are an agreement between you and blackboard international b.v., a
private company formed and existing under the laws of the netherlands. [CLS] [SEP]
otherwise, these terms are an agreement between you and blackboard inc., a
delaware corporation. [CLS] [SEP] references to "us", "we", "our", and "blackboard" shall
mean either blackboard international b.v. [CLS] [SEP] or blackboard inc., as appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms govern your access to and use of blackboard software, products,
and/or services (individually or collectively, the "products") and any
information, content, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded,
downloaded, purchased, or appearing on or through the products (collectively
referred to as "content"). [CLS] [SEP] additional terms or product requirements may apply
to our individual products and are available with the relevant product. [CLS] [SEP] these
terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access and use the products
("users"). [CLS] [SEP]

by accessing or using the products you agree to be bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

please read these terms carefully to ensure that you understand each
provision. [CLS] [SEP] these terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration and class
action/jury trial waiver provision that, to the extent applicable to you,
requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes,
rather than jury trials or class actions. [CLS] [SEP]

notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these terms supersedes or limits
your rights under (1) the terms and conditions of any written agreement you
have entered into with blackboard regarding the use of products, or (2)
applicable laws or regulations to the extent these terms are prohibited by
such laws or regulations. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any conflict between these terms and
the terms and conditions of an applicable written agreement you have entered
into with blackboard, the terms and conditions of the written agreement shall
control. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] basic terms & accounts

you are responsible for your use of the products. [CLS] [SEP] you may use the products
only if you can form a binding contract with blackboard. [CLS] [SEP] your account with
blackboard (and use of the product) gives you access to the services and
functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our
sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] we may maintain different types of accounts for different
types of users. [CLS] [SEP] if you are accepting these terms and using the products on
behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, then (a)
“you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you
are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the
entity to these terms, and that you agree to these terms on the entity’s
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] you may use the products only in compliance with these terms, any
agreement entered into by your institution relating to the products, and all
applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and
regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

in cases where you have authorized or registered another individual, including
a minor, to use your account(s), you are fully responsible for (i) the online
conduct of such user; (ii) controlling the user’s access to and use of the
products; and (iii) the consequences of any misuse. [CLS] [SEP] blackboard requires that
the parents, guardian, or other authorized adult or educational institution of
a minor affirmatively consent to the use of a blackboard product by such
minor. [CLS] [SEP] blackboard reserves the right to provide access to the minor’s account
to the minor’s parents, guardian or other authorized adult or educational
institution, upon such adult’s request. [CLS] [SEP] for additional information on how we
use your information, please see our [privacy policy](/privacy_statement). [CLS] [SEP]

you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve
the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other
users. [CLS] [SEP] blackboard shall have no liability for your interactions with other
users, nor for any user’s acts or omissions. [CLS] [SEP]

name, email address, and any other information including personal information

your use of the products (“ **your information** ”), will be collected,
maintained and used in order to provide the products to you or your
institution, or in accordance with these terms, our privacy policy located
[here](/privacy_statement) ("privacy policy"), any additional terms applicable
to an individual product, and any agreement entered into by your institution
relating to the product. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that, through your use of the
products, you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in these terms,
the privacy policy and any agreement entered into by your institution relating
to the product) of your information, including the transfer of your
information to the united states and/or other countries for storage, hosting,

to all student data you provide or otherwise make available to us, and we do
not own, control, or license such student data, except so as to provide the
products to you and to the educational institution that provides the products
and controls student data from the educational records, if applicable, and as
described herein. [CLS] [SEP] “student data” is any information (in any format) that is
directly related to an identifiable current or former student that is
maintained by a school, school district, or related entity or organization, or
by us, as part of the provision of the products. [CLS] [SEP] student data may include
“educational records” as defined by the family educational rights and privacy
act (“ferpa”), 20 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] § 1232(g). [CLS] [SEP] blackboard agrees to treat student data as

obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents as may be

users of the products to do the same. [CLS] [SEP] we will respond to notices of alleged

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] termination

we may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or
part of the products at any time for any reason, including, but not limited
to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these terms, (ii) you

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimers & limitations of liability

please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of blackboard
and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and/or licensors
(collectively, the “blackboard entities”). [CLS] [SEP] each of the subsections below only
applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in
this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be
lawfully limited. [CLS] [SEP]

### a. [CLS] [SEP] the products are available “as-is”

your access to and use of the products or any content are at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP]
you understand and agree that the products are provided to you on an “as is”
and “as available” basis. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, the blackboard entities disclaim all
warranties and conditions, whether express or implied, of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or
information, whether oral or written, obtained from any of the blackboard
entities or through the products will create any warranty not expressly made
herein. [CLS] [SEP]

### b. [CLS] [SEP] hipaa disclaimer

blackboard does not warrant or provide any assurances that your use of the
products will comply with the health insurance portability and accountability
act of 1996, as amended (“hipaa”). [CLS] [SEP] if you are a health care provider, health
plan, insurer, health care information clearinghouse or other entity that may
be considered a “covered entity” under hipaa or a “business associate” of a
“covered entity” under hipaa, you shall take all steps necessary to comply
with hipaa and shall be responsible for any applicable compliance with hipaa. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that you will not provide blackboard with any protected health
information (as that term is defined under hipaa) and that blackboard is
therefore not deemed to be a business associate of you and/or your institution
for purposes of compliance with hipaa. [CLS] [SEP]

### c. [CLS] [SEP] third-party links and resources

the products may contain links to third-party websites or resources. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge and agree that the blackboard entities are not responsible or
liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or
(ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or
resources. [CLS] [SEP] links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by
the blackboard entities of such websites or resources or the content,
products, or services available from such websites or resources. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use
of any such websites or resources. [CLS] [SEP] if you access a third-party website or
service from a product or share your content on or through any third-party
website or service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these
terms and the privacy policy do not apply to your use of such sites. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, to the extent you access services or content provided by youtube
through the products, you agree to be bound by the youtube terms of service
located at: <https://www.youtube.com/t/terms>. [CLS] [SEP]

### d. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the blackboard entities
shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, good-will, or other
intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to
access or use the products; (ii) any conduct or content of any user or other
third party on, through, or associated with the products, including without
limitation, any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or
third parties; (iii) any content obtained from the products; or (iv)
unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content. [CLS] [SEP]

in no event shall the aggregate liability of the blackboard entities exceed
the greater of one hundred u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars (u.s. [CLS] [SEP] $100.00) or the amount you paid
blackboard, if any, in the past six months for the products giving rise to the
claim. [CLS] [SEP]

the limitations of this subsection shall apply to any theory of liability,
whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or
otherwise, and whether or not the blackboard entities have been informed of
the possibility of any such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is
found to have failed of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

federal law, some states, provinces, and other jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above
exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] these terms give you specific legal rights,
and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] further, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or
exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] the disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations
of liability under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

### e. [CLS] [SEP] indemnity

you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless blackboard and its
subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and
their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against
any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt,
and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i)
your use of and access to a product, including any data or content transmitted
or received by you; (ii) your violation of any provision of these terms,
including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and
warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including
without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv)
your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any content that
is submitted via your user account including without limitation misleading,
false, or inaccurate information; (vi) your willful misconduct; or (vii) any
other party’s access and use of a product with your unique username, password
or other appropriate security code. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] general terms

### a. [CLS] [SEP] waiver & severability

the failure of blackboard to enforce any right or provision of these terms
will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that any
provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that
provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and
the remaining provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect;
except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal class
action/jury trial waiver set forth in section 11(b)(iii) below, the entire
arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. [CLS] [SEP]

### b. [CLS] [SEP] governing law; dispute resolution

_(i) governing law._ these terms and any action related thereto will be
governed by the laws of the state of new york without regard to or application
of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. [CLS] [SEP] all
claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the
products will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in
washington, d.c., united states, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and
venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _(ii) arbitration._ read this section carefully because it requires the
parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can
seek relief from blackboard. [CLS] [SEP] for any dispute with blackboard, you agree to
first contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#c88fada6adbaa9a48ba7bda6bbada488aaa4a9aba3aaa7a9baace6aba7a5) and
attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. [CLS] [SEP] in the unlikely event that
blackboard has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty
(60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy
(excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided
below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these terms, or the
breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by jams, under the
optional expedited arbitration procedures then in effect for jams, except as
provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] jams may be contacted at
[www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be conducted
in washington, d.c., united states, unless you and blackboard agree otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]
if you are using the products for commercial purposes, each party will be
responsible for paying any jams filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in
accordance with jams rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall
include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs
for expert and other witnesses. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual using the products
for non-commercial purposes: (i) jams may require you to pay a fee for the
initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee
waiver from jams; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your
costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable
costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims
court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but
this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
resolution process. [CLS] [SEP] any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this section
shall be deemed as preventing blackboard from seeking injunctive or other
equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or
threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security,
intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _(iii) class action/jury trial waiver._ with respect to all person and
entities, regardless whether they have obtained or used the products for
personal, commercial, or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the
parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or
other representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] this waiver applies to class arbitration, and
unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
(1) person’s claims. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that, by entering into these terms, you and
blackboard are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in
a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
representative proceeding of any kind relating to the products or these terms. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _(iv) limited applicability of arbitration and class action/jury trial
waiver._ certain laws, rules, and regulations that may apply to you may not
allow you to pre-agree to binding arbitration or waive your rights to join in
a representative proceeding or waive your rights to a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] if such laws
apply to you, the arbitration requirements set forth in subsection (ii) and/or
the class action/jury trial waiver set forth in subsection (iii) do not apply
to you. [CLS] [SEP]
