agreement") govern your relationship with the 1password service (the
"service") operated by agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("us", "we", or "our"). [CLS] [SEP] it is important
that you read this carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

your access to and use of the service is based on your acceptance of and
compliance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP] these terms apply to all visitors, users,
customers, and others who access or use the service. [CLS] [SEP]

by accessing or using the service you agree to be bound by these terms and
accept all legal consequences. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the terms and conditions
of this agreement, in whole or in part, please do not use the service. [CLS] [SEP]

## description of service

the âserviceâ means (a) agilebitsâ password managing, secure document
storing, administrative and related systems and technologies, as well as the
website <https://1password.com> (the âsiteâ), and (b) all software
(including the software, as defined below), applications, data, text, images,
and other content made available by or on behalf of agilebits. [CLS] [SEP] any
modifications to the service are also subject to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] agilebits
reserves the right to modify or discontinue the service or any feature or
functionality thereof at any time without notice. [CLS] [SEP] all rights, title and
interest in and to the service will remain with and belong exclusively to
agilebits. [CLS] [SEP]

## subscriptions

some parts of the service are billed on a subscription basis
("subscription(s)"). [CLS] [SEP] you will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic
basis ("billing cycle"). [CLS] [SEP] billing cycles are set on a regular basis, typically
monthly or yearly. [CLS] [SEP]

at the end of each billing cycle, your subscription will automatically renew
under the same conditions unless you cancel it or agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] cancels it. [CLS] [SEP]
you may cancel your subscription renewal either through your online account
management page or by contacting agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] customer support team. [CLS] [SEP]

a valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
payment for your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] you shall provide agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] or its third-
party payment processor, with accurate and complete billing information
including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method
information. [CLS] [SEP] by submitting such payment information, you automatically
authorize agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] to charge all subscription fees incurred through
your account to any such payment instruments. [CLS] [SEP] all amounts paid are non-
refundable. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with
the service, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by
your financial institution and intermediaries. [CLS] [SEP] all amounts are in us dollars. [CLS] [SEP]

## free trial

agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free
trial for a limited period of time ("free trial"). [CLS] [SEP]

you may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for
the free trial. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do enter your billing information when signing up for the free trial,
you will not be charged by agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] until the free trial has expired. [CLS] [SEP]
on the last day of the free trial period, unless you cancelled your
subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription
fees for the type of subscription you have selected. [CLS] [SEP]

at any time and without notice, agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] reserves the right to (i)
modify the terms and conditions of the free trial offer, or (ii) cancel such
free trial offer. [CLS] [SEP]

## fee changes

agilebits, inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
subscription fees for the subscriptions. [CLS] [SEP] any subscription fee change will
become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. [CLS] [SEP]

agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in
subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription
before such change becomes effective. [CLS] [SEP]

your continued use of the service after the subscription fee change comes into
effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount. [CLS] [SEP]

## refunds

while all amounts paid are non-refundable, certain refund requests for
subscriptions may be considered by agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] on a case-by-case basis and
granted at the sole discretion of agilebits, inc.. [CLS] [SEP]

## accounts

breach of the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the
service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your
password is with our service or a third party service. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you must notify us
immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use
of your account. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is
not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any
rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate
authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. [CLS] [SEP]

## operational emails

the service may send operational emails including but not limited to: billing

provide the service. [CLS] [SEP]

## termination

you are entitled to cease using our services at any time and for any reason
without notice to us, but you will continue to be charged for services until
you cancel your account by logging in or contacting us. [CLS] [SEP]

our duty is to keep our service as safe and well maintained as possible. [CLS] [SEP] to
this end, we may need to terminate accounts for violations of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] in
the following circumstances we will provide notice to you prior to termination
of your account: (a) you are in breach of these terms; or (b) you are using
our services in a way that can cause or has caused a risk of harm or loss to
either agilebits or our other customers. [CLS] [SEP]

in such an event our notice will be via email to all or any of the registered
account holders, which includes but is not limited to "family organizers" and
"team owners" as they are listed in your account at the time of notice. [CLS] [SEP] if you
remedy the issues that cause us to send the notice, to our satisfaction, then
we will not terminate your access or license to our services. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
remedy the outstanding causes of our termination notice in these
circumstances, then we will terminate your account. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of such a
termination we will provide you with the ability to take your data with you. [CLS] [SEP]

there are three very limited circumstances in which we will be unable to send
notice to you prior to terminating your access to our services: (i) you are in
material breach of these terms in such a way as to immediately and seriously
endanger us and other users; (ii) we are unable to send you notice because
this would cause us legal liability or a disruption to our service; and (iii)
we are unable to notify you due to law. [CLS] [SEP] if we terminate your account for the
reasons outlined in i-iii, then we will work with you to ensure you retain
copies of your data, wherever permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

all provisions of the terms shall survive termination, including without
limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
limitations of liability. [CLS] [SEP] upon termination, your right to use the service will
immediately cease. [CLS] [SEP]

## limitation of liability

agilebits, inc., its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or
affiliates, shall not be liable for (a) any loss or damage, indirect,
incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without
limitation, economic loss, loss or damage to electronic media or data,
goodwill, or other intangible losses, or (b) for any amount in the aggregate
in excess of the fees actually paid by you in the six (6) months preceding the
event giving rise to your claim, resulting from (i) your access to or use of
the service; (ii) your inability to access or use the service; (iii) any
conduct or content of any third-party on or related to the service; (iv) any
content obtained from or through the service; and (v) the unauthorized access
to, use of or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on
warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other claim in law,
whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and
even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential
purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

## disclaimer and non-waiver of rights

agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind
as regards the website and associated technology. [CLS] [SEP] any purportedly applicable

the service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. [CLS] [SEP] the service is
provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness

entitled to all rights and remedies at any later date, or in any other
situation, where you breach these terms. [CLS] [SEP] agilebits, inc. [CLS] [SEP] does not waive any of

these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## exclusions

as set out, above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] provincial
laws of canada may apply to certain products and service provided. [CLS] [SEP]

## governing law

these terms shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance
with, the laws in the province of ontario and the laws of canada, as

regarding our service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements, oral or
otherwise, regarding the service. [CLS] [SEP]

## dispute resolution

all disputes and questions whatsoever which shall arise between agilebits inc. [CLS] [SEP]
and you in connection with this service agreement, or the construction or
application thereof or any provision contained in this service agreement or as
to any act, deed or omission of any party or as to any other matter in any way
relating to this service agreement, shall be resolved by arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] such
arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement between the parties or, in
default of such agreement, such arbitrator shall be appointed by a judge of
the superior court of justice sitting in toronto, upon the application of any
of the parties and such judge shall be entitled to act as such arbitrator, if
he or she so desires. [CLS] [SEP]

unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, arbitration shall be held in the
city of toronto, province of ontario. [CLS] [SEP] the procedure to be followed shall be
agreed to by the parties or, in default of such agreement, determined by the
arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of
the arbitration act 1991 (ontario). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall have the power to
proceed with the arbitration and to deliver his or her award notwithstanding
the default by any party in respect of any procedural order made by the
arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

the decision arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and no
appeal shall lie therefrom. [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

## changes

we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these terms
at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if a revision is material we will make reasonable efforts to
provide at least 30 daysâ notice prior to any new terms taking effect. [CLS] [SEP] what
constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
