# privacy policy

version identifier: 1.2.1

version effective date: 26/02/2021

##### introduction

this privacy notice sets out how any personal data we collect from you, or
that you provide to us, will be processed by us. [CLS] [SEP] please read the following
carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your sensitive
information and how we will deal with it. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of the data
protection act 2018 ('the dpa') and the eu general data protection regulation
(âthe gdprâ), sensitive information includes what is defined as your
'personal data'. [CLS] [SEP]

by visiting https://www.wigwam.design (the 'website') you accept and consent
to the practices described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in this privacy policy, we seek to abide by the letter and spirit of the
guidelines laid out by the uk information commissionerâs office. [CLS] [SEP] the
guidelines can be found at the following link https://ico.org.uk/for-
organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-
regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/. [CLS] [SEP]

in summary, our approach is to record only the absolute minimum data required
to successfully operate the website. [CLS] [SEP]

##### who we are

we are 'wigwam design' a vat registered company in the united kingdom,
registered number 283391288. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any concerns about the way we use
your information or any questions about this privacy notice, please let us
know. [CLS] [SEP] we can be contacted via email at sam@wigwam.design. [CLS] [SEP]

##### what we do with your information - 'locations served'

our 'locations served' feature requires only the `outward code` part of the
postcode and the rest, or `inward code`, is discarded, if entered. [CLS] [SEP] the
`outward code` part of a uk postcode contains only the area and district
information. [CLS] [SEP] this is the minimum amount of data required to implement the
feature. [CLS] [SEP] this data is processed entirely in the browser and is not persisted
or transmitted outside of it. [CLS] [SEP]

##### what we do with your information - 'gallery'

your searches and tag choices on the gallery are handled entirely on your
device. [CLS] [SEP] the state of your tag selection is only retained for the duration of
your current visit. [CLS] [SEP] as mentioned elsewhere in this policy, this website makes
no attempt to identify individual users and does not track users across
multiple visits to the site. [CLS] [SEP] as such, if your tag choices require the download
of extra images to facilitate your request then there is no mechanism to
relate that request to any kind of user data, as no user identifying data
exists on the system. [CLS] [SEP]

##### what we do with your information - 'contact us'

if you make use of our 'contact us' page we will use the information that you
provide to instigate our initial conversation. [CLS] [SEP] providing your information to
the form on this page indicates you wish for us to make direct contact with
you. [CLS] [SEP] the form only records the data necessary to facilitate this. [CLS] [SEP]

specifically, the form requires:

data| required for  
---|---  
your name| addressing our contact to you personally  
your email| sending our response as soon as we are available  
your message| understanding the intent of your enquiry  
  
the information and content held on our website is deployed geographically,
via a content delivery network (cdn), to increase the loading performance of
the website from the perspective of an individual user. [CLS] [SEP] we will never share
your user information with third parties for promotional purposes. [CLS] [SEP] the
information you supply via our 'contact us' form is not recorded by this
system. [CLS] [SEP]

the data you supply to the form is transmitted to our local system and only
your name and email address are recorded. [CLS] [SEP] this data is retained only for as
long as it is necessary to provide any services that you request or for
regulatory reasons outside the scope of the website. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if we are to
go on and provide services to you, then that data will be retained for as long
as it is required for us to retain records of those transactions. [CLS] [SEP] it is stored
subject to our separate it security policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if we do not provide services to you (or remain in contact for any other valid
reason) then all the data you have supplied is erased. [CLS] [SEP]

should we continue to provide services to you then your data will be retained
for that purpose and that purpose alone and at this point becomes subject to
our client terms and conditions and is outside the scope of the website and
this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### what we do with your information - 'visiting the website'

all requests to the website are handled by our tls endpoint. [CLS] [SEP] requests sent in
the plain are redirected to take place over tls. [CLS] [SEP] in other words, if you were
to try to visit our website via an address beginning with `http://` it would
be automatically redirected to the same address, but over `https`. [CLS] [SEP] only the
currently accepted best practice ciphers are allowed. [CLS] [SEP] the choice of ciphers is
also under continued review and is made for maximum security with the majority
of browsers in use at the time. [CLS] [SEP] this means that a connection to our website
with an old browser that does not support these best practices will be
rejected. [CLS] [SEP] in these circumstances it is likely that the browser will show an
error message that it has been unable to make a secure connection. [CLS] [SEP] it is
suggested to take further external advice about upgrading to a more modern
browser if you still wish to visit the website. [CLS] [SEP]

when you visit the website (a 'request') technical data is recorded to
facilitate the visit. [CLS] [SEP] this includes the internet protocol (ip) address of your
machine and other information such as the browser and type of machine that is
making the request. [CLS] [SEP] this information is obtained from the request sent from
your web browser. [CLS] [SEP] no attempts are made to obtain any further information from
your machine outside of the http protocol. [CLS] [SEP] this data is necessary for the
ongoing operation and maintenance of the system, to enable us to understand
how our website is being used and for later fault finding in the event of an
error or other investigation. [CLS] [SEP]

in summary, only the information that is required to enable the process of
'visiting a website' is recorded. [CLS] [SEP] this data is aggregated and anonymised and
we have no system in place to identify individual users from this information. [CLS] [SEP]
we do not track users across multiple visits to the website and we do not make
use of cookies. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are small text files that are used to store small
amounts of data about a user, such as language settings, between visits to a
website. [CLS] [SEP] every visit to our website is treated as a new request from a new
user. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not provide any of our logs to any third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you are concerned
about giving away this type of technical data then it is suggested to seek out
advice and technology in this domain. [CLS] [SEP] such a discussion is outside the scope
of this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### javascript on this website

javascript, along with html and css is one of the main technologies that
enable this website to function. [CLS] [SEP] when enabled, javascript provides all the
client side dynamic behaviour of the website, including navigating between
pages and loading images. [CLS] [SEP] it is not used to track users or users behaviour. [CLS] [SEP]

##### what we do to ensure the security of your personal information

we treat our information and electronic security with the utmost priority. [CLS] [SEP] as
such our approach to information security is continually reviewed and evolved
to keep ahead of current and emerging risks. [CLS] [SEP]

we have adopted industry best practices from both technological and business
process perspectives in order to make the security of your data a key part of
the way we do business. [CLS] [SEP]

we have policies and practices in place that not only ensure our compliance
under the dpa but also the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

##### your rights regarding your personal information

as described earlier in this policy, data that you supply to the website is
not stored on a system covered by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] the data that is transmitted
from this system (data that you have supplied in out 'contact us' form), is
stored subject to our client terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] a copy of these terms and
conditions is supplied to any user of our core business. [CLS] [SEP]

##### version control

our policies and procedures in relation to maintaining privacy for our users,
as well as security in general, are continually under review. [CLS] [SEP] as such the
wording of this policy is subject to change. [CLS] [SEP] when considering our usage of
your data the version of the policy active at the time of the usage should be
used. [CLS] [SEP] we retain all versions of this policy along with a list of all changes
that are made to it. [CLS] [SEP] in order to verify the authenticity of a given copy of
this policy a sha hash is generated at the time of creation and stored
separately. [CLS] [SEP] subsequent checks can then be made to compare this hash against
the copy of the file in question. [CLS] [SEP]

##### verification of claims made in this policy

all the claims made in this policy can be independently verified by the user
by inspecting the network requests made by the site in the browser network
tools. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to this manual process, many browsers, either via plugin or
as standard, provide a simple user interface for the user to inspect what
level of tracking any given website or service is implementing. [CLS] [SEP] these tools
can be used to confirm the claims made in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
