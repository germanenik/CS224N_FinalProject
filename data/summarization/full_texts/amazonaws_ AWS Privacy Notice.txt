####  how we use personal information

we use your personal information to operate, provide, and improve aws
offerings. [CLS] [SEP] our purposes for using personal information include:

  * **provide aws offerings:** we use your personal information to provide and deliver aws offerings and process transactions related to aws offerings, including registrations, subscriptions, purchases, and payments. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **measure, support, and improve aws offerings:** we use your personal information to measure use of, analyze performance of, fix errors in, provide support for, improve, and develop aws offerings. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **protection of us and others:** we release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of aws, our customers, or others. [CLS] [SEP] this includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction. [CLS] [SEP]
