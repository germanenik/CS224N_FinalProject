  1. [CLS] [SEP] ## information we automatically collect

**categories of information.** we and our third-party service providers
(including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers)
automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when
you interact with the services to help us understand how our users use the
services and to target advertising to you (which we will refer to in this
privacy notice collectively as “usage data”). [CLS] [SEP] for example, each time you visit
the services we and our third-party service providers automatically collect
your location, ip address, mobile device identifier or other unique
identifier, browser and computer type, internet service provider used,
clickstream information, access time, the web page you came from, the url you
go to next, the web page(s) that you access during your visit and your
interaction with content or advertising on the services. [CLS] [SEP] we may contract with
third parties to collect this information on our behalf for analytics
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] these include companies such as chartbeat, comscore and google. [CLS] [SEP]

**purposes for this information.** we and our third-party service providers
use such usage data for a variety of purposes including to diagnose problems
with our servers and software, to administer the services, to gather
demographic information and to target advertising to you on the services and
elsewhere online. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, our third-party advertising networks and ad
servers will also provide us with information, including reports that will
tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the services in a manner
that does not identify personally any specific individual. [CLS] [SEP] the usage data we
collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a
specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] ## cookies/tracking technologies

we use tracking technologies, such as cookies, local storage, and pixel tags. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies and local storage

cookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer. [CLS] [SEP] upon your
first visit to the services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your
computer that uniquely identifies your browser. [CLS] [SEP] “cookies” and local storage
are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your
computer’s browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. [CLS] [SEP] many
major web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users. [CLS] [SEP]
each web site can send its own cookie to your browser. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers are
initially set up to accept cookies. [CLS] [SEP] you can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject
cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the services or take full
advantage of our services. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, if you clear all cookies on your
browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or
indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your
browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. [CLS] [SEP]

read our [cookie policy](/legal/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

our services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out
below:

### cookies and local storage

type of cookie | purpose  
---|---  
analytics and performance cookies | these cookies are used to collect
information about traffic to our services and how users use our services. [CLS] [SEP] the
information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. [CLS] [SEP] the information
is aggregated and therefore anonymous. [CLS] [SEP] it includes the number of visitors to
our services, the websites that referred them to our services, the pages that
they visited on our services, what time of day they visited our services,
whether they have visited our services before, and other similar information. [CLS] [SEP]
we use this information to help operate our services more efficiently, to
gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on
our services. [CLS] [SEP] we use google analytics for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics uses
its own cookies. [CLS] [SEP] it is only used to improve how our services works. [CLS] [SEP] you can
find out more information about google analytics cookies
[here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-
usage). [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more about how google protects your data here. [CLS] [SEP] you
can prevent the use of google analytics relating to your use of our services
by downloading and installing the browser plugin available
[here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-gb). [CLS] [SEP]  
service cookies | these cookies are essential to provide you with services
available through our services and to enable you to use its features. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our services and help the
content of the pages you request load quickly. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, the
services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these
cookies to provide you with those services. [CLS] [SEP]  
functionality cookies | these cookies allow our services to remember choices
you make when you use our services, such as remembering your language
preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have
voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the
changes you make to other parts of our services which you can customize. [CLS] [SEP] the
purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and
to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our
services. [CLS] [SEP]  
social media cookies | these cookies are used when you share information using
a social media sharing button or “like” button on our services or you link
your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking
website such as facebook, twitter, instagram or others. [CLS] [SEP] the social network
will record that you have done this and collect information from you which may
be your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]  
targeted and advertising cookies | these cookies track your browsing habits to
enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]
these cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with
other users who have similar interests. [CLS] [SEP] based on that information, and with
our permission, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to
show ads which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on
third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies also store your location, including your
latitude, longitude, and geoip region id, which helps us show you locale-
specific news and allows our services to operate more efficiently. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
### flash

a flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the adobe flash plug-in
that is built into or downloaded by you onto your device. [CLS] [SEP] flash cookies are
used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a flash
feature and remembering your preferences. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about flash and
the privacy choices adobe offers, visit
[here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). [CLS] [SEP]
if you choose to adjust your flash privacy settings on your device some
features of the services may not function properly. [CLS] [SEP]

### pixel tags

we also use “pixel tags,” which are small graphic files that allow us and
third parties to monitor the use of the services and collect usage data. [CLS] [SEP] a
pixel tag can collect information such as the ip address of the computer that
downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the url of the page on which the
pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel
tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the
identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your
computer. [CLS] [SEP]

we use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers,
service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit,
including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in
connection with our sites and services and use them in combination with our
cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] pixel tags also
enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the
services or other websites. [CLS] [SEP]

### log files

a log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your
use of the service, such as your service use data. [CLS] [SEP]

### device fingerprinting

device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of
information elements from your device’s browser, such as javascript objects
and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and
uniquely identify your device and apps. [CLS] [SEP]

### app technologies, customization, and usage

there are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps
that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and
updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your
unique device identifier (“udid”) and other technical identifiers. [CLS] [SEP] more
specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your
device and your use of our apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you
see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and
items you download. [CLS] [SEP] these tracking technologies are not browser-based like
cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our apps
may include third party sdks, which is code that sends information about your
use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. [CLS] [SEP] these sdks allow
us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you
advertising both on and off the sites, customize the app to your interests and
preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with
additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our site with your
social media account. [CLS] [SEP]

### location-identifying technologies

gps, wifi, bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to
collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through
your device. [CLS] [SEP] location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your
device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and
advertising based on that location. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar
information for security and fraud detection purposes essential to the
operation of our sites and business. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our
site, please review section 13 of this privacy notice and our [cookies and
tracking technologies policy](/legal/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP] you can also find more
information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on
your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them
[here](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and
[here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] ## information you choose to submit

you can visit the services without telling us who you are or revealing any
information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable
individual (which we will refer to in this privacy notice collectively as
“personal data”). [CLS] [SEP] if, however, you wish to register to become a member of the
services, you are required to provide certain personal data (for example, your
name and email address), and you must also provide a username and password. [CLS] [SEP] we
use your personal data to fulfill your requests for products and services, to
improve our services, to contact you from time to time, with your consent,
about us and our products and services, and as otherwise described in this
privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

we refer collectively to all information we collect that is not personal data,
including usage data, demographic data and de-identified personal data, as
“non-personal data”. [CLS] [SEP] if we combine non-personal data with personal data, we
will treat the combined information as personal data under this privacy
notice. [CLS] [SEP]

personal data, non-personal data, and user submissions are referred to in this
privacy notice collectively as “user information.”

you may choose to enter contests, sweepstakes, competitions, participate in
surveys, subscribe to newsletters, comment articles, use message boards, chat
rooms, reader photo upload areas, reader ratings and reviews, save articles or
other content on our sites, reader-created content upload areas, contact us
and customer support areas, and areas that allow you to register for sms text
messaging and mobile alerts, or otherwise interact with us in similar ways
(“interactive areas”). [CLS] [SEP] these interactive areas may require that you provide
personal data corresponding with the activities. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that
the interactive areas are voluntary and that your providing personal data for
those activities will be collected and used by us to identify and communicate
with you. [CLS] [SEP] in certain circumstances, we may share that personal information
with sponsors, advertisers, affiliates or other partners. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
questions about a specific interactive area, please contact us and reference
that specific interactive area. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, you are required to provide certain personal data when you submit
a job application and supporting materials. [CLS] [SEP] where you submit a job application
on behalf of another person, you confirm that you have made that person aware
of how we collect, use and share their personal data, the reason you have
provided it, how they can contact us, the terms of this privacy notice and
related policies and that they have consented to such collection, use and
sharing. [CLS] [SEP] you can also choose to submit or we may collect additional
information about yourself, such as demographic information (for example your
gender, birth date, or zip code) and information about your preferences and
interests. [CLS] [SEP] failure to provide any required personal data will prevent us from
being able to provide the services you request (e.g., member registration or
submission of job application) or otherwise inhibit our ability to provide the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

here are examples of user information we may collect:

    * **contact data.** we collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **credentials.** we collect passwords, password hints, and other information for authentication and account access. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **payment data.** we collect data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **profile data.** we collect your username, interests, favorites, and other profile data. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **contacts.** we collect data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you, such as fulfilling a gift subscription. [CLS] [SEP] such functionality is only intended for united states (“u.s.”) residents. [CLS] [SEP] by using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **content.** we collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the services you use. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **resume data.** we collect data to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, including your employment history, writing samples, and references. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **survey data.** we may also survey visitors about various topics, including events and experiences, media consumption preferences and how we can improve our sites and services. [CLS] [SEP] response to our surveys is entirely voluntary. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **public postings.** we collect information when you submit something to be displayed on our sites. [CLS] [SEP] any communication you submit or that may be posted to a publicly viewable area of our sites, such as a comment on an article or a review, is a public communication and may be viewed by the general public. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to such areas via our sites, whether or not your submission includes personal information. [CLS] [SEP] these submissions would include newsletter sign-ups and any area of our site that requires a login or registration prior to use. [CLS] [SEP] if at any time you display your personal information in any communication submitted to such areas, other individuals may collect and use your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any personal information you disclose in a communication submitted to such areas for posting or contained in an email or other communication submitted to us for such posting, and thus, you acknowledge that if you disclose personal information in any such material, you do so at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] ## information we receive from other sources

we may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to
learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we show
you, and for other purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we may receive this information about you from
public sources or third parties, including without limitation consumer data
resellers, social networks, and advertisers that demonstrate collection
complaint with applicable privacy laws. [CLS] [SEP] we may combine the information we
receive from those other sources with information we collect through the
services. [CLS] [SEP] in those cases, we will apply this privacy notice to the combined
information. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] ## information use

we use the information we collect, including personal data and usage data:

    * to enable you to use our services, to create an account or profile, to process information you provide via our services (including verifying that your email address is active and valid) and to process your transactions;
    * to provide related customer service and care, including responding to your questions, complaints, or comments and sending surveys and processing survey responses;
    * to provide you with information, products, or services that you have requested;
    * to offer sms text message mobile alerts for specific purposes;

    * to receive and process job applications for jobs with us;
    * to provide you with information, products, or services that we otherwise believe will interest you, including special opportunities from us and our third-party partners;
    * to tailor content, recommendations, and advertisements we and third parties display to you, both on the services and elsewhere online;
    * for internal business purposes, such as to improve our services and content;
    * to administer and process contests, sweepstakes, promotions, conferences and special events (collectively “events”). [CLS] [SEP] information collected through our sites in conjunction with such events is also used for marketing additional products, services and events by us and/or by our advertisers, sponsors, and marketing partners. [CLS] [SEP] please see the rules of each individual event and any applicable privacy policies for those events for additional information on the choices you may exercise with respect to the use of your personal information collected in connection with that event. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent there is a conflict between this privacy notice and the rules or policies applicable to an event, the rules and policies associated with the event shall govern.;
    * to contact you with administrative communications and, in our discretion, changes to our privacy notice, terms of use, or any of our other policies;
    * to comply with regulatory and legal obligations; and
    * for purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as further described in this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] ## social network and platform integration

the services contain integration with social networks and other platforms in
which information is shared between us and such platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you
create or log into your account through a third-party social media site, we
may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name,
email address, account information, photo and friends lists, and other
information in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such
social media site. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t want a social network to collect the
information about you as described above, or you don’t want a social network
to share it with us, please review the privacy policy, privacy settings and
instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

  7. [CLS] [SEP] ## our information sharing practice

### generally

we share non-personal data, including usage data, de-identified personal data
and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
information collected via the sites is shared among our affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we may share your information with our related entities including our
parent and sister companies for customer support, marketing, and technical
operations. [CLS] [SEP] we share user information, including personal data, as otherwise
described in this policy, and under the following circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

### service providers

from time to time, we enter into relationships with third parties who provide
services to us (for example, analytics and research companies, advertisers and
ad agencies, data management and storage services, credit card processing
services, merchandise sales facilitators, sweepstakes or contest prize
fulfillment). [CLS] [SEP] we share your information with third parties for the purposes of
facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with
a social network about your activities on the sites) and in connection with
tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our sites and advertising
effectiveness, and other enabling enhancements. [CLS] [SEP] we share aggregate information
about our visitors with our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners,
such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average
age of our visitors on the site(s) or page(s), or the likes and dislikes of
our visitors, but this information is not specific to any individual visitor. [CLS] [SEP]
we obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other
sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal the precise location
of a specific visitor. [CLS] [SEP] we also obtain other demographic information from third
parties to improve our products and services, for marketing purposes or to
display more relevant advertising. [CLS] [SEP] in those circumstances, we disclose user
information so that such service providers perform those services. [CLS] [SEP] these
service providers are only permitted to use your personal data to the extent
necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. [CLS] [SEP] they are required to
follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security
measures to protect your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] and our sites use certain google
analytics and other services, and certain pages use the google amp client id
api, each of which enable collection and sharing of your information
(including personal data) with google for further use. [CLS] [SEP] for specific
information on google usage and how to control it, please see how google uses
data when you use our partners’ sites or apps and google’s privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

### operational providers

for your convenience, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain
goods, merchandise and services through the sites (including, without
limitation, retail purchases, print and digital magazine subscriptions and
special event tickets). [CLS] [SEP] companies other than vox media, inc., its parents,
partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may process these transactions. [CLS] [SEP] we call
these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order and contest
fulfillment and/or contract services “operational providers.” they are third
parties that perform services on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to use these
optional services, our operational providers will request your personal
information to fulfill your order or request. [CLS] [SEP] the voluntary submission of your
personal information to these operational providers, including your order or
request, will be governed by the specific provider’s terms of use and privacy
policies. [CLS] [SEP] to facilitate an order or request from you, we may share your
personal information with the provider. [CLS] [SEP] the operational provider may also
share your personal information and information about your purchases with us. [CLS] [SEP]
we may store this information in our membership database. [CLS] [SEP] in most instances,
we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in our
privacy notice and that such providers only share visitors’ personal
information with us, unless necessary to complete a visitor’s request or
order. [CLS] [SEP] operational providers are only permitted to use any personal
information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling your
requested service or order. [CLS] [SEP] however, you must read an operational provider’s
privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal
information collected online. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the collection, use
and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor are we responsible or
liable for their services. [CLS] [SEP]

### events

our events and promotions may be jointly managed, sponsored or offered by
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you voluntarily choose to enter or attend an event, we may
share your information with third parties as set forth in the official rules
that govern the event as well as for administrative purposes and as required
by law (e.g., on a winners list). [CLS] [SEP] by entering a contest or sweepstakes event,
you agree to the official rules that govern that event, and may, except where
prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use
your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. [CLS] [SEP] some
events may be managed wholly by a third party and will be governed by any
rules or terms they provide for that event and it is your responsibility to
review and comply with those terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### third-party direct marketing

we may share your information with third parties for our own direct marketing
purposes (for example, email blasts, special offers, discounts, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] if you
have not opted out of us sharing your information with third parties for
marketing purposes, we may also share your information (including personal
data) with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] please note,
messages delivered from a third-party will subject you to the third-party’s
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we may also match your email address with third parties and
use such match to deliver custom offers or emails to you on the services and
off the services. [CLS] [SEP]

### third party features

we may allow you to connect our sites to a third party service or offer our
sites through a third party service (“third party features”). [CLS] [SEP] if you use a
third party feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to
and use information associated with your use of the third party feature, and
you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. [CLS] [SEP]
some examples of third party features include the following:

**logging-in.** you may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your
profile on the sites through the facebook login feature. [CLS] [SEP] by doing this, you
are asking facebook to send us certain information from your facebook profile,
and you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this
privacy notice any and all information available to us through the facebook
interface. [CLS] [SEP]

**brand pages.** we offer our content on social networks such as a facebook,
twitter, and instagram. [CLS] [SEP] any information you provide to us when you engage with
our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with
this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP] also, if you publicly reference our sites on a third
party service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or
post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our service. [CLS] [SEP]

### change of control

in the event we go through a business transition (such as a merger,
acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our
assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence
process), your personal data will likely be among the assets transferred. [CLS] [SEP] by
providing your personal data, you agree that we can transfer such information
in those circumstances without your further consent. [CLS] [SEP] should such a business
transition occur, we will make reasonable efforts to request that the new
owner or combined entity (as applicable) follow this privacy notice with
respect to your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] if your personal data would be used contrary to
this privacy notice, we will request that you receive prior notice. [CLS] [SEP]

### other disclosure scenarios

we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share user
information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or
to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
claims; (ii) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent,
or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving
potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (iii) if we believe
it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant
abuse of the services infrastructure or the internet in general (such as
voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the
security of information); (iv) to protect and defend our legal rights or
property, our services or their users, or any other party, and to protect the
health and safety of our users or the general public; and (v) to our parent
company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control
with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this privacy
notice). [CLS] [SEP]

  8. [CLS] [SEP] ## anonymous data

when we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and
information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either
alone or when combined with any other information available to a third-party. [CLS] [SEP]
we may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and
other individuals whose personal data we collect. [CLS] [SEP] anonymous data will include
analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. [CLS] [SEP] we make
personal data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name
or other personal identifiers) that makes the data personally identifiable to
you. [CLS] [SEP] we use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make
improvements to our services. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] ## public information

if you identify any user information as public, you are authorizing us to
share such information publicly. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can elect to make certain of
your user submissions (such as your alias, bio, email or photos) publicly
available. [CLS] [SEP] also, there are areas of the services (for example, message boards,
discussion rooms, and other online forums) in which you are able to post
information that automatically will be available to all other users of the
services. [CLS] [SEP] by choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone
can access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas. [CLS] [SEP]

  10. [CLS] [SEP] ## users outside of the united states and consent to transfer

the services are operated in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] if you are located in another
jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us will be
transferred to, stored and processed in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] by using the
services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer,
processing, and storage of your information in the united states, a
jurisdiction in which the privacy laws are not as comprehensive as those in
the country where you reside or are a citizen such as the european union. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand that the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government can obtain access to the personal data you
submit if necessary for investigative purposes (e.g., terrorism
investigation). [CLS] [SEP] we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that
your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP] we
use appropriate and suitable safeguards for transferring your personal data to
the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] (e.g., standard contractual clauses issued by the european
commission, which can be accessed [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-
topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-
personal-data-third-countries_en)). [CLS] [SEP]

  11. [CLS] [SEP] ## important information for california residents: your california privacy rights

these additional disclosures for california residents apply only to
individuals who reside in california. [CLS] [SEP] the california consumer privacy act of
2018 (“ccpa”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and
requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide
notices and means to exercise those rights. [CLS] [SEP] the words used in this section
have the meanings given to them in the ccpa, which may be broader than their
common meaning. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the definition of “personal information” under
the ccpa includes your name, but also more general information such as age. [CLS] [SEP]

### notice of collection

although the information we collect is described in greater detail in sections
1-6 above, the categories of personal information that we may have collected –
as described by the ccpa – in the past 12 months are:

    * identifiers, including name, email address, phone number account name, ip address, and an id or number assigned to your account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * customer records, billing and shipping address, and credit or debit card information. [CLS] [SEP]
    * demographics, such as your age or gender. [CLS] [SEP] this category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other california or federal laws. [CLS] [SEP]
    * commercial information, including purchases and engagement with the services. [CLS] [SEP]
    * internet activity, including your interactions with our service. [CLS] [SEP]
    * audio or visual data, including pictures or videos you post on our service. [CLS] [SEP]
    * geolocation data, including location enabled services such as wifi and gps. [CLS] [SEP]
    * employment and education data, including information you provide when you apply for a job with us. [CLS] [SEP]
    * inferences, including information about your interests, preferences and favorites. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information on our collection practices, including the sources we
receive information from, please review the different forms of information
collected through various means as described in more detail in sections 1 – 6
above. [CLS] [SEP] we collect and use these categories of personal information for the
business purposes also described in sections 1 – 6, as well as our sharing
practices described in section 7. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not generally “sell” personal information as the term “sell” is
traditionally understood. [CLS] [SEP] however, to the extent “sale” under the ccpa is
interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those
disclosed in the advertising (section 13) as a “sale,” we provide you the
option to request that we not “sell” your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we do not sell
the personal information of minors known to be under the age of 16 without
affirmative authorization. [CLS] [SEP]

we sell or disclose the following categories of personal information for
commercial purposes: identifiers, demographic information, commercial
information, internet activity, geolocation data and inferences. [CLS] [SEP] we use and
partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations
and manage our service. [CLS] [SEP] please review our information sharing practices in
section 7 above, advertising in section 7 below, and our [cookies and tracking
technologies policy](/legal/cookie-policy) for more detail about the parties
we have shared information with. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to know and delete

if you are a california resident, you have the right to delete the personal
information we have collected from you and the right to know certain
information about our data practices in the preceding 12 months. [CLS] [SEP] in
particular, you have the right to request the following from us:

    * the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
    * the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
    * the categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
    * the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
    * the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and
    * the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. [CLS] [SEP]

to exercise any of these rights, please [submit a request through our online
form](/contact) or email us at
[vmprivacy@voxmedia.com](mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com). [CLS] [SEP] in the request,
please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the
request. [CLS] [SEP] we will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. [CLS] [SEP]

we have a duty as the holder of certain personal information to verify your
identity when making requests to know or delete personal information and to
ensure that dissemination of that information would not cause harm to you if
it were distributed to another person. [CLS] [SEP] to verify your identity, we will
request and collect additional personal information from you to match it
against our records. [CLS] [SEP] we may ask for additional information or documentation if
we feel it is necessary to confirm your identity with the necessary degree of
certainty. [CLS] [SEP] we may communicate with you through email, a secure message center,
or other reasonably necessary and appropriate means. [CLS] [SEP] we do have the right to
deny requests under certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, we will notify you
of the reasons for denial. [CLS] [SEP] we will not provide you with specific pieces of
personal information if the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable, and
unreasonable risk to the security of that personal information, your account
with us, or the security of our systems or networks. [CLS] [SEP] in no event will we
disclose, if we have collected it, your social security number, driver’s
license number or other government-issued identification number, financial
account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an
account password, or security questions and answers. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to opt-out

to the extent we sell your personal information as the term “sell” is defined
under the california consumer privacy act, you have the right to opt-out of
the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time. [CLS] [SEP] you
may submit a request to opt-out of by clicking do not sell my personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] you may also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at
[vmprivacy@voxmedia.com](mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com). [CLS] [SEP]

### authorized agent

you may submit a request through a designated agent. [CLS] [SEP] you must instruct that
agent that they will need to state that they are acting on your behalf when
making the request, have reasonably necessary documentation, and be prepared
to provide the necessary personal information to identify you in our database. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to non-discrimination

you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the
exercise of any your rights. [CLS] [SEP]

### financial incentives

financial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including
payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale
of personal information about them. [CLS] [SEP]

we may offer discounted prices to consumers who sign up to be on our mailing
lists or join our loyalty programs. [CLS] [SEP] such programs will have additional terms
that require your review and agreement. [CLS] [SEP] please review those terms for the
details of those programs, how to withdraw or cancel, or to assert your rights
specific to those programs. [CLS] [SEP]

we generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under
california law. [CLS] [SEP] however, in certain circumstances, discounted prices will
require you to be on our mailing list or a member of our loyalty program. [CLS] [SEP] in
such circumstances, we may offer a price difference because the price is
reasonably related to the value of your data. [CLS] [SEP] the value of your data will be
explained in the terms of such incentivized programs. [CLS] [SEP]

### shine the light

california’s “shine the light” law permits customers in california to request
certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with
third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and
affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] under the law, a business should
either provide california customers certain information upon request or permit
california customers to opt out of this type of sharing. [CLS] [SEP]

to exercise a shine the light request, please contact us at
[vmprivacy@voxmedia.com](mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com) or vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] c/o
legal department , vox media inc., 1201 connecticut ave. [CLS] [SEP] nw, 11th floor,
washington, dc 20036. [CLS] [SEP] you must put the statement “your california privacy
rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address,
city, state, and zip code. [CLS] [SEP] in the body of your request, please provide enough
information for us to determine if this applies to you. [CLS] [SEP] please note that we
will not accept inquiries via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we
are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, or
that do not have complete information. [CLS] [SEP]

### important information for nevada residents-your nevada privacy rights

if you are a resident of nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of
certain personal data to third parties who intend to license or sell that
personal data. [CLS] [SEP] you can exercise this right by contacting us [here](/contact)
or email us at [vmprivacy@voxmedia.com](mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com) with
the subject line “nevada do not sell request” and providing us with your name
and the email address associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]

  12. [CLS] [SEP] ## how we respond to “do not track” signals

internet browsers can be configured to send “do not track” signals to the
online services that you visit. [CLS] [SEP] california business & professions code section
22575(b) (as amended effective january 1, 2014) provides that california
residents are entitled to know how vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] responds to “do not track”
browser settings. [CLS] [SEP]

there currently is no consensus among industry participants as to what “do not
track” means in this context. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, like many websites and online
services, the services do not alter their practices when they receive a “do
not track” signal from a visitor’s browser. [CLS] [SEP] to find out more about “do not
track,” please visit [here](https://allaboutdnt.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

  13. [CLS] [SEP] ## advertising

### generally

we use other companies under agreements with us to serve third-party
advertisements when you visit and use the services. [CLS] [SEP] these companies collect
and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of
advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to the services and
other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
likely to be of greater interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] these companies typically use
tracking technologies to collect this information. [CLS] [SEP] other companies’ use of
their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this
one. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we share with these third parties any personal information
you voluntarily provide, such as an email address, in response to an
advertisement or sponsored content link. [CLS] [SEP]

### targeted advertising

in order to serve offers and advertisements that may be of interest to our
users, we display targeted advertisements on the services, or other digital
properties or applications in conjunction with our content, based on
information provided to us by our users and information provided to us by
third parties that they have independently collected. [CLS] [SEP]

### your ad choices

some of the third-party services providers and/or advertisers may be members
of the network advertising initiative (“nai”) or the digital advertising
alliance (“daa”) self-regulatory program for online behavioral advertising. [CLS] [SEP]
you can visit [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp),
which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out”
procedures of nai members. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt-out of the use of your behavioral data
used by daa members to serve you interest-based advertising on third-party
sites [here](https://www.aboutads.info/choices). [CLS] [SEP]

if you are accessing the services through an application (i.e., mobile phone
or tablet) you can download the appchoices application from your device’s
application store (i.e., google play, apple app store, and amazon store). [CLS] [SEP] this
daa application allows participating companies to offer an opt-out of
customized advertisements that are based on predictions about your interests
generated from your application usage. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, visit
[here](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices). [CLS] [SEP]

please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being
served advertising. [CLS] [SEP] you will continue to receive generic ads while online or
on your device. [CLS] [SEP]

### mobile

we may from time to time offer certain location or pinpoint based services,
such as location assisted navigation instruction. [CLS] [SEP] if you elect to use such
location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order
to provide such location-based services to you. [CLS] [SEP] by using the location-based
services, you authorize us to: (i) locate your hardware; (ii) record, compile
and display your location; and (iii) publish your location to third parties
designated by you by means of location publication controls available within
the applications (for example, settings, user preferences). [CLS] [SEP] as part of the
location-based services, we also collect and store certain information about
the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device id. [CLS] [SEP]
this information will be used to provide you the location-based services. [CLS] [SEP] we
use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through
mobile systems (unless you opt out of such location-based services with such
providers) and we provide the information to such providers to enable them to
provide their location-based services, provided that such providers use the
information in accordance with our privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

  14. [CLS] [SEP] ## choice/opt-out from communications

we offer you the opportunity to manage your communications from us. [CLS] [SEP] even after
subscribing to one or more newsletters and/or opting in to one or more offers
to receive marketing and/or promotional communications from us or our third-
party partners, users may elect to modify their preferences by following the
“communications preferences” and/or “unsubscribe” link provided in an email or
communication received. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to change your preferences by
updating your profile or account, depending on which of our services you are
using. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that if you wish to remove yourself from a newsletter
and/or other marketing emails from third parties that you consented to through
the services, you must do so by contacting the relevant third-party. [CLS] [SEP] even if
you do opt-out of marketing emails, we reserve the right to send you
transactional and administrative emails including those related to the
services, service announcements, notices of changes to this privacy notice or
other services policies, and to contact you regarding any goods or services
you have ordered. [CLS] [SEP]

  15. [CLS] [SEP] ## retaining, modifying and deleting your personal data

you may request access to the information you have provided to us. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish
to make a request, please contact us using the details in the contact us

not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such
information. [CLS] [SEP] we will comply with your request as soon as reasonably
practicable. [CLS] [SEP] also, please note that we will maintain personal data in our
database whenever we are required to do so by law, for necessary operational
reasons, or to maintain uniform business practices. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that we need to retain certain information for recordkeeping
purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to
requesting such change or deletion (for example, when you enter a promotion,
you may not be able to change or delete the personal data provided until after
the completion of such promotion). [CLS] [SEP] we will retain your personal data for the
period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a
longer retention period is required or permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

will collect your information in accordance with this privacy notice based on
your affirmative informed consent, which you may withdraw at any time through
the methods provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] if you have not accepted, then we only collect
your personal data based on our legitimate interests. [CLS] [SEP]

  17. [CLS] [SEP] ## security

we have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and
organizational security measures to help protect your personal data from
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized
access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the
internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, while we strive to
protect your user information, we cannot guarantee its security. [CLS] [SEP] you use the
services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
(for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us
has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by
contacting us using the details in the contact us section below. [CLS] [SEP]

  18. [CLS] [SEP] ## links

the services contain links to other websites that we do not control, and the
services contain videos, advertising and other content hosted and served by
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-
party. [CLS] [SEP] we may also integrate with third parties who will interact with you
under their terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] one such third party is youtube. [CLS] [SEP] we use youtube
api services and by using the sites or services, you agree to be bound by the
youtube terms of service located [here](http://www.youtube.com/t/terms). [CLS] [SEP]

  19. [CLS] [SEP] ## children’s privacy

the services are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and
should not be used by children under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] we do not knowingly
collect information from children under the age of 16 and we do not target the
services to children under the age of 16. [CLS] [SEP] if a parent or guardian becomes
aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their
consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the contact us
section below. [CLS] [SEP] we will delete such information from our files as soon as
reasonably practicable. [CLS] [SEP]

  20. [CLS] [SEP] ## sensitive personal data

subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not
disclose, any sensitive personal data as this term is defined under applicable
data protection and privacy laws (for example, social security numbers,
information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion
or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal
background or trade union membership) on or through the services or otherwise
to us. [CLS] [SEP]

if you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us or the public

be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised privacy notice unless
otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the services after the effective

your consent, use your personal data in a manner materially different than
what was stated at the time your personal data was collected. [CLS] [SEP]
