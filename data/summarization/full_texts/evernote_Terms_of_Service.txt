welcome to evernote! we invite you to access our websites and use the evernote
service, but please note that your invitation is subject to your agreement
with these terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] this document describes in detail your rights and
our rights relating to the provision of the service (as defined below), so
please review these terms carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

### what are the terms of service?

the terms of service constitutes a contract between evernote and you. [CLS] [SEP] the
terms include the provisions set forth in this document and in the evernote
[privacy policy](/privacy/policy), [commercial terms](/legal/commercial-
terms), [evernote busines­­s agreement](/legal/business), [user
guidelines](/legal/user-guidelines), [ip compliance program](/legal/ip-
compliance) and other terms or conditions that may be presented by us and
accepted by you from time to time in connection with specific service
offerings (all of which we collectively refer to as the “terms of service” or
“terms”). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to these terms, you do not have the right to
access or use our service. [CLS] [SEP] if you do register for or otherwise use our service
you shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of the terms and your agreement
to be a party to this binding contract. [CLS] [SEP]

by using the service, you acknowledge, accept and agree with all provisions of
the privacy policy, including, without limitation, the use and treatment of
the text, images, and other data you choose to input, upload, or store in
evernote (collectively, “content”) and your personal information in accordance
with such privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### what is the evernote service?

the evernote software (as defined below), the evernote service, and other
products, services and websites hosted or made available by evernote,
including, for example our app center, user forum, and help & learning pages
are collectively referred to in these terms as the “service”. [CLS] [SEP] in exchange for
being enabled to use the service, you agree to abide by these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### if this is a contract, who are the parties?

you, the account holder, are one party to this contract. [CLS] [SEP] (an account holder is
the person or entity who has contracted with evernote as either an individual
basic, plus, or premium user or as a customer as defined in our evernote
business agreement.)

if you reside in the united states or canada, then the other party to this
contract is evernote corporation, a corporation headquartered in california. [CLS] [SEP]
if you reside in brazil, then the other party to this contract is evernote do
brasil serviços de aplicações ltda., a company headquartered in the city of
são paulo, state of sao paolo, brazil (“evernote brasil”). [CLS] [SEP] if you reside
outside of the united states, canada and brazil, then the other party to this
contract is evernote gmbh, a company headquartered in zurich, switzerland. [CLS] [SEP]
(evernote corporation, evernote gmbh and evernote brasil, as applicable, may
be referred to in these terms of service as “evernote,” “we” and sometimes
“us”). [CLS] [SEP]

on some occasions, you may be purchasing products or service subscriptions
from an authorized reseller. [CLS] [SEP] please review our [commercial
terms](/legal/commercial-terms) for information about additional contract
terms relating to such purchases. [CLS] [SEP]

### is this the only contract i have with evernote?

it depends upon how you interact with the evernote service and our software
applications. [CLS] [SEP] if you install any evernote software on your computing devices,
you may be asked to agree to an end user license agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you pay for an
evernote subscription, you will be asked to agree to the [commercial
terms](/legal/commercial-terms). [CLS] [SEP] if you use related evernote products or
services (such as evernote business) or participate in our user forum, you may
also need to enter into a separate agreement with us (usually by clicking
“accept” or “agree”). [CLS] [SEP] we refer to each of these as a “separate agreement.” if
that happens, the separate agreement shall take precedence if there is a
conflict between those terms and this terms of service document, to the extent
of such conflict and with respect to the particular subject matter of that
separate agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

### will these terms of service ever change?

these terms may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements
arise, so please check back from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we make a significant
change, we’ll notify you and, where required, seek your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

if we do update these terms, you are free to decide whether to accept the
updated terms or to stop using our service (see “how is my account closed”
below); your continued use of the service after the effectiveness of that
update will be deemed to represent your agreement with, and consent to be
bound by, the new terms. [CLS] [SEP] except for changes made by us as described here, no
other amendment or modification of these terms shall be effective unless set
forth in a written agreement expressly amending these terms and bearing a
written signature by you and us. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, email or other communications
will not constitute an effective written agreement for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

### what do i have to do to use the evernote service?

first, you need to create an evernote service account. [CLS] [SEP] you create an account
by providing us with an email address and creating a password. [CLS] [SEP] (some older
accounts also required a username.) we refer to this as your “basic subscriber
information”. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to use a distinct and non-obvious password that
is different from passwords you use for any other service. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible
for maintaining the accuracy, completeness and confidentiality of your basic
subscriber information, and you will be responsible for all activities that
occur under your account, including activities of others to whom you have
provided your basic subscriber information. [CLS] [SEP] we will not be liable for any loss
or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or
to keep your basic subscriber information secure. [CLS] [SEP] if you discover any
unauthorized use of your basic subscriber information or suspect that anyone
may be able to access your private content without authorization, you should
immediately change your password and notify our customer support team. [CLS] [SEP]

second, you will need to access your account through a web browser or by
installing our client software on your computers, tablets and phones. [CLS] [SEP]
obtaining those devices and paying for their connectivity and data plans is
your responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] evernote also has no responsibility for the availability
of the internet and other telecommunication services necessary to access the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

### can i share my account with someone else?

evernote service accounts should not be shared. [CLS] [SEP] if you share your basic
subscriber information with anyone, that other person may be able to take
control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is the proper
account holder. [CLS] [SEP] we will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share
your basic subscriber information with) as a result of your or their actions
under those circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] since you may use a free evernote service account,
and since we provide a number of mechanisms to allow you to share your account
content with others, we strongly urge you not to share your information with
anyone, unless you are doing so as part of your estate planning purposes, as
discussed below. [CLS] [SEP]

### once i have an account, what are my rights in the evernote service?

once your account is created and you accept these terms, we grant you a
limited, non-exclusive license to use the service subject to these terms, for
so long as you are not barred from receiving the service under the laws
applicable to you, until you close your account voluntarily or until we close
your account pursuant to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we grant you a personal,
worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the
evernote software provided to you by or on behalf of evernote, for the sole
purpose of enabling you to use the evernote software and enjoy the benefit of
the service, subject to any applicable license terms provided with the
evernote software and these terms, until your rights are terminated in
accordance with such license and/or these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you do not obtain any other
right or interest in evernote or the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### evernote’s data protection laws say my data is mine – what does that mean?

you retain copyright and any other rights you already held in your content
before you submitted, posted or displayed it on or through the service. [CLS] [SEP] but
you do have to grant evernote a limited license, as described below, so we can
make your data accessible and usable on the service. [CLS] [SEP] other than this limited
license and other rights you grant in these terms, evernote acknowledges and
agrees that we do not obtain any right, title or interest from you under these
terms in any of your content. [CLS] [SEP]

### what is the license i have to grant to evernote?

in order to enable evernote to operate the service, we must obtain from you
certain limited license rights to process your content that is covered by
intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating
the service are not considered legal violations. [CLS] [SEP] for example, copyright laws
could prevent us from processing, maintaining, storing, backing-up and
distributing certain content, unless you give us these rights. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, by
using the service and uploading content, you are granting evernote a license
to display, perform and distribute your content and to modify (for technical
purposes, e.g., making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as
computers and other devices) and reproduce such content to enable evernote to
operate the service. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that evernote has the right to elect not
to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any content in our sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free, transferable, sub-
licensable, worldwide and irrevocable (for so long as your content is stored
with us), and include a right for evernote to make such content available to,
and pass these rights along to, others with whom evernote has contractual
relationships related to the provision of the service, solely for the purpose
of providing such services, and to otherwise permit access to or disclose your
content to third parties if evernote determines such access is necessary to
comply with its legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

if you elect to use any third party service or application that is integrated
with evernote, you also agree that the licenses granted to evernote in the
preceding paragraph shall apply to content that is submitted or uploaded
through such third party service or application. [CLS] [SEP] if the third party service or
application you elect to use would access or extract content, you grant
evernote the right and license to enable third party access to and extraction
of your content. [CLS] [SEP] evernote does not assume any responsibility for, or liability
on account of, the actions or omissions of such third party applications or
service providers. [CLS] [SEP]

as we rely upon your rights to upload and distribute your content, you
represent and warrant to evernote that (1) you have the unfettered legal
rights and authority to submit your content to evernote, to make any other
use, publication or other distribution of that content in your use of the
service, and to grant the rights granted to evernote under these terms; and
(2) your content complies with our user guidelines and these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

finally, you understand and agree that evernote, in performing the required
technical steps to provide the service to our users, may make such changes to
your content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the
technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media. [CLS] [SEP]

### what other assurances do i have to grant to evernote?

when you use the evernote service to send messages to an email address, to a
telephone number via sms, or through a social media account (e.g., facebook or
linkedin) that has not been linked to an evernote account, evernote sends such
messages on your behalf, and we are relying on your representation to us that
you have a direct relationship with the recipient(s) and that you are
respecting the legal rights of the recipient(s) not to receive certain kinds
of messages (such as harassing messages, unsolicited commercial messages, and
unwanted sms messages). [CLS] [SEP] whenever you send any kind of message to a third party
you represent and warrant to evernote that you are acting within the law and
that you have prior consent from the recipient to send them such a message. [CLS] [SEP]

### are there rules about what i can do on the evernote service?

yes. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the service must be in accordance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP] when it
comes to your use of the service, you agree that you are responsible for your
own conduct and all conduct under your account. [CLS] [SEP] this means all content
created, transmitted, stored or displayed in your account, is your sole
responsibility as the person who created the content or introduced it into the
service. [CLS] [SEP] this applies whether the content is kept private, shared or
transmitted using the service or any third-party application or services
integrated with the evernote service. [CLS] [SEP] [our user guidelines](/legal/user-
guidelines) provide more specific details regarding prohibited conduct on the
service. [CLS] [SEP] if we find that any shared content in your account violates our terms
of service (including by violating another person’s intellectual property or
privacy rights), we reserve the right to un-share or take down such content. [CLS] [SEP]

### i’m guessing evernote has some rights relating to the service?

we do. [CLS] [SEP] they’re described here:

content rights. [CLS] [SEP]

while you own the content you store within the evernote service (subject to
third party rights), you acknowledge and agree that evernote (and our
licensors) own(s) all legal right, title and interest in and to the service,
including, without limitation, all software that is part of the service and
all evernote software deployed by you or a third party to enable capturing of
content originating outside the service, such as evernote scannable, evernote
web clipper, the site memory widget or any of the evernote software
applications for compatible computing devices that enable access and use of
the service through such device (the “evernote software”). [CLS] [SEP]

intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

in agreeing to these terms, you also agree that the rights in the service and
evernote software, including all intellectual property rights, such as
trademarks, patents, designs and copyrights, are protected by one or more of
copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and
treaties, in addition to these terms and any separate agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in
particular, you agree to not modify, create derivative works of, decompile or
otherwise attempt to extract source code from any evernote software, unless
you are expressly permitted to do so under an open source license, we give you
express written permission or you are otherwise legally permitted to do so
notwithstanding this prohibition. [CLS] [SEP]

right to modify the service. [CLS] [SEP]

we retain the right, in our sole discretion, to implement new elements as part
of and/or ancillary to the service, including changes that may affect the
previous mode of operation of the service or evernote software. [CLS] [SEP] we expect that
any such modifications will enhance the overall service, but it is possible
that you may not agree with us. [CLS] [SEP] we also reserve the right to establish limits
to the nature or size of storage available to you, the number of
transmissions, the ability to send or receive email messages, the nature or
size of any index or library information, the nature of, or your continued
ability to access or distribute, your content and other data, and impose other
limitations at any time, with or without notice. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you use
evernote basic, you will not enjoy all of the benefits provided to subscribers
of evernote plus, evernote premium or evernote business. [CLS] [SEP]

you also acknowledge that a variety of evernote actions may impair or prevent
you from accessing your content or using the service at certain times and/or
in the same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that evernote
has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results,
including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make
available to you, any content. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we shall not be liable to you or
to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any
part of the service. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you are a subscriber for evernote plus,
evernote premium, evernote business or another paid version of the service
(each a “paid service”) and find that any such modifications or interruption
of the paid service adversely affects you, you may notify our customer support
team, explain the adverse impact the modification has created and, if you
desire, request a termination of your paid service. [CLS] [SEP] upon receipt of any such
request, we will endeavor to promptly remedy the adverse impact caused by the
modification, extend the duration of your paid service subscription for a
period of time equal to the interruption and/or refund a portion of your paid
service subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the paid
service subscription, as we determine appropriate or as may be required by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

right to engage third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

evernote engages certain affiliates or other third parties (“service
providers”) to provide technical or other services relating to all or part of
the service, and you hereby agree that such involvement by these service
providers is acceptable. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, evernote may contract with third party
resellers of the evernote plus, premium or business versions of the service
and payment processors to enable payments in your local currency and payment
systems. [CLS] [SEP] please see our privacy policy to understand the extent to which any
affiliate or third party may have access to your account information or
content and our [commercial terms](/legal/commercial-terms) to understand our
relationship with any reseller or payment processor. [CLS] [SEP]

right to use third-party software. [CLS] [SEP]

evernote may from time to time include as part of the service and evernote
software computer software supplied by third parties which is utilized by
permission of the respective licensors and/or copyright holders on the terms
provided by such parties. [CLS] [SEP] we provide information about some of this third
party software [here](https://evernote.com/opensource/) and within the
particular evernote software. [CLS] [SEP] evernote expressly disclaims any warranty or
other assurance to you regarding such third party software. [CLS] [SEP]

right to update our software. [CLS] [SEP]

in connection with any modification of the service, evernote may automatically
download software updates on your computers and devices from time to time with
the intention of improving, enhancing, repairing and/or further developing the
service. [CLS] [SEP] evernote will endeavor to provide you with the option of whether or
not to install the update; however, in certain circumstances (e.g., security
risks), evernote may require you to install the update to continue accessing
the service. [CLS] [SEP] in all cases, you agree to permit evernote to deliver these
updates to you (and you to receive them) as part of your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### do these terms apply to evernote business users?

if you are using the service as part of an evernote business account, your use
of the service is governed by these terms, except to the extent the separate
agreement governing the evernote business account provides conflicting terms. [CLS] [SEP]
the customer who has contracted with evernote and the administrator of the
evernote business account (as “customer” and “administrator” are defined in
the applicable evernote business agreement) have the responsibility to and
agree to share the terms of such separate agreement with each individual whose
user account is linked to that evernote business account (“end user”). [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an end user of an evernote business account, please note that the
customer of your evernote business account (such as your employer or
organization) may have established its own rules regarding end users’ access,
use, disclosure, or retention of data stored in that account. [CLS] [SEP] you can find
more information on how your personal evernote service account works with your
evernote business account in our privacy policy and in this [help and learning
article](https://help.evernote.com/hc/articles/209005287). [CLS] [SEP]

### how does evernote respond to copyright or other intellectual property
violations?

we respond to clear and complete notices of alleged infringement of copyright,
trademark or other intellectual property laws that satisfy the requirements in
these terms (which we believe to comply with the [united states digital
millennium copyright](http://www.copyright.gov/) and other applicable laws). [CLS] [SEP]
if you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated,
please notify our compliance team according to the instructions provided by
our [ip rights compliance program](/legal/ip-compliance) and we will
investigate. [CLS] [SEP] note that each owner of intellectual property is responsible for
protecting their rights and taking any legal or other action they determine to
be appropriate to do so, and evernote does not accept any obligation to take
any particular action to enforce or protect any party’s intellectual property
rights on their behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

### can kids use evernote?

evernote is not directed to minors, and any use by minors should only be done
with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or
authorized school officials. [CLS] [SEP] further, we rely on parents and guardians to
ensure minors only use the service if they can understand their rights and
responsibilities as stated in these terms and our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

consistent with applicable law, evernote does not knowingly collect personal
information from minors without parental consent. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn that we have
inadvertently obtained information in violation of applicable laws prohibiting
collection of information from children without such consent, we will promptly
delete it. [CLS] [SEP]

### where does my data go?

the service is available worldwide, but your data is stored in the united
states, as described in our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you use the service, you
acknowledge that you may be sending electronic communications (including your
basic subscriber information and content), through computer networks owned by
evernote, its service providers, and other third parties located in california
and other locations in the united states and other countries. [CLS] [SEP] as a result,
your use of the service will likely result in interstate and possibly
international data transmissions, and your use of the service shall constitute
your consent to permit such transmissions. [CLS] [SEP]

### how is my account closed?

you may deactivate your account with our service at any time, for any reason
(or no reason). [CLS] [SEP] however, if you want to deactivate your account you need to
take certain specific steps, which are described in our help & learning
article entitled [“how do i deactivate my
account?”](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/208314088). [CLS] [SEP] if you
subscribe to a paid service, you will need to cancel your subscription
pursuant to our [commercial terms](/legal/commercial-terms). [CLS] [SEP]

evernote may act to temporarily limit your use of the service, suspend access
to your account, or close your account, with or without notice according to
these terms. [CLS] [SEP] reasons for evernote suspending or closing your account may
include, without limitation: (i) breach or violation of these terms (including
the user guidelines) or any separate agreement, (ii) an extended period of
inactivity (determined in evernote’s sole discretion), (iii) your nonpayment
of any fees or other sums due evernote or any other party related to your use
of the service, (iv) the discontinuance or material modification of the
service (or any part thereof) or (v) unexpected technical or security issues
or problems or extensive unsupported use. [CLS] [SEP]

in most cases, in the event we elect to close your account, we will provide at
least 30 days advance notice to you at the email address you have provided to
us, so you have a chance to retrieve any content stored on the service servers
(unless we determine that we are legally prohibited from providing such notice
or enabling you to do so). [CLS] [SEP] after the expiration of this notice period, you
will no longer be able to retrieve content contained in that account or
otherwise use the service through that account. [CLS] [SEP]

### what happens to my account when i die?

evernote’s pledge to protect the privacy of your content will continue, even
after your death or incapacity. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to enable someone to have access
to your content or other data in your account after you are no longer able to
provide them access, you need to implement a process for providing your
information to them. [CLS] [SEP] we will not provide your information, or your content, to
anyone, even next of kin, unless we determine that we are legally obligated to
do so. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to include your basic subscriber information, with
instructions on how to access your content, in your will or other estate
plans, so that anyone you wish to have access to your account will have the
means to do so. [CLS] [SEP] please see our [commercial terms](/legal/commercial-terms) for
information on terminating payment for paid services upon death or incapacity. [CLS] [SEP]

### if i have a great idea to share with evernote, what are my rights?

when you submit any ideas, suggestions, documents and/or proposals relating to
the service (or other products or services) to evernote through the “contact
us,” user forum or support interfaces or through any other channel or
mechanism (collectively, “contributions”), you acknowledge and agree that: (i)
your contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information. [CLS] [SEP]
(ii) evernote is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or
implied, with respect to the contributions. [CLS] [SEP] (iii) evernote shall be entitled
to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such contributions for
any purpose, in any way. [CLS] [SEP] (iv) evernote may have something similar to the
contributions already under consideration or in development. [CLS] [SEP] (v) your
contributions automatically become the property of evernote without any
obligation of evernote to you. [CLS] [SEP] and (vi) you are not entitled to any
accounting, compensation or reimbursement of any kind from evernote under any
circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

### does evernote serve ads?

our business model is to make the service so valuable that our users will want
to subscribe to a paid service. [CLS] [SEP] however, we may display advertisements and
promotions on or in connection with the service, some of which may be paid for
by third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please see our [privacy
policy](/privacy/policy) and [cookie information](/privacy/cookies) page. [CLS] [SEP]

some advertising or other messaging content we provide will be based upon
information provided by third parties, and we shall not be responsible or
liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of any
advertisements or other messages. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, your interactions with
advertisers found on or through the service, including, without limitation,
all reliance upon advertising, all commercial transactions and legal
obligations associated therewith, are solely between you and such advertisers. [CLS] [SEP]

### what else do i need to know?

third-party links, content and programming. [CLS] [SEP]

we may include or recommend third party resources, materials and developers
and/or links to third party websites, content and applications as part of, or
in connection with, the service. [CLS] [SEP] we may have little or no control over such
sites or developers and, accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that (i) we
are not responsible for the availability of such external sites, content or

fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to
your use of any of the service, any violation of these terms of service or any
other actions connected with your use of the service (including all actions
taken under your account). [CLS] [SEP] in the event of such claim, we will endeavor to
provide notice of the claim, suit or action to the contact information we have
for the account, provided that any failure to deliver such notice to you shall
not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligation hereunder. [CLS] [SEP]

limitation of liability and disclaimer of warranties. [CLS] [SEP]

to the maximum extent permitted by law, the service is available “as is.” you
expressly understand and agree that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the service and the purchase and use of any services are all at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] the service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. [CLS] [SEP] to the maximum extent permitted by law, evernote expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] evernote does not warrant that (i) the service will meet all of your requirements. [CLS] [SEP] (ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. [CLS] [SEP] or (iii) all errors in the software or service will be corrected. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the service is done at your own discretion and risk and you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or other device or loss of data resulting from the download or use of any such material. [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from evernote or through or from the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]

you expressly understand and agree that evernote, its subsidiaries,
affiliates, service providers, and licensors, and our and their respective
officers, employees, agents and successors shall not be liable to you for any
direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use,

failure to protect the confidentiality of any passwords or access rights to
your account; (vii) the acts or omissions of any third party using or

service; or (x) any other matter relating to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**exclusions and limitations.**

nothing in these terms of service (including the limitation of liability
provisions) is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or
liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or conditions or the limitation
or exclusion of liability for loss or damage caused by willful acts,
negligence, breach of contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or
consequential damages. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, only those liability and other limitations
which are lawful in your jurisdiction (if any) will apply to you and our
liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

### if evernote has to send me notice of something, how will that happen?

this is another reason why it’s important for you to make sure your basic
subscriber information is accurate, complete and up to date. [CLS] [SEP] we may provide
you with notices by email (to the email address associated with your account),
regular mail or postings on the website(s) related to the affected service. [CLS] [SEP]

use of a different means or address for notice, any notice to evernote must be

you may not use or otherwise export the service or any evernote software
except as authorized by united states (“u.s.”) law and the laws of the
jurisdiction in which the service is hosted or where you use the service. [CLS] [SEP] in
particular, but without limitation, the evernote software may not be (i)
exported or re-exported into any countries that are subject to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] economic
sanctions or (ii) provided to or used by anyone on the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of the

country. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you are responsible for compliance with applicable
export control, economic sanctions and related laws when you travel across
international borders and access your content. [CLS] [SEP]

### what law applies to my use of evernote?

if you are a resident of the united states or canada, these terms and the
relationship between you and evernote (including any dispute) shall be
governed in all respects by the laws of the state of california, united states
of america, as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed
entirely within california between california residents, without regard to its
conflict of law provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

if you reside in brazil, these terms and the relationship between you and
evernote (including any dispute) shall be governed in all respects by the laws
of brazil and shall be considered to have been made and accepted in brazil,
without regard to conflict of law provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

if you reside outside of the united states, canada, and brazil, these terms
and the relationship between you and evernote (including any dispute) shall be
governed in all respects by the laws of switzerland and shall be considered to
have been made and accepted in switzerland, without regard to conflict of law
provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

if any provision of these terms of service is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
provision, and the other provisions of the terms of service remain in full
force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

### what do i do if i think i have a claim against evernote?

let us know about your complaint. [CLS] [SEP]

we want to know if you have a problem so we encourage you to contact our
[customer support team](/contact/support/) if you have any concerns with
respect to the operation of the service or any evernote software, as we want
to ensure that you have an excellent experience. [CLS] [SEP]

initiating a formal claim. [CLS] [SEP]

if you conclude that we have not satisfied your concern and that you must
pursue legal action, you agree that your claim must be resolved by the
processes set forth in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] evernote provides the service to you on
the condition that you accept the dispute resolution provisions described
below, so if you initiate any claim against evernote in any other manner, you
shall be in violation of these terms and you agree that evernote shall be
entitled to have such action dismissed or otherwise terminated and you agree
to reimburse evernote for its reasonable costs incurred in defending against
such improperly initiated claim. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that prior to initiating any formal
proceedings against evernote, you will send us a notice to our attorneys at
legalnotice@evernote.com and state that you are providing a “notice of
dispute.” upon receipt of a notice of dispute, you and we shall attempt to
resolve the dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from
the date the notice of dispute is sent. [CLS] [SEP] if the dispute remains unresolved,
either you or we may initiate formal proceedings according to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as
provided below), if you are a resident of the united states or canada, you
agree that any claim or dispute you may have against evernote must be resolved
exclusively by a state or federal court located in san mateo county,
california. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
courts located within san mateo county, california (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, to exclude the jurisdiction of any other court) for the purpose of
litigating all such claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as
provided below), if you reside in brazil, you agree that any claim or dispute
you may have against evernote must be resolved exclusively by the courts in
são paolo-sp, brasil. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to submit to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the courts located within são paolo-sp, brasil (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, to exclude the jurisdiction of any other court) for the
purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as
provided below), if you are not a resident of the united states, canada, or

zurich, switzerland (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude the
jurisdiction of any other court) for the purpose of litigating all such claims
or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

alternative dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP]

unless you are subject to the arbitration agreement set out below, and subject
to any applicable laws, if a claim arises between you and evernote where the
total value of such claim is less than us$10,000, the party initiating the
claim may elect to have the dispute resolved pursuant to a binding arbitration
process that does not require attendance in person. [CLS] [SEP] this “alternative dispute
resolution process” shall be initiated by either party sending notice to the
other, in which event you and evernote agree to use our reasonable efforts to
agree within thirty (30) days upon an individual or service to manage the
alternative dispute resolution process (the “arbitration manager”) according
to the following requirements: (i) neither party shall be required to attend
any proceeding in person, (ii) the proceeding will be conducted via written
submissions, telephone or online communications or as otherwise agreed upon,
(iii) the fees for the arbitration manager will be borne equally by the
parties or be submitted to the arbitration manager to determine as part of the
dispute and (iv) the judgment rendered by the arbitration manager may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a resident of the european union (eu), please note that we offer
this alternative dispute resolution process, but we cannot offer you the
european commission dispute platform as we do not have an establishment in the
eu. [CLS] [SEP]

arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

if you reside in the united states or are otherwise subject to the us federal
arbitration act, you and evernote agree that any and all disputes or claims
that have arisen or may arise between us - except any dispute relating to the
enforcement or validity of your, our or either of our licensors’ intellectual
property rights - shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small
claims court, if your claims qualify. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] (note that if
you were a service user prior to december 4, 2012 and formally elected to opt
out of the arbitration agreement pursuant to the procedures set out in our
terms of service that were effective as of december 4, 2012, you are not
subject to this arbitration agreement.)

our arbitration proceedings would be conducted by the american arbitration
association ("aaa") under its rules and procedures applicable at that time,
including the aaa's supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes (to
the extent applicable), as modified by our arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you may
review those rules and procedures, and obtain a form for initiating
arbitration proceedings at the [aaa's website](http://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another
mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of the relief sought is us$10,000 or
less, either of us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or
based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on us
subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing. [CLS] [SEP]
attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us,
unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the
laws of the state of california, including recognized principles of equity,
and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall
not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different evernote
users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user
to the extent required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator's award shall be
final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court possessing jurisdiction over the parties, except for a
limited right of appeal under the federal arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP]

the aaa rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration and
arbitrator fees, unless our arbitration agreement expressly provides
otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] if the amount of any claim in an arbitration is us$10,000 or less,
evernote will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated
with the arbitration, so long as (i) you make a written request for such
payment of fees and submit it to the aaa with your demand for arbitration and
(ii) your claim is not determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] in such
case, we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP]
if the amount of the claim exceeds us$10,000 and you are able to demonstrate
that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, evernote will pay as much of the filing, administration and
arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration
from being cost-prohibitive. [CLS] [SEP] if the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you
assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse evernote for
all fees associated with the arbitration paid by evernote on your behalf,
which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the aaa's rules. [CLS] [SEP]

you and evernote agree, as part of the arbitration agreement, that each of us
may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as part
of any purported class or representative action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] we refer to
this as the “prohibition of class and representative actions.” unless both you
and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join your or our
claim with another person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside
over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator may only award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and
declaratory relief) in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's
individual claim(s). [CLS] [SEP] any relief awarded cannot affect other evernote users. [CLS] [SEP]

except with respect to the prohibition of class and representative actions, if
a court decides that any part of this arbitration agreement is invalid or
unenforceable, the other parts of this arbitration agreement shall continue to
apply. [CLS] [SEP] if a court decides that the prohibition of class and representative
actions is invalid or unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement
shall be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] the remainder of these terms and this section (what do
i do if i think i have a claim against evernote?) will continue to apply. [CLS] [SEP]

claims are time-barred. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary or the
applicable dispute resolution process, any claim or cause of action you may
have arising out of or related to use of the service or otherwise under these
must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing such claim. [CLS] [SEP]

the provisions of this section, entitled “claims are time-barred” shall be
deemed to constitute a separate written legally binding agreement by and
between you and us. [CLS] [SEP]

special notice for california users. [CLS] [SEP]

under california civil code section 1789.3, users of the service from
california are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: the
complaint assistance unit of the division of consumer services of the
california department of consumer affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625
north market blvd., suite n 112, sacramento, ca 95834, or by telephone at
(916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210. [CLS] [SEP] you may contact us via email at
[legalnotice@evernote.com](mailto:legalnotice@evernote.com) or at:

evernote corporation  
305 walnut street  
redwood city, california 94063 usa  
attention: legal notice

### anything else?

a couple of final, but important, points. [CLS] [SEP] first, these terms constitute the
entire agreement between you and evernote and govern your use of the service,
except for, and then only to the extent that you have entered into a separate
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] these terms supersede any prior agreements or earlier versions of
these terms between you and evernote for the use of the service as of the
effective date indicated at the top of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if, through accessing or
using the service, you utilize or obtain any product or service from a third
party, you may additionally be subject to such third party’s terms and
conditions applicable thereto, and these terms shall not affect your legal
relationship with such third party. [CLS] [SEP]

second, you acknowledge and agree that each affiliate of evernote shall be a
third party beneficiary to these terms and that such other companies shall be
entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of these terms
which confers a benefit on (or provides rights in favor of) them. [CLS] [SEP] other than
this, no other person or company shall be a third party beneficiary to these
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

finally, the section headings in these terms of service are for convenience
only and have no legal or contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event of a conflict, the english language version shall govern. [CLS] [SEP]
