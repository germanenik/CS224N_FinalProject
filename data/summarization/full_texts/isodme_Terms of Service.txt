###  1\. [CLS] [SEP] overview

this universal terms of service agreement (this “agreement”) is entered
between you and isodme, a d.b.a. [CLS] [SEP] partnership registered in the united states
of america, and is made effective as of the date of your use of this website
("site") or the date of electronic acceptance. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement sets forth the
final terms and conditions of your use of the site and the products and
services accessed through this website (individually and jointly, the
“services”), and is in addition to (not in lieu of) any specific terms and
conditions that apply to the actual services. [CLS] [SEP] whether you're merely browsing
or using this website, your use of this site and your electronic acceptance of
this agreement signifies that you have read, understand, acknowledge and agree
to be sure by this agreement, along with the following policies and the
applicable product agreements, which are incorporated herein by reference: the
terms “we”, “us” or “our” shall refer to isodme. [CLS] [SEP] the terms “you”, “your”,
“user” or “customer” shall refer to any individual or entity who accepts this
agreement, has access to your account or uses the services. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this
agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits. [CLS] [SEP] isodme
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change or modify this agreement, and
any policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, at any time, and
such changes or modifications shall be effective instantly upon posting to

modifications are made shall constitute your acceptance of this agreement as
last revised. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to be bound by this agreement as last
revised, do not use (or still use) this website or the services. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,

### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] spam content rules

no spam. [CLS] [SEP] we do not tolerate the transmission of spam. [CLS] [SEP] we monitor all traffic
to and from our web servers for indications of spamming. [CLS] [SEP] customers suspected
to be using our products and services for the purpose of sending spam are
fully investigated. [CLS] [SEP] if we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take
the appropriate action to resolve the situation. [CLS] [SEP]  
we define spam as the sending of unsolicited commercial email (uce),
unsolicited bulk email (ube) or unsolicited facsimiles (fax), which is email
or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without
first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications. [CLS] [SEP] this

  * instant messages (using aol, msn, yahoo or other instant messenger programs) 
  * online chat room advertisements 
  * guestbook or website forum postings 
  * facsimile solicitations 
  * text/sms messages 

we will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes
described above. [CLS] [SEP] in order to use our products and services, you must not only
abide by all applicable laws and regulations but you must also abide by this
no spam policy. [CLS] [SEP] commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be
sent to recipients who have "opted-in" to receive messages. [CLS] [SEP] they must include
a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical
address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax. [CLS] [SEP] upon request
by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax
number. [CLS] [SEP]  
if we determine the services in question are being used in association with
spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any website hosting, domain
registration, email boxes or other applicable services until customer
responds. [CLS] [SEP] the registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to
us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] in the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services
have been restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email
boxes associated with the domain name in question. [CLS] [SEP]  
we encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products
and services to report suspected spam. [CLS] [SEP] suspected abuse can be reported by
email abuse@isodme.com. [CLS] [SEP]

### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] liquidated damages

you agree that we may immediately terminate any account which we believe, in
our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected
with any spam or other unsolicited bulk emails

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] our use of user content

the provisions of this section apply specifically to isodme’s use of user
content posted to isodme’s corporate websites (i.e., those sites which isodme
directly controls or maintains). [CLS] [SEP] the applicable provisions are not intended to
and do not have the effect of transferring any ownership or licensed rights
(including intellectual property rights) you may have in content posted to
your hosted websites. [CLS] [SEP] generally:

  * you shall be solely responsible for any and all of your user content or user content that is submitted through your account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it. [CLS] [SEP]

with respect to user submissions. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that:

  * your user submissions are entirely voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * your user submissions do not establish a confidential relationship or obligate isodme to treat your user submissions as confidential or secret. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * isodme has no obligation, either express or implied, to develop or use your user submissions, and no compensation is due to you or to anyone else for any intentional or unintentional use of your user submissions. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * isodme may be working on the same or similar content, it may already know of such content from other sources, it may simply wish to develop this (or similar) content on its own, or it may have taken / will take some other action. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * isodme shall own exclusive rights (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) to any user submissions posted to this site, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of any user submissions posted to this site for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you or to anyone else. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * with respect to user content (other than user submissions). [CLS] [SEP] 

if you have a website or other content hosted by isodme, you shall retain all
of your ownership or licensed rights in user content. [CLS] [SEP]  
by posting or publishing user content to this site or through the services,
you authorize isodme to use the intellectual property and other proprietary
rights in and to your user content to enable inclusion and use of the user
content in the manner contemplated by this site and this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby
grant isodme a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable (through
multiple tiers), and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute,
prepare derivative works of, combine with other works, display, and perform
your user content in connection with this site, the services and isodme’s (and
isodme’s affiliates’) business(es), including without limitation for promoting
and redistributing all or part of this site in any media formats and through
any media channels without restrictions of any kind and without payment or
other consideration of any kind, or permission or notification, to you or any
third party. [CLS] [SEP] you also hereby grant each user of this site a non-exclusive
license to access your user content (with the exception of user content that
you designate “private” or “password protected”) through this site, and to
use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, combine with other
works, display, and perform your user content as permitted through the
functionality of this site and under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the above licenses
granted by you in your user content terminate within a commercially reasonable
time after you remove or delete your user content from this site. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand and agree, however, that isodme may retain (but not distribute,
display, or perform) server copies of your user content that have been removed
or deleted. [CLS] [SEP] the above licenses granted by you in your user content are
perpetual and irrevocable. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, isodme shall not use any user content that has been designated
“private” or “password protected” by you for the purpose of promoting this
site or isodme’s (or isodme’s affiliates’) business(es). [CLS] [SEP]  
you also authorize isodme to use your user content in any promotional
material. [CLS] [SEP]

### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] backups

while we do have weekly backups, these are solely for acts of god. [CLS] [SEP] for
instance, if our server goes down, we still have a backup from the week
before. [CLS] [SEP] being a user, you cannot access these. [CLS] [SEP] we do not warrant that we
conduct these, as sometimes there are higher priorities and if our servers are
in operational state, the backups will not be taken. [CLS] [SEP]  
thus, it is extremely important that you conduct weekly backups of your own
data as well for your own use. [CLS] [SEP]

### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] monitoring of content and account termination

isodme generally does not pre-screen user content (whether posted to a website
hosted by isodme or posted to this site). [CLS] [SEP] however, isodme reserves the right
(but undertakes no duty) to do so and decide whether any item of user content
is appropriate and/or complies with this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] isodme may remove any item
of user content (whether posted to a website hosted by isodme or posted to
this site) and/or terminate a user’s access to this site or the services found
at this site for posting or publishing any material in violation of this
agreement, or for otherwise violating this agreement (as determined by isodme
in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP]
isodme may also terminate a user’s access to this site or the services found
at this site if isodme has reason to believe the user is a repeat offender. [CLS] [SEP] if
isodme terminates your access to this site or the services found at this site,
isodme may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove and destroy any data
and files stored by you on its servers. [CLS] [SEP]

### 13\. [CLS] [SEP] additional reservation of rights

isodme expressly reserves the right to deny, cancel, terminate, suspend, lock,
or modify access to (or control of) any account or services (including the
right to cancel or transfer any domain name registration) for any reason (as
determined by isodme in its sole and absolute discretion), including but not
limited to the following: (i) to correct mistakes made by isodme in offering
or delivering any services, (ii) to assist with our fraud and abuse detection
and prevention efforts, (iii) to comply with court orders against you and/or
your domain name or website and applicable local, state, national and
international laws, rules and regulations, (iv) to comply with requests of law
enforcement, including subpoena requests, (v) to comply with any dispute
resolution process, (vi) to defend any legal action or threatened legal action
without consideration for whether such legal action or threatened legal action
is eventually determined to be with or without merit, or (vii) to avoid any
civil or criminal liability on the part of isodme, its officers, directors,
employees and agents, as well as isodme ’s affiliates, including, but not
limited to, instances where you have sued or threatened to sue isodme. [CLS] [SEP]  
isodme expressly reserves the right to terminate, without notice to you, any
and all services where, in isodme's sole discretion, you are harassing or
threatening isodme and/or any of isodme's employees. [CLS] [SEP]

### 14\. [CLS] [SEP] trademark and/or copyright claims

isodme supports the protection of intellectual property. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like to
submit a trademark claim for violation of a mark on which you hold a valid,
registered trademark or service mark or a copyright claim for material on
which you hold a bona fide copyright, please send them at abuse@isodme.com. [CLS] [SEP]
otherwise, isodme, though it may not explicitly own its user content,
maintains ownership of our trademarks, and these may not be used without
consent. [CLS] [SEP]  
some of our policies are based off of other companies. [CLS] [SEP] if you are part of one
of these and you have an issue, please contact us as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

### 15\. [CLS] [SEP] links to third party websites

this site and the services found at this site may contain links to third-party
websites that are not owned or controlled by isodme. [CLS] [SEP] we assume no
responsibility for the content, terms and conditions, privacy policies, or
practices of any third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, isodme does not censor or
edit the content of any third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] by using this site or the
