you access to and use of our services. [CLS] [SEP] you can find an overview of our
policies [here](/help/policies/default/ebays-rules-policies?id=4205). [CLS] [SEP] the

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] about ebay

ebay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about
anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. [CLS] [SEP] the actual contract
for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. [CLS] [SEP] ebay is not a traditional
auctioneer. [CLS] [SEP]

any guidance we provide as part of our services, such as pricing, shipping,
listing, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it
or not. [CLS] [SEP] also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through
various programs, ebay has no control over and does not guarantee: the
existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or
accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items;
the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will
actually complete a transaction or return an item. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] using ebay

in connection with using or accessing our services you will not:

  * post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites;
  * breach or circumvent any laws, regulations, third-party rights or our systems, services, policies, or determinations of your account status;
  * use our services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our services, or are a person with whom transactions are prohibited under economic or trade sanctions;
  * fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an ebay policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller (see our [unpaid item policy](/help/policies/payment-policies/unpaid-item-policy?id=4271));
  * fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an ebay policy, for example, the buyer fails to comply with the posted terms in your listing or you cannot contact the buyer;
  * manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user's listings;
  * post false, inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, defamatory, or libelous content;
  * take any action that may undermine the feedback or ratings systems (our [feedback policies](/help/policies/feedback-policies/feedback-policies?id=4208));
  * transfer your ebay account (including feedback) and user id to another party without our consent;
  * distribute or post spam, unsolicited or bulk electronic communications, chain letters, or pyramid schemes;
  * distribute viruses or any other technologies that may harm ebay or the interests or property of users;
  * use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of ebay;
  * interfere with the functioning of our services, such as by imposing an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
  * export or re-export any ebay application or tool, except in compliance with the export control laws, and rules and policies of any relevant jurisdictions;
  * infringe the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity, moral, database, and/or other intellectual property rights (collectively, "intellectual property rights") that belong to or are licensed to ebay. [CLS] [SEP] some, but not all, actions that may constitute infringement are reproducing, performing, displaying, distributing, copying, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or preparing derivative works from content that belongs to ebay or someone else;
  * infringe any intellectual property rights that belong to third parties affected by your use of our services or post content that does not belong to you;
  * commercialize any ebay application or any information or software associated with such application, except with the prior express permission of ebay;
  * harvest or otherwise collect information about users without their consent; or
  * circumvent any technical measures used to provide our services. [CLS] [SEP]

sellers must meet ebay's [minimum performance standards](/help/selling/seller-
levels-performance-standards/seller-levels-performance-standards?id=4080). [CLS] [SEP]
failure to meet these standards may result in ebay charging you additional
fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller
account. [CLS] [SEP]

if we believe you are abusing ebay and/or our services in any way, we may, in
our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or
terminate your user account(s) and access to our services, delay or remove
hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s),
remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any
discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

if we believe you are violating our policies prohibiting [offers to buy or
sell outside of ebay](/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-
ebay-policy?id=4272), you may be subject to a range of actions, including
limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and
account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and
recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a
seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for
their contact information in the context of [buying or selling outside of
ebay](/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-
policy?id=4272), you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that
item, even if the item does not sell. [CLS] [SEP]

we may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a
substantial period of time. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we reserve the right to refuse,
modify, or terminate all or part of our services to anyone for any reason at
our discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] policy enforcement

when a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance
history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. [CLS] [SEP] we may choose
to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing
for both buyers and sellers. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] fees and taxes

the fees we charge for using our services are listed on our [selling
fees](/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4364) pages. [CLS] [SEP] we may
change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the ebay
site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary
promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all
sales made using some or all of our services, even if sales terms are
finalized or payment is made outside of ebay. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, if you offer or
reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact
information in the context of buying or selling outside of ebay, you may be
liable to pay a [final value fee](/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-
fees?id=4364#section2) applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell,
given your usage of our services for the introduction to a buyer. [CLS] [SEP]

you must have a payment method on file when selling through our services and
pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our services by the payment
due date. [CLS] [SEP] if your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may
collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain
collection agencies and legal counsel, suspend or limit services, and for
accounts over 60 days past due, request that paypal deduct the amount owed
from your paypal account balance. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you will be subject to [late
fees](/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/setting-changing-payment-
method?id=4124#requirements). [CLS] [SEP] ebay, or the collection agencies we retain, may
also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result,
late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be
reflected in your credit report. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to dispute the information ebay
reported to a credit bureau (i.e., experian, equifax or transunion) please
contact us at ebay inc., c/o global collections, 7700 west parmer lane,
building d, austin, tx 78729. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to dispute the information a
collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your ebay account, you
must contact the collection agency directly. [CLS] [SEP]

in any jurisdiction where ebay has an obligation to collect sales taxes on
sales you make using our services, we may collect such sales taxes from you
via the payment method on file under the terms of the billing agreement or via
any other means available to us. [CLS] [SEP]

seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our services. [CLS] [SEP]
we may display third-party advertisements (including links and references
thereto) or other content in any part of our services, in our sole discretion
and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to,
sellers. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] listing conditions

when listing an item for sale on our services, you agree to comply with ebay's
[listing policies](/help/policies/listing-policies/listing-policies?id=4213)
and [selling practices policy](/help/policies/selling-policies/selling-
practices-policy?id=4346) and that:

  * you assume full responsibility for the item offered and the accuracy and content of the listing,
  * your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). [CLS] [SEP] ebay can't guarantee exact listing duration,
  * your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the listing is ended by you or ebay, in its sole discretion,
  * content that violates any of ebay's policies may be modified, obfuscated or deleted at ebay's sole discretion,
  * we may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct information,
  * we strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
    * buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;
    * item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;
    * seller's history, including listing practices, detailed seller ratings, ebay policy compliance, feedback, and defect rate; and
    * number of listings matching the buyer's query,
  * to drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,
  * some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our services,
  * ebay's [duplicate listings policy](/help/policies/listing-policies/duplicate-listings-policy?id=4255) may also affect whether your listing appears in search results,
  * metatags and url links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect third-party search engine results,
  * we may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings. [CLS] [SEP] such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results may vary for individual listings. [CLS] [SEP] to drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers,
  * for items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold at certain price points, ebay may require the use of certain payment methods, subject to our [payments methods policy](/help/policies/payment-policies/accepted-payments-policy?id=4269). [CLS] [SEP] for example, for inventory covered by authentication services, buyer and sellers may be subject to escrow, screening, shipping, and/or payment handling requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] purchase conditions

when buying an item on our services, you agree to the [rules and policies for
buyers](/help/policies/rules-policies-buyers/rules-policies-buyers?id=4206)
and that:

  * you are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or committing to buy,
  * you enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted),
  * for motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller,
  * we do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer,
  * utah code annotated § 70a-2-401(2) and uniform commercial code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] international buying and selling; translation

many of our services are accessible internationally. [CLS] [SEP] we may offer certain
programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international
sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and
international shipping calculation tools. [CLS] [SEP] sellers and buyers are responsible
for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international
sale, purchase, and shipment of items. [CLS] [SEP]

if you purchase an item on an ebay site that is different from your
registration site, you are subject to the user agreement and applicable
policies of that other ebay site with respect to that particular purchase, as
detailed in the [international selling policy](/help/policies/selling-
policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689). [CLS] [SEP]

for sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an ebay
site other than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your
shipping settings. [CLS] [SEP] you may adjust these settings as detailed in the
[international selling policy](/help/policies/selling-policies/international-
selling-policy?id=4689). [CLS] [SEP] if you list your items with an international shipping
option, the appearance of your listings on sites other than the listing site
is not guaranteed. [CLS] [SEP] if you sell an item on an ebay site that is different from
your registration site, you are subject to the user agreement and applicable
policies, including any buyer protection programs, of that other ebay site
with respect to that particular sale, as detailed in the [international
selling policy](/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-
policy?id=4689). [CLS] [SEP]

you authorize us to use automated tools to translate your ebay content and
member-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages
where such translation solutions are available. [CLS] [SEP] we may provide you with tools
which will enable you to translate content at your request. [CLS] [SEP] the accuracy and
availability of any translation are not guaranteed. [CLS] [SEP]

one of the ways that we may make ebay.com listings available to international
buyers on ebay.com and on ebay's international sites is through the [global
shipping program](/help/selling/shipping-items/setting-shipping-
options/global-shipping-program?id=4646). [CLS] [SEP] for eligible items located in the
united states and purchased by an international buyer through the global
shipping program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel
processing facility located in the united states after receiving notification
of payment from the buyer. [CLS] [SEP] pitney bowes inc., a third-party global shipping
provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international
shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent a
buyer has a question about your global shipping program listings, ebay may
respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services
overseen by pitney bowes inc. [CLS] [SEP] (for example, customs or international
shipping). [CLS] [SEP] sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the global
shipping program. [CLS] [SEP]

pursuant to a routed export transaction under the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export administration
regulations and foreign trade regulations, the buyer, as the foreign principal
party in interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export
shipment, with pitney bowes inc. [CLS] [SEP] acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. [CLS] [SEP] you
remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you
agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information. [CLS] [SEP]

you consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information,
as well as listing and order information, by ebay to pitney bowes inc., and by
pitney bowes inc. [CLS] [SEP] to its affiliates, service providers, and other third
parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government
agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance,
and international transportation of any item. [CLS] [SEP] ebay does not control the
privacy policies of pitney bowes inc., its affiliates, or its service
providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

additional information about the program, including policies governing
feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and
the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the
program, can be found on our [global shipping program \- opens in new window

infringement pursuant to section 512(c) of title 17 of the united states code

we respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement under the united
states digital millennium copyright act. [CLS] [SEP] ebay's verified rights owner (vero)

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] holds and restricted funds

to protect ebay from risk of liability for your actions as a seller, ebay has
at times recommended, and may continue to recommend, that paypal restrict
access to funds in a seller's paypal account based on certain factors,
including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, returns,
riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, or the filing of an ebay
money back guarantee case. [CLS] [SEP] this may result in paypal restricting funds in your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

in connection with managed payments as described in section 14, we may also
restrict seller access to funds based on the factors described in the
[payments terms of use](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html). [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] authorization to contact you; recording calls; analyzing message

ebay may collect other telephone numbers for you and may place manual non-
marketing calls to any of those numbers and autodialed non-marketing calls to

record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with
ebay or its agents for quality control and training purposes, or for its own
protection. [CLS] [SEP]

ebay's automated systems scan and analyze the contents of every message sent
through its messages platform, including messages between users, to detect and
prevent fraudulent activity or violations of ebay's user agreement, including
the incorporated terms, notices, rules, and policies. [CLS] [SEP] this scanning and
analysis may occur before, during, or after the message is sent, or while in

store message contents, including to conduct this scanning and analysis. [CLS] [SEP]

### privacy of others; marketing

if ebay provides you with information about another user, you agree you will
use the information only for the purposes that it is provided to you. [CLS] [SEP] you may
not disclose, sell, rent, or distribute a user's information to a third party

information for marketing purposes, via electronic or other means, unless you
obtain the consent of the specific user to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] additional terms

### returns and cancellations

sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under
certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] for all new sellers, in listings where returns are
accepted, ebay will set a default rule that automates the return process. [CLS] [SEP]
sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account
settings within my ebay. [CLS] [SEP] where settings have been set to automatically accept
requests for returns or replacements, an ebay-generated return shipping label
will be provided to your buyer. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to comply with our [returns
policy](/help/selling/managing-returns-refunds/managing-returns-
refunds?id=4079). [CLS] [SEP]

when an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize ebay
to request that paypal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency)
from your paypal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your
payment method on file. [CLS] [SEP]

the cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the
seller's responsibility. [CLS] [SEP]

you (as seller) authorize ebay to place the return shipping label cost on your
invoice, subject to your automatic payment method on file when:

  * an ebay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;
  * returns have been automated;
  * you fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an ebay-generated shipping label is used; and/or
  * a transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize ebay to request that paypal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] see [canceling a transaction](/help/selling/getting-paid/cancelling-transaction?id=4136) for more details. [CLS] [SEP]

### ebay money back guarantee

most ebay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the
ebay money back guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve
issues. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final
decision on any ebay money back guarantee case. [CLS] [SEP]

if you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse
a buyer or ebay under the ebay money back guarantee, you authorize ebay to
request that paypal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other
currency) from your paypal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or
charge your payment method on file. [CLS] [SEP] if we cannot get reimbursement from you,
we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms,
including retaining collection agencies. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend the [ebay money back guarantee](/help/policies/ebay-money-back-
guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210) in whole or in part
without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of
the policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] managed payments

ebay has launched a new managed payments service, where a designated ebay
entity (each, a "payments entity") manages payments on behalf of sellers (such
management described as "managed payments" or similar). [CLS] [SEP] some ebay sellers have
already enrolled in managed payments. [CLS] [SEP] ebay anticipates moving more seller
accounts to managed payments in phases starting in july 2020, providing notice
to the affected sellers as they are scheduled to be moved. [CLS] [SEP]

when we enable your account for managed payments, to continue to list and sell
on ebay, as directed by the payments entity, each transitioned ebay seller
registered in the us must:

  * provide the payments entity with information about you and/or your business to meet its compliance requirements, including those involving identity verification, anti-money laundering controls, and sanctions screening as required by applicable laws and policies; and
  * pass such verification and screening and otherwise meet the compliance requirements of the payments entity, as determined by the payments entity; and
  * provide bank account information for a u.s.-based checking account so that the payments entity can link such checking account to your ebay account, allowing the payments entity to pay you. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition:

  * the payments entity may obtain information about you from third-parties to verify your identity, comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, and for other purposes in connection with managed payments; and
  * the payments entity may use third-party payments service providers to assist it in providing managed payments services, including companies that process payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance checks, verify identity, and validate payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] ebay, the payments entity, and their affiliates may send personal data associated with you and your account to such third-parties. [CLS] [SEP]

the payments entity may, in its sole discretion, manage payments on your
behalf even if you haven't provided all requested information, and the
payments entity may withhold payouts pending receipt of such information. [CLS] [SEP]

the complete terms governing sellers' use of managed payments are available in
the [payments terms of use \- opens in new window or
tab](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html), incorporated herein. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree to the [payments terms of use \- opens in new window or
tab](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html) to the extent applicable
to you, whether or not your account has been enabled for managed payments. [CLS] [SEP]

the contract for sale underlying the purchase of goods is directly concluded
between seller and the buyer in the same manner as for transactions for which
the payments entity does not manage payments. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a buyer completing a purchase from a seller that is using managed
payments:

  * you may pay for such items using those payment methods that the payments entity makes available, and the payments entity will manage settlement to sellers. [CLS] [SEP] by completing purchases from sellers who use managed payments, buyers authorize the payments entity to initiate payments using the buyers' selected payment method and collect the transaction amounts on behalf of sellers. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, payments received by the payments entity from buyers satisfy buyers' obligations to pay sellers in the amount of payments received. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, aml compliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with ebay's internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of ebay or the payments entity, or a policy of one of the payments entity's third party payments services providers. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ebay, the payments entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered by you on our services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any other transaction on our services where card information is entered. [CLS] [SEP] such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for future transactions on our services. [CLS] [SEP] at any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card information shall be stored as your default payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may make changes to your default payment method through the personal information section under the account tab in my ebay. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to ebay updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. [CLS] [SEP] you will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may seek returns or cancellations on our services, or file ebay money back guarantee claims on our services, in the same manner as you do for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments. [CLS] [SEP] the payments entity refunds amounts paid for successful ebay money back guarantee claims and returned or cancelled transactions in cases where the original payment was managed by the payments entity. [CLS] [SEP] refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of managed payments. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that some third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in connection with managed payments transactions. [CLS] [SEP] failure to abide by third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the payments entity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer of warranties; limitation of liability

we try to keep our services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we
cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our services. [CLS] [SEP] bid
update and other notification functionality in ebay's applications may not
occur in real time. [CLS] [SEP] such functionality is subject to delays beyond ebay's
control. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that you are making use of our services at your own risk, and that
they are being provided to you on an "as is" and "as available" basis. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express

implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our
parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and our and their officers, directors,
agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us

  * your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this user agreement or our policies. [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of
damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our
liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any
amounts due under the ebay money back guarantee up to the price the item sold
for on ebay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping
costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which
you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the
liability, or (c) $100. [CLS] [SEP]

## 16\. [CLS] [SEP] release

if you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our
affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or
in any way connected with such disputes. [CLS] [SEP] **in entering into this release you
expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would
otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims
which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing
to this release.**

## 17\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnity

you will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as
well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents)
harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by
any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement,
your improper use of our services or your breach of any law or the rights of a
third party. [CLS] [SEP]

## 18\. [CLS] [SEP] legal disputes

**please read this section carefully. [CLS] [SEP] it affects your rights and will have a
substantial impact on how claims you and ebay have against each other are
resolved.**

**in this legal disputes section, the term "related third parties" includes
your and ebay's respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies,
predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, ebay's, and these
entities' respective employees and agents.**

**you and ebay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has
arisen, or may arise, between you and ebay (or any related third parties) that
relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this user
agreement, your use of or access to the services, the actions of ebay or its
agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the services,
will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this legal
disputes section.**

### a. [CLS] [SEP] applicable law

you agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal
law, the laws of the state of utah, without regard to principles of conflict
of laws, will govern this user agreement and any claim or dispute that has
arisen or may arise between you and ebay, except as otherwise stated in this
user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

### b. [CLS] [SEP] agreement to arbitrate

**you and ebay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have
arisen, or may arise, between you and ebay (or any related third parties) that
relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the user
agreement, your use of or access to our services, the actions of ebay or its
agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our
services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
rather than in court. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, you may assert your claims in small
claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such
court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative)
basis. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement
of this agreement to arbitrate.**

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief**

**you and ebay agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only
on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class, or representative or private attorney general action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]
unless both you and ebay agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
or join more than one person 's or party's claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, class, or private
attorney general action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] also, the arbitrator may award relief
(including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). [CLS] [SEP] any relief awarded
cannot affect other users.** if a court decides that applicable law precludes
enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or
a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief),
then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy
request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court,
subject to your and ebay's right to appeal the court's decision. [CLS] [SEP] all other
claims will be arbitrated. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **arbitration procedures**

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration uses a
neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an
arbitration award is very limited. [CLS] [SEP] however, an arbitrator can award the same
damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an
individual. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator should apply the terms of the user agreement as a
court would. [CLS] [SEP] all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues
relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this agreement to
arbitrate, or the interpretation of section 1 of this agreement to arbitrate
("prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized
relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association
("aaa") under its rules and procedures, including the aaa's consumer
arbitration rules and the aaa's commercial arbitration rules (as applicable),
as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa's rules are available at
[www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP] in the event that the aaa is unavailable
to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the
parties or the court. [CLS] [SEP]

a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
certified mail, a valid notice of dispute ("notice"), which may be downloaded
at [this link \- opens in new window or
tab](http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/notice_of_dispute.pdf). [CLS] [SEP] the notice
to ebay must be sent to ebay inc., attn: litigation department, re: notice of
dispute, 583 w. [CLS] [SEP] ebay way, draper, ut 84020. [CLS] [SEP] ebay will send any notice to you
to the physical address we have on file associated with your ebay account; it
is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. [CLS] [SEP] to be valid,
you must personally sign the notice and complete all information on the notice
form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are
asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number
associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you and ebay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid notice
within 30 days after ebay receives that notice, you or ebay may initiate
arbitration proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is
available on the aaa's site at www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to filing this form
with the aaa in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating
the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. [CLS] [SEP]
you may send a copy to ebay at the following address: ebay, inc. [CLS] [SEP] c/o ct
corporation system, 1108 e south union ave., midvale, ut 84047. [CLS] [SEP] in the event
ebay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the
completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your
ebay account. [CLS] [SEP] any settlement offer made by you or ebay shall not be disclosed
to the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at
another mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] where no disclosed claims or counterclaims
exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents
only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing,
if the circumstances warrant. [CLS] [SEP] in cases where an in-person hearing is held, you
and/or ebay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all
claims of privilege recognized by law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall not be bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same ebay user to the extent
required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding
and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **costs of arbitration**

payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
the aaa's rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if
you complied with the notice of dispute procedures of section 2 of this
agreement ("arbitration procedures") and the value of the relief sought is
$10,000 or less, at your request, ebay will pay all administration and
arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] any request for payment of
fees by ebay should be submitted by mail to the aaa along with your demand for
arbitration and ebay will make arrangements to pay administration and
arbitrator fees directly to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] in the event the arbitrator determines
the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to
reimburse ebay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by ebay on
your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the aaa's
rules. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] **severability**

with the exception of any of the provisions in section 1 of this agreement to
arbitrate ("prohibition of class and representative actions and non-
individualized relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of
this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of
this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] **opt-out procedure**

**if you are a new user of our services, you can choose to reject this
agreement to arbitrate ( "opt-out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice
("opt-out notice"). [CLS] [SEP] the opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30
days after the date you accept the user agreement for the first time. [CLS] [SEP] you must
mail the opt-out notice to ebay inc., attn: litigation department, re: opt-out
notice, 583 west ebay way, draper, ut 84020.**

for your convenience, we are providing an [opt-out notice form \- opens in new
window or tab](https://pages.ebay.com/policies/arbitrate-optout.html). [CLS] [SEP] you
must complete and mail that to us in order to opt out of the agreement to
arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] you must complete the opt-out notice form by providing the
information called for in the form, including your name, address (including
street address, city, state and zip code), and the user id(s) and email
address(es) associated with the ebay service account(s) to which the opt-out
applies. [CLS] [SEP] you must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. [CLS] [SEP] this
procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if
you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of this user
agreement and its legal disputes section will continue to apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] opting
out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or
future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP]

  6. [CLS] [SEP] **future amendments to the agreement to arbitrate**

notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and
we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate (other
than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the
future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal
proceeding against ebay prior to the effective date of the amendment. [CLS] [SEP] the
amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the
agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and ebay. [CLS] [SEP] we
will notify you of amendments to this agreement to arbitrate by posting the
amended terms on www.ebay.com at least 30 days before the effective date of
the amendments and by providing notice through the ebay message center and/or
by email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your
account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### c. [CLS] [SEP] judicial forum for legal disputes

unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the agreement to
arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or
dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to
arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you
agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and
ebay must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in salt
lake county, utah. [CLS] [SEP] you and ebay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
of the courts located within salt lake county, utah for the purpose of
litigating all such claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

## 19\. [CLS] [SEP] general

except as otherwise provided in this user agreement, if any provision of this
user agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable,
such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and

sales you make using ebay services, we may collect such sales taxes from you
via the payment method on file under the terms of the billing agreement or via
any other means available to us. [CLS] [SEP]

seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on ebay, whether
on a web page, mobile app, or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] we may display third-party
advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in
any part of our services, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or

ebay's [listing policies](/help/policies/listing-policies/listing-
policies?id=4213) and [selling practices policy](/help/policies/selling-
policies/selling-practices-policy?id=4346) and that:

  * you are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered,
  * your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). [CLS] [SEP] ebay can't guarantee exact listing durations,
  * your fixed-price listings currently renew automatically every 30 days, based on the listing terms at that time, until the quantities sell out or until you cancel the listing. [CLS] [SEP] your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the listing is ended by you or ebay, in its sole discretion,
  * content that violates any of ebay's policies may be modified, obfuscated or deleted at ebay's discretion,
  * we may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct information,
  * we strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
    * buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;
    * item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;
    * seller's history, including listing practices, detailed seller ratings, ebay policy compliance, feedback, and defect rate; and
    * number of listings matching the buyer's query,
  * to drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,
  * some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain services,
  * ebay's [duplicate listings policy](/help/policies/listing-policies/duplicate-listings-policy?id=4255) may also affect whether your listing appears in search results
  * metatags and url links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect third-party search engine results,
  * we may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings. [CLS] [SEP] such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results will vary for individual listings. [CLS] [SEP] to drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to those of other sellers. [CLS] [SEP]

### purchase conditions

buyers](/help/policies/rules-policies-buyers/rules-policies-buyers?id=4206)

  * you enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted),
  * for motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller,
  * we do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer,
  * utah code annotated § 70a-2-401(2) and uniform commercial code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

### international buying and selling; translation

many of our services are accessible internationally. [CLS] [SEP] we may offer certain
programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international
sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and
international shipping calculation tools. [CLS] [SEP] sellers and buyers are responsible
for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international

other than ebay.com, you are subject to the user agreement of that other ebay

detailed in the [international selling policy](/help/policies/selling-
policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689). [CLS] [SEP]

for sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an ebay

shipping settings. [CLS] [SEP] you may adjust these settings as detailed in the
[international selling policy](/help/policies/selling-policies/international-
selling-policy?id=4689). [CLS] [SEP] if you list your items with an international shipping

where such translation solutions are available. [CLS] [SEP] we may provide you with tools
which will enable you to translate content at your request. [CLS] [SEP] the accuracy and
availability of any translation are not guaranteed. [CLS] [SEP]

one of the ways that we may make ebay.com listings available to international
buyers on ebay.com and on ebay's international sites is through the [global
shipping program](/help/selling/shipping-items/setting-shipping-
options/global-shipping-program?id=4646). [CLS] [SEP] for eligible items located in the
united states and purchased by an international buyer through the global
shipping program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel
processing facility located in the united states after receiving notification
of payment from the buyer. [CLS] [SEP] pitney bowes inc., a third-party global shipping
provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international
shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent a
buyer has a question about your global shipping program listings, ebay may
respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services
overseen by pitney bowes inc. [CLS] [SEP] (for example, customs or international
shipping). [CLS] [SEP] sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the global
shipping program. [CLS] [SEP]

pursuant to a routed export transaction under the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export administration
regulations and foreign trade regulations, the buyer, as the foreign principal
party in interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export
shipment, with pitney bowes inc. [CLS] [SEP] acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. [CLS] [SEP] you
remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you
agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information. [CLS] [SEP]

agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance,

privacy policies of pitney bowes inc., its affiliates, or its service

  * **returns and cancellations**  
sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under
certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] for all new sellers, in listings where returns are
accepted, ebay will set a default rule that automates the return process. [CLS] [SEP]
sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account
settings within my ebay. [CLS] [SEP] where settings have been set to automatically accept
requests for returns or replacements, an ebay-generated return shipping label
will be provided to your buyer. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to comply with our [returns
policy](/help/selling/managing-returns-refunds/managing-returns-
refunds?id=4079). [CLS] [SEP]  
when an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize ebay
to request that paypal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency)
from your paypal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your

ebay money back guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve
issues. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final
decision on any ebay money back guarantee case. [CLS] [SEP]  
if you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse
a buyer or ebay under the ebay money back guarantee, you authorize ebay to
request that paypal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other
currency) from your paypal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or
charge your payment method on file. [CLS] [SEP] if we cannot get reimbursement from you,
we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms,
including retaining collection agencies. [CLS] [SEP]  
we may suspend the [ebay money back guarantee](/help/policies/ebay-money-back-
guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210) in whole or in part
without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of
the policy. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **managed payments**  
ebay has launched a new managed payments service, where a designated ebay
entity (each, a "payments entity") manages payments on behalf of sellers (such
management described as "managed payments" or similar). [CLS] [SEP] some ebay sellers have
already enrolled in managed payments. [CLS] [SEP] ebay anticipates moving more seller
accounts to managed payments in phases starting in july 2020, providing notice
to the affected sellers as they are scheduled to be moved. [CLS] [SEP]  
when we enable your account for managed payments, to continue to list and sell
on ebay, as directed by the payments entity, each transitioned ebay seller
registered in the us must:

    * provide the payments entity with information about you and/or your business to meet its compliance requirements, including those involving identity verification, anti-money laundering controls, and sanctions screening as required by applicable laws and policies; and
    * pass such verification and screening and otherwise meet the compliance requirements of the payments entity, as determined by the payments entity; and
    * provide bank account information for a u.s.-based checking account so that the payments entity can link such checking account to your ebay account, allowing the payments entity to pay you
in addition:

    * the payments entity may obtain information about you from third-parties to verify your identity, comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, and for other purposes in connection with managed payments
    * the payments entity may use third-party payments service providers to assist it in providing managed payments services, including companies that process payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance checks, verify identity, and validate payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] ebay, the payments entity, and their affiliates may send personal data associated with you and your account to such third-parties
the payments entity may, in its sole discretion, manage payments on your
behalf even if you haven't provided all requested information, and the
payments entity may withhold payouts pending receipt of such information. [CLS] [SEP]  
the complete terms governing sellers' use of managed payments are available in
the [payments terms of use \- opens in new window or
tab](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html), incorporated herein. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree to the [payments terms of use \- opens in new window or
tab](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html) to the extent applicable
to you, whether or not your account has been enabled for managed payments. [CLS] [SEP]  
the contract for sale underlying the purchase of goods is directly concluded
between seller and the buyer in the same manner as for transactions for which
the payments entity does not manage payments. [CLS] [SEP]  
if you are a buyer completing a purchase from a seller that is using managed
payments:

    * you may pay for such items using those payment methods that the payments entity makes available, and the payments entity will manage settlement to sellers. [CLS] [SEP] by completing purchases from sellers who use managed payments, buyers authorize the payments entity to initiate payments using the buyers' selected payment method and collect the transaction amounts on behalf of sellers. [CLS] [SEP] buyers agree and understand that, with respect to payments transactions initiated on ebay.com, the applicable payments entity is ebay commerce inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("eci"), and that eci has been appointed as an agent of sellers who use managed payments for the limited purpose of accepting such payments on behalf of sellers. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, payments received by eci from buyers satisfy buyers' obligations to pay sellers in the amount of payments received
    * in certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, aml compliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with ebay's internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of ebay or the payments entity, or a policy of one of the payments entity's third party payments services providers
    * ebay, the payments entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered by you on ebay services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any other transaction on ebay services where card information is entered. [CLS] [SEP] such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for future transactions on ebay services. [CLS] [SEP] at any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card information shall be stored as your default payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may make changes to your default payment method through the personal information section under the account tab in my ebay. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to ebay updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. [CLS] [SEP] you will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you may seek returns or cancellations on ebay services, or file ebay money back guarantee claims on ebay services, in the same manner as you do for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments. [CLS] [SEP] the payments entity refunds amounts paid for successful ebay money back guarantee claims and returned or cancelled transactions in cases where the original payment was managed by the payments entity. [CLS] [SEP] refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks
    * you agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of managed payments. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that some third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in connection with managed payments transactions. [CLS] [SEP] failure to abide by third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the payments entity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions

some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of
damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our
liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any
amounts due under the ebay money back guarantee up to the price the item sold

costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which

liability, or (c) $100. [CLS] [SEP]

### release

if you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our
affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or
in any way connected with such disputes. [CLS] [SEP] **in entering into this release you
expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would
otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims
which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing
to this release.**

### indemnity

you will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as
well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents)
harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by
any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement,
your improper use of ebay's services or your breach of any law or the rights
of a third party. [CLS] [SEP]

### legal disputes

**please read this section carefully. [CLS] [SEP] it affects your rights and will have a
substantial impact on how claims you and ebay have against each other are
resolved.**

**you and ebay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has
arisen, or may arise, between you and ebay (including any claim or dispute
between you and a third-party agent of ebay) that relates in any way to or
arises out of this or previous versions of this user agreement, your use of or
access to the services, the actions of ebay or its agents, or any products or
services sold or purchased through the services, will be resolved in
accordance with the provisions set forth in this legal disputes section.**

**a. [CLS] [SEP] applicable law**

you agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal
law, the laws of the state of utah, without regard to principles of conflict
of laws, will govern this user agreement and any claim or dispute that has
arisen or may arise between you and ebay, except as otherwise stated in this
user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] agreement to arbitrate**

**you and ebay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have
arisen, or may arise, between you and ebay (including any disputes or claims
between you and a third-party agent of ebay) that relate in any way to or
arise out of this or previous versions of the user agreement, your use of or
access to the services, the actions of ebay or its agents, or any products or
services sold, offered, or purchased through the services shall be resolved
exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. [CLS] [SEP]
alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your
claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances
only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. [CLS] [SEP] the federal
arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement
to arbitrate.**

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief**

**you and ebay agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only
on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class, or representative or private attorney general action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]
unless both you and ebay agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
or join more than one person 's or party's claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, class, or private
attorney general action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] also, the arbitrator may award relief
(including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). [CLS] [SEP] any relief awarded
cannot affect other users.** if a court decides that applicable law precludes
enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim
for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the
arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and ebay's right to
appeal the court's decision. [CLS] [SEP] all other claims will be arbitrated. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **arbitration procedures**

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration uses a
neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an
arbitration award is very limited. [CLS] [SEP] however, an arbitrator can award the same
damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
individual. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator should apply the terms of the user agreement as a
court would. [CLS] [SEP] all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues
relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this agreement to
arbitrate, or the interpretation of section 1 of this agreement to arbitrate
("prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized
relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association
("aaa") under its rules and procedures, including the aaa's consumer
arbitration rules (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP]
the aaa's rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP] the use
of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit
more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the aaa's
rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an
arbitration conducted under this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP]

a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
certified mail, a completed form notice of dispute ("notice"). [CLS] [SEP] you may
[download a form notice \- opens in new window or
tab](http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/notice_of_dispute.pdf). [CLS] [SEP] the notice
to ebay should be sent to ebay inc., attn: litigation department, re: notice
of dispute, 583 w. [CLS] [SEP] ebay way, draper, ut 84020. [CLS] [SEP] ebay will send any notice to
you to the physical address we have on file associated with your ebay account;
it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. [CLS] [SEP] all
information called for in the notice must be provided, including a description
of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief
sought. [CLS] [SEP]

if you and ebay are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice
within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or ebay may initiate arbitration
proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the
aaa's site at www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to filing this form with the aaa in
accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration
must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. [CLS] [SEP] you may send a
copy to ebay at the following address: ebay, inc. [CLS] [SEP] c/o ct corporation system,
1108 e south union ave., midvale, ut 84047. [CLS] [SEP] in the event ebay initiates an
arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the
physical address we have on file associated with your ebay account. [CLS] [SEP] any
settlement offer made by you or ebay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at
another mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of the relief sought is $10,000
or less, you or ebay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone
or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you
and ebay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person
hearing, if the circumstances warrant. [CLS] [SEP] in cases where an in-person hearing is
held, you and/or ebay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires
otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all
claims of privilege recognized by law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall not be bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same ebay user to the extent
required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding
and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **costs of arbitration**

payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
the aaa's rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if
the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, ebay will
pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] any request for payment of fees by ebay should be submitted by
mail to the aaa along with your demand for arbitration and ebay will make
arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] if (a) you
willfully fail to comply with the notice of dispute requirement discussed
above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert
in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse ebay for all fees
associated with the arbitration paid by ebay on your behalf that you otherwise
would be obligated to pay under the aaa's rules. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] **severability**

with the exception of any of the provisions in section 1 of this agreement to
arbitrate ("prohibition of class and representative actions and non-
individualized relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of
this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of
this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] **opt-out procedure**

**if you are a new user of our services, you can choose to reject this
agreement to arbitrate ( "opt-out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice
("opt-out notice"). [CLS] [SEP] the opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30
days after the date you accept the user agreement for the first time. [CLS] [SEP] you must
mail the opt-out notice to ebay inc., attn: litigation department, re: opt-out
notice, 583 west ebay way, draper, ut 84020.**

for your convenience, we are providing an [opt-out notice form \- opens in new
window or tab](https://pages.ebay.com/policies/arbitrate-optout.html). [CLS] [SEP] you
must complete and mail that to us in order to opt out of the agreement to
arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] you must complete the opt-out notice form by providing the
information called for in the form, including your name, address (including
street address, city, state and zip code), and the user id(s) and email
address(es) associated with the ebay service account(s) to which the opt-out
applies. [CLS] [SEP] you must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. [CLS] [SEP] this
procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if
you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of this user
agreement and its legal disputes section will continue to apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] opting
out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or
future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP]

  6. [CLS] [SEP] **future amendments to the agreement to arbitrate**

notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and
we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate (other
than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the
future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal
proceeding against ebay prior to the effective date of the amendment. [CLS] [SEP] the
amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the
agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and ebay. [CLS] [SEP] we
will notify you of amendments to this agreement to arbitrate by posting the
amended terms on www.ebay.com at least 30 days before the effective date of
the amendments and by providing notice through the ebay message center and/or
by email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your
account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] judicial forum for legal disputes**

unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the agreement to
arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or
dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to
arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you
agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and
ebay must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in salt
lake county, utah. [CLS] [SEP] you and ebay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
of the courts located within salt lake county, utah for the purpose of
litigating all such claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]
