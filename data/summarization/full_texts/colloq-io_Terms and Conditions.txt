**summary:**  
**you undertake to use our services exclusively for legal and authorized

## visitor’s responsibilities

colloq is not able to review all user-generated content and therefore cannot
be held liable for content that we haven’t created. [CLS] [SEP] we do not represent or
endorse content published by others. [CLS] [SEP] it may therefore be possible that the
service contains harassing, offensive, violent content or harmful, destructive
content like viruses or trojans. [CLS] [SEP] colloq may contain content that violates
copyright, laws, publicity rights of third-parties parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you encounter
any such content please [inform us immediately](/contact). [CLS] [SEP]

**summary:**  
**colloq is not responsible for content published by others and cannot be held
liable for any damages caused by such content.**

colloq’s software is hosted in frankfurt, germany. [CLS] [SEP] emails are sent from the
european amazon aws ses location in ireland in order to best protect your data
under european jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] we use a third-party provider to collect payments
for purchases or subscriptions. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to use the external services at your
sole risk. [CLS] [SEP]
