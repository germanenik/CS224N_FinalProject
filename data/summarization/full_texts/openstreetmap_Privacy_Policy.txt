## introduction

this document states the openstreetmap **privacy policy** for services
formally operated and provided by the [openstreetmap foundation
(osmf)](http://osmfoundation.org/). [CLS] [SEP] in particular these are

  * the openstreetmap.org website and associated services and apis,
  * the openstreetmap data distribution,
  * the openstreetmap wiki and help sites,
  * the openstreetmap mailing lists and forums. [CLS] [SEP]

it describes what personal information we may be gathering from you, who can
see this information, and what options you have for controlling this. [CLS] [SEP] we value
your privacy and strive to achieve a balance between the legitimate interests
of the openstreetmap project and your interests and rights. [CLS] [SEP]

this document is mainly intended for openstreetmap contributors, if you are
using services provided by the osmf without contributing, section  data we
receive automatically will be most relevant for you. [CLS] [SEP]

as the osmf has many legacy systems and practices that have currently not been
fully reviewed and documented, it is possible that a subject of particular
interest to you has not been covered yet or is inaccurately described. [CLS] [SEP] please
use the  contact information if you have any such questions or believe that
you have found a discrepancy. [CLS] [SEP] as we will be updating this document regularly
to reflect our better understanding of these issues, please check from time to
time for updates. [CLS] [SEP]

openstreetmap developers, contributors and related companies will often use
the openstreetmap name and logo to set up groups or services on third-party
web sites. [CLS] [SEP] for example, there might be a facebook page, a google plus page, a
slack channel, a page on xing or linkedin, a meetup group, and so on. [CLS] [SEP] the
privacy practices of such services are outside of osmf's control and might be
located in countries with different data protection rules. [CLS] [SEP] data you share on
these platforms cannot, therefore, be covered by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to
the privacy policies of those third-party services. [CLS] [SEP]

## why do we store and process personal data?

the purpose of the openstreetmap project and the osmf is to provide open
geographic data, such as street maps, to anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

to fulfill the goal of distributing data that is truly open, untethered by
rights of third parties and of high quality, we do not support anonymous
contributions and retain additional, non-geographic, data on a legitimate
interest basis (see [gdpr article 6.1f ](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)),
to enable:

  * identifying all the contributions made by an account,
  * contacting the contributor in the case of questions in respect to the nature and source of the contributions,
  * detection, removal and correction of spam accounts, vandallism and violations of the rights of third parties,
  * facilitating the communication between openstreetmap contributors. [CLS] [SEP]
  * research and analysis on aggregate contributions to improve or prioritise osmf services, such as evaluating mapping efficacy, map completeness, determining if locations or mappers are disproportionately represented. [CLS] [SEP]

## what data do we store and process?

### data from contributions to openstreetmap

besides the geographic data contributed (points lines, and areas with
associated attributes and gps trace data), and communications related data
(diary posts and comments, the user page, changeset comments, messages) we
store

  * editing session meta-data. [CLS] [SEP] for example comments added by the user, any version and similar information added by the editing application, which editing application and which aerial imagery layers where used. [CLS] [SEP]
  * user id and login name of the author of every change to an object and a timestamp when that change occured. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the e-mail address associated with your account,
  * any blocks the user has received and associated messages. [CLS] [SEP]
  * network access data (example ip addresses) for the systems and services operated by the osmf. [CLS] [SEP] see  data we receive automatically . [CLS] [SEP]

### osmf membership data

the full personal name and residential address of members of the organisation
according to the companies act are, by law, required to be added to the osmf
register of members. [CLS] [SEP] terminating membership does not lead to the entry being
deleted. [CLS] [SEP] associate members are not required to provide their full details and
the information can be deleted if membership is terminated. [CLS] [SEP] payment details
for both classes of members is retained for accounting purposes as long as
required by law. [CLS] [SEP] the processing of this data is necessary for compliance with
a legal obligation (see [gdpr article 6.1c](https://gdpr-
info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). [CLS] [SEP]

more details on osmf membership options can be found on
<https://join.osmfoundation.org/>. [CLS] [SEP]

### conference and event registration data

some events organized by the osmf require prior registration to be able to
participate, most notably our annual state of the map conference. [CLS] [SEP] this data is
required to verify payment of entry fees, planning of venues, catering and
scheduling of talks and presentations and is visible to the group organizing
the event. [CLS] [SEP] the processing of this data is necessary for the performance of a
contract (see [gdpr article 6.1b](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). [CLS] [SEP]

## who has access to the data

we do not share email addresses associated with accounts with any third party
and they are only accessible to our operations and working group personnel
that have signed confidentiality agreements. [CLS] [SEP] user to user messages are visible
to the sender and recipient, other access is limited to our operations staff
and only if required for operational reasons, to enforce our acceptable use
policies, to fulfil any legal obligations and most notably to prevent spam. [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, network access data is only used for internal purposes and access
is limited to operating personnel for operational and vandalism and spam
protection purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

the other data is made available, depending on the use case, via the website,
via the editing api and from our data dumps, to users with accounts and to the
general public. [CLS] [SEP] some of the non-geographic data may be available only by some
methods however this is subject to change. [CLS] [SEP]

to reduce the distribution of the non-geographic information we offer our data
dumps with and without the additional data. [CLS] [SEP] entities that require and process
the additional data can register with the osmf and you can find contact
information for them here: [registered data
controllers](/wiki/registered_data_controllers "registered data controllers"). [CLS] [SEP]
we do not contract with them and any processing of the data carried out by
such entities is done on their own behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

## where do we store the data

the website, api servers, databases and the servers for auxiliary services are
currently located in the united kingdom and the netherlands. [CLS] [SEP]

map tiles are provided by a global network of cache servers, which tile server
your browser or app access is determined dynamically by geolocation of the ip
address and selection of the cache server "nearest" to you. [CLS] [SEP] while in general
this means that you will be using the tile cache physically nearest to you,
this can be affected by

  * uncertainties in determining the location of the client from its ip address
  * operational issues (server downtime etc)
  * network topology and load

the current list of tile cache servers can be found here:
<https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/#tile-caches> and you can determine which
one is currently being used with the following link
<https://tile.openstreetmap.org/cgi-bin/debug>. [CLS] [SEP]

## how can you control the processing of your data and reduce privacy related
issues

while not required by law, we provide the following mechanism to reduce the
exposure of potentially privacy related information for you. [CLS] [SEP]

  * you can select a non identifying login name and change it at any time you want,
  * you are not required to include personal data in diary posts, comments, email listserv, the wiki, or other osm communications methods, and you may delete diary posts at any time through your account,
  * you can [request your account to be deleted](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/faq#how_can_i_close_my_account.3f) (restrictions see below) and this will be conveyed to registered entities that are using our full data. [CLS] [SEP]

you should not enable gravatar support or use an e-mail address you have
associated with a gravatar with if privacy is a concern. [CLS] [SEP]

you can further reduce exposure by not adding personal information to the map
data (personal names and similar). [CLS] [SEP] such information is in general not
considered to be an useful addition to our data and you should refrain from
adding it. [CLS] [SEP]

## right to object

you have a [right to object](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/) against
processing based on legitimate interests of the data controller. [CLS] [SEP]

## detailed information

### gps trace data

the uploading of gps data is entirely optional and not a prerequisite for
contributions to openstreetmap. [CLS] [SEP] if you do submit gps data, it is uploaded in
the form of individual gpx files. [CLS] [SEP] these are kept as raw files, as well as
imported into the database. [CLS] [SEP] gpx files can be marked
"[public](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/visibility_of_gps_traces)" by
the uploader; this is completely unrelated to the option of making one's
_edits_ "public". [CLS] [SEP]

when gps data for an area is downloaded via the api no indication is provided
of which user uploaded a point, or of the timestamp that was associated with
the point. [CLS] [SEP] points are however returned in timestamp order. [CLS] [SEP] gps data downloaded
in this way will include points from traces which were not marked as public. [CLS] [SEP]

if a gps trace is marked as public when it is uploaded then the raw trace may
be downloaded from the web site or using an api call. [CLS] [SEP] in this case the user's
display name is shown (regardless of whether the user has made their _edits_
public) and the timestamps in the gpx file will be included. [CLS] [SEP] also, any
additional information placed in the gpx file will still be present, e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
waypoints with their names and/or notes entered, associated symbols, elevation
data, etc. [CLS] [SEP] you should remove any such information from the data and trim
enough information from beginning and end of the trace to obscure start and
destination before uploading it if you have privacy concerns

### map data

all edits made to the map are recorded in the database with the user id of the
user making the change, and a timestamp at the time of change upload. [CLS] [SEP] in
general all of this information is also made available to everyone via the
website, including links to allow everyone to easily cross-reference which
user has made which edit. [CLS] [SEP]

editing programs (such as josm and id) can store further data in the database
that may be relevant to your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to the respective authors
and distributors of the programs for more information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, id and
josm may add the language settings of your device to the metadata of each
changeset and the make and operating system of the device may be visible from
the transmitted version strings. [CLS] [SEP]

### user 'home' location

if a user sets a home location then they will appear on the "nearby mappers"
list for other people with a home location near theirs. [CLS] [SEP] this is an option on
your account settings page. [CLS] [SEP]

### email addresses

the registered email address for an osm user account will never intentionally
be published on the internet anywhere, shared with third party organisations,
or revealed directly to other users. [CLS] [SEP] email addresses will be used by the
server to notify the user if another user has sent a message through the
website, and for other system generated notifications. [CLS] [SEP]

only [system
administrators](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/system_administrators)
will have direct access to email address data associated with the osm account. [CLS] [SEP]
it may be used by these people to contact users directly about their edits or
other openstreetmap related issues. [CLS] [SEP]

email addresses associated with wiki, forum and help site accounts are stored
separately from the osm user account data in the respective systems. [CLS] [SEP] these
address are used for notifications and user to user communication (if
enabled). [CLS] [SEP] these addresses are not publicly visible or shared with third
parties, but may be visible to the administrators of the systems. [CLS] [SEP]

note that some other types of
[accounts](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/accounts) used by
developers/community do expose email address information more publicly (due to
technical limitations of the software used, rather than policy decisions). [CLS] [SEP] the
trac system exposes your email address in plaintext on the page if the email
address (rather than the display name) is used to login. [CLS] [SEP] the mailing list
system exposes email addresses of people posting messages to everyone who
receives the message, as well as in the archive web pages. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to post
to the list, the system also requires you to register with your proper 'from'
address, not a forwarding address. [CLS] [SEP]

#### gravatar

the openstreetmap.org website supports the display of
[gravatars](http://gravatar.com/), these are retrieved from gravatar.com by
generating a globally unique key from your e-mail address. [CLS] [SEP] our website
software will check on the initial signup and on every email address change if
you have a gravatar for the new address and start displaying it if one exists. [CLS] [SEP]
you can stop this behaviour by explicitly turning gravatar support off in your
account settings. [CLS] [SEP] you should be aware that, if a gravatar is displayed, the
key can be used to track your account over any website that has gravatar
support. [CLS] [SEP]

### surveys

the foundation may from time to time conduct surveys, both of the foundation
membership and of others, including the broader openstreetmap community, in
order to determine the opinions of foundation membership, the openstreetmap
community, and others, and better to serve the members and the community, a
legitimate purpose of the foundation. [CLS] [SEP] distributing surveys and processing
their results may require the use of personal data such as names and email
addresses. [CLS] [SEP] personal data gathered or used in connection with surveys will be
processed in accordance with applicable data privacy laws and will be retained
only as long as reasonably necessary. [CLS] [SEP]

email addresses of members of the osmf may be used to invite foundation
members to participate in surveys. [CLS] [SEP]

if survey data are made publicly available (for instance, for analysis by the
osm- or research communities at large) the data will be anonymized. [CLS] [SEP] if the
anonymized data are organized in such a fashion that individuals might be
reasonably identifiable (for instance, a group with few individuals that is
identifiable with a specific geography or function) the grouping will be
merged to deter identification. [CLS] [SEP] further, the foundation board reserves the
right to exclude from public release any variables that might permit
deanonymization of the data. [CLS] [SEP]

anonymized survey data, which may be useful to the foundation in the future
for comparison purposes, may be retained indefinitely in accordance with
applicable data privacy laws. [CLS] [SEP]

### data you may voluntarily add to your profile or diary posts

you are not required to fill out your profile or make diary posts. [CLS] [SEP] by
voluntarily entering personal data in your user profile or diary posts, you
consent to that information being publicly available and stored by osmf as
long as you maintain an osm account. [CLS] [SEP] you may edit your public profile or your
diary posts at any time to remove such information if you change your mind. [CLS] [SEP]

### data we receive automatically

the osmf operates a number of services for the openstreetmap community,
examples are the openstreetmap.org website, the "standard" style online map,
the osm api and the nominatim search facility. [CLS] [SEP]

when you visit an osmf website, access any of the services via a browser or
via applications that utilize the provided apis, records of that use are
produced, we collect information about your browser or application and your
interaction with our website, including (a) ip address, (b) browser and device
type, (c) operating system, (d) referring web page, (e) the date and time of
page visits, and (f) the pages accessed on our websites. [CLS] [SEP]

further we may operate user interaction tracking software that will generate
additional records of user activity, for example piwik. [CLS] [SEP]

services that use geo-dns or similar mechanisms to distribute load to
geographically distributed servers will potentially generate a record of your
location at a large scale (for example the osmf tile cache network determines
the country you are likely to be located in and directs your requests to an
appropriate server). [CLS] [SEP]

these records are used or can be used in the following ways:

  * in support of the operation of the services from a technical, security and planning point of view. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as anonymised, summarised data for research and other purposes. [CLS] [SEP] such data may be offered publicly via <https://planet.openstreetmap.org> or other channels and used by 3rd parties. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to improve the openstreetmap dataset. [CLS] [SEP] for example by analysing nominatim queries for missing addresses and postcodes and providing such data to the osm community. [CLS] [SEP]

the data collected on the systems will be accessible by the system
administrators and the appropriate osmf working groups, for example the data
working group. [CLS] [SEP] no personal information or information that is linked to an
individual will be released to third parties, except as required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

ip addresses stored by piwik are shortened to two bytes and detailed usage
information is retained for 180 days. [CLS] [SEP]

given the temporary nature of this storage, it is generally not feasible for
us to provide access to ip addresses or the logs associated with them. [CLS] [SEP]

the above mentioned data is processed on a legitimate interest basis (see
[gdpr article 6.1f ](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). [CLS] [SEP]

### third party provided services and data

third party services providing content linked to via or third party javascript
files utilised by osmf provided sites are not covered by this policy and you
will need to refer to the respective service providers for more information. [CLS] [SEP]
using these services will typically transmit at least your internet address
and browser information to the operators. [CLS] [SEP]

these are specifically

    

  * cycle and transport map layers available via the openstreetmap.org website operated by [gravitystorm limited, new malden, united kingdom](http://www.thunderforest.com/contact/)
  * humanitarian map layer available via the openstreetmap.org website operated by the [openstreetmap france c/o maison des associations du 2ème arrondissement, 23 rue greneta, 75002 paris](http://openstreetmap.fr/contact)
  * overpass-api used by the query function on the openstreetmap.org website operated by [fossgis e.v., römerweg 5, 79199 kirchzarten, germany](https://www.fossgis.de/datenschutzerklaerung)
  * 3rd party service integrations in editing applications available from openstreetmap.org: 
    * background layers, see the [editor layer index](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index) for information on the operators of the numerous imagery layers. [CLS] [SEP]
    * mapillary street-level imagery is provided by mapillary ab, bredgatan 4, 211 30 malmö, sweden, [privacy policy](https://www.mapillary.com/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]
    * openstreetcam street-level imagery is provided by telenav, inc. [CLS] [SEP] usa, [privacy policy](https://www.skobbler.com/legal#privacyprivacy). [CLS] [SEP]
  * gravatar images in user profiles that display these are provided by aut o’mattic a8c ireland ltd., business centre, no.1 lower mayor street, international financial services centre, dublin 1, ireland [privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/)

### communication via osmf provided systems

the osm community uses a number of channels for public and inter-personal
communication. [CLS] [SEP] some of the systems are operated and controlled by third
parties and can be located in countries other than the uk. [CLS] [SEP] you will need to
refer to the respective service providers for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

these 3rd party operated systems are:

  * mailboxes for the osmf e-mail addresses are provided by google llc, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043. [CLS] [SEP] usa
  * irc channels on the [oftc network](https://www.oftc.net/)
  * openstreetmap organisation and source code repositories on [github](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/)

by using those systems that are provided by the osmf, for example the
messaging system on openstreetmap.org, you agree to your communications being
intercepted by osmf system managers when necessary to address operational
issues, to enforce our acceptable use policies, most notably to prevent spam,
and to fulfil any legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

you should be aware of the above when communicating sensitive information and
you should employ encryption to protect your communications content. [CLS] [SEP]

### account removal

you can [request your account to be
removed](//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/faq#how_can_i_close_my_account.3f) and
we will honor such requests as far as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have not actively contributed to the project we will not retain any
records, user page, diary posts and similar will be removed. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have contributed your account will be renamed to user_ _userid_ and
contributions and changeset comments will be retained with this name, diary
entries and your user page will be removed. [CLS] [SEP] since we do not allow anonymous
edits we will non-publicly retain your email address in case you need to be
contacted with respect to your contributions. [CLS] [SEP]

wiki and forum accounts will be renamed to a pseudo-anonymous name, but
otherwise will remain as is. [CLS] [SEP] you can unsubscribe yourself from any mailing
lists, however you need to realize that personal copies held by the recipients
of any mails you sent to the lists and the archives on lists.openstreetmap.org
can not be removed. [CLS] [SEP]

in your request for account removal you need to identify all accounts that are
affected as we do not have information on which accounts belong to which
openstreetmap id. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies

numerous osmf operated services use cookies to store information on your login
and site navigation state. [CLS] [SEP] we also use cookies and similar technologies to
recognize and improve your use of our websites.. [CLS] [SEP] you may delete cookies from
your computer, and most browsers provide the option to block them. [CLS] [SEP] if you
block cookies placed by us (first party cookies), you will not be able to
access parts of the osmf websites and services that require a login. [CLS] [SEP] however,
your access to our websites will not be affected if you disable cookies placed
by third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

## other relevant policies

as well as privacy issues, users and contributors must also be aware of the
[openstreetmap license](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). [CLS] [SEP] this includes
[disclaimers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/disclaimer). [CLS] [SEP] we also have an
[acceptable use
policy](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/acceptable_use_policy) covering
various types of server usage. [CLS] [SEP]

## contact

if you have questions or concerns with respect to this policy, please contact
the osmf via our [contact
channels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/contact_channels). [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that we hold information that would allow us to correct, amend,
or delete inaccurate information about you or if you believe that information
about you has been processed in violation of this privacy policy please email
