**cookies and similar technologies**

we use cookies and similar technologies (including device identifiers) in
relation to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

### what are cookies?

a cookie is a small text file that is generated by a website, including the
site, and is stored on your device. [CLS] [SEP] when you access the site, a number of
cookies used by newegg and third parties are sent to your browser and stored
on your device. [CLS] [SEP] when you next visit the site, newegg and the third parties
will use this information to recognise and remember your device. [CLS] [SEP] third parties
may also use this to recognise you when you are on other websites and mobile
applications. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are useful for a variety of purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for example, they allow you to
navigate between pages efficiently and allow us to remember preferences and
generally improve your user experience. [CLS] [SEP] they are also used to tailor
advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, when you view certain products on our site or have interacted
with certain pages on our site, we may use this information to show you
advertisements which may interest you. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, third parties that place
cookies on our site may use this type of information to present you with
tailored advertising when you other their websites. [CLS] [SEP]

session cookies are deleted when you close your browser. [CLS] [SEP] persistent cookies
remain on your device after you close your browser. [CLS] [SEP] cookies set by newegg are
first-party cookies. [CLS] [SEP] cookies set by third parties are third-party cookies. [CLS] [SEP]
please note that newegg has no access to or control over third-party
technologies and information about their data collection practices should be
found on their respective websites. [CLS] [SEP]

### what cookies does newegg use?

we describe below the categories of cookies that are set by newegg and its
partners when you visit the site. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **strictly necessary cookies**  
these cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the site and
use its features and cannot be turned off. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, services you
have asked for (such as navigating between pages, placing an order and using a
shopping cart or e-billing services) cannot be provided. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you cannot
disable these cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **performance cookies**  
we make use of performance cookies to analyse how our visitors use the site
and to monitor the site’s performance. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to provide a high
quality experience by customising our offering, and quickly identifying and
fixing any issues that arise. [CLS] [SEP]  
for example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are
most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to
determine why some pages are receiving error messages. [CLS] [SEP] we might also use these
cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of
interest to you based on your usage of the site. [CLS] [SEP] the information collected by
these cookies is not associated with your personal data by us or by our
contractors. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **functional cookies**  
these cookies are used to provide you with certain functionality on the site. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, to improve the performance of our services and the site, to
maintain security on the site and to prevent and detect fraud, to customise
your account, to display certain web page content based upon your browser type
and other device information. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] **advertising cookies**  
subject to your cookie settings, newegg and various third party ad partners
may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about
the browsing habits associated with your device to further personalise your
experience such as through the use of targeted advertisements and special
offers that are more relevant to you and your interests. [CLS] [SEP]  
we allow some third parties, including facebook to set cookies both when you
visit our site and when you use certain features on our site (such as clicking
“like”, “share” and “tweet” buttons). [CLS] [SEP]  
these third parties link the information that they collect through the use of
these cookies with the information that they hold about you through your use
of their service in order to present you with targeted advertising via their
platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for example, where you have provided permission, we allow facebook
to place a cookie on your device. [CLS] [SEP] when you return to facebook, facebook can
identify you as a user of the newegg site and can therefore provide you with
advertising messages from us. [CLS] [SEP]  
in other situations, third parties use cookies so that they can retarget
newegg’s products to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications,
or to predict what advertisements about third party products are likely to be
of interest to you based on your browsing activities. [CLS] [SEP]  
please note that if you opt out of advertising cookies, you will still be
presented with advertisements online. [CLS] [SEP] these advertisements will just not be
tailored to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### other tracking technologies

in conjunction with cookies, we may utilise other tracking technologies to
understand how you access and use our site and services. [CLS] [SEP] these tracking
technologies may include:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **log files and ip addresses**  
we use device information and ip addresses (and ask for confirmation if this
is correct) to analyse trends, administer the site, track user movement, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. [CLS] [SEP] an ip address is a
numeric code that identifies your computer on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] we may store the
information in log files (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] files which record events), or other types of
files, which may be combined with other information that we have collected
about you. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **web beacons and pixels**  
the site and our emails and advertisements may contain web beacons. [CLS] [SEP] a web
beacon is a small graphic image, such as a pixel or gif, which is placed on a
web page, email, or advertisement and is used to provide information on when
and how you access and use the site, and services and emails. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this
information for various purposes, including to develop statistical information
and to determine features that most interest you for the purpose of providing
more personalized content. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to emails, we may use this information
to determine which of our emails are more interesting to you and to whether
you wish to continue receiving such emails if you do not open them. [CLS] [SEP] the pixel
will be deleted when you delete the email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish the pixel to be
downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in
plain text rather than html, and you should not click links that we send you. [CLS] [SEP]
you can opt-out of receiving marketing emails by clicking the “unsubscribe”
link located at the bottom of all newegg marketing emails or by sending an
email to [wecare@service.newegg.com](mailto:wecare@service.newegg.com) with a
request to be removed, or by contacting us as per section 1 above. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
a registered user of the site, you can also opt-out of receiving marketing
emails by updating your email preferences under the "email notifications"
section of [my
account](https://secure.newegg.com/newmyaccount/emailnotifications.aspx). [CLS] [SEP]
please allow up to thirty (30) days for your request to be processed. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing emails, you may still
receive communications from us that are important and/or related to your
interactions with us, or otherwise as required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **apps – sdks and ad-ids**  
we also use software development kits (sdks) and advertising ids (ad-ids)
which function like pixels and cookies in our mobile app. [CLS] [SEP] these sdks may
include third party code that allows the third party partner to collect
information about your interaction with the app and information about your
device and network information generally for advertising purposes or to assist
us analysing how our apps are used. [CLS] [SEP]

we may link data stored in cookies or collected by similar tracking
technologies to other personal data we collect about you as you use the site. [CLS] [SEP]

### "do not track signals"

some web browsers have a "do not track" feature that, when turned on, signals
to websites the user visits that the user does not want to be tracked. [CLS] [SEP] at this
time, the site does not respond to “do not track” signals or similar
mechanisms. [CLS] [SEP]

### consent

in some countries, by using the site, you consent to the use of cookies and
other similar tracking technologies in accordance with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in other countries, we are required to collect your consent for many of the
cookies and tracking technologies we use. [CLS] [SEP] where this is the case, you will
have seen a pop- up to this effect on your first visit to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

although the pop-up may not usually appear on subsequent visits, you may
withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions below. [CLS] [SEP]

### managing and disabling cookies on the site and on our app

how to do this). [CLS] [SEP] please note that some of the uses of the site and the
services provided on the site may not function if cookies are disabled. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use a smart phone, you can usually prevent cross-site tracking and
block cookies in the settings section on your device. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to
visit websites without leaving a history by turning private browsing on. [CLS] [SEP] you
should visit the support section of the website of your device for more
information on how to do this. [CLS] [SEP]

that allows advertisers to track you across websites and apps on mobile) with
us or third party partners. [CLS] [SEP] for information on controlling your mobile choices
in respect of advertising tracking you can visit
[networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices](www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-
