where you provide consent, we share your information as described at the time
of consent, such as when authorizing a third-party application or website to
access your airbnb account or participating in promotional activities by
airbnb partners or third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] when you as a host have a confirmed booking, certain information is shared with the guest (and the additional guests they invite, if applicable) to coordinate the booking, such as your profile, full name, phone number, and listing address. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you as a host invite another member to host with you, you authorize that person to access and update your information and member content, including but not limited to certain information like your full name, phone number, accommodation address, calendar, listing information, listing photos, and email address. [CLS] [SEP]

we may display parts of your public profile and other content you make

third-party search engines. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, you may opt-out of this feature in
your account settings. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.4 host service providers**. [CLS] [SEP]

hosts may use third-party services to help manage or deliver their services,
such as cleaning services or lock providers. [CLS] [SEP] hosts may use features on the
airbnb platform to share information about the guest (like check-in and check-
out dates, guest name, guest phone number) with such third-party service
providers. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.5 complying with law, responding to legal requests, preventing harm and
protecting our rights**. [CLS] [SEP]

we may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or
public authorities, tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to
the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is
reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply
with a valid legal request or to respond to claims asserted against airbnb,
(iii) to respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation
to address alleged or suspected illegal activity, or to respond to or address
any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal
or regulatory liability (more information on airbnb’s law enforcement
guidelines [here](/help/article/960/how-does-airbnb-respond-to-data-requests-
from-law-enforcement)), (iv) to enforce and administer our

personal safety of airbnb, its employees, its members, or members of the
public. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, host tax
information may be shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies. [CLS] [SEP]

where appropriate, we may notify members about legal requests unless: (i)
providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we
receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would
be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an
individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon or harm to
airbnb, our members, or expose airbnb to a claim of obstruction of justice. [CLS] [SEP]

for jurisdictions where airbnb facilitates the collection and remittance of
taxes where legally permissible according to applicable law, we may disclose
hosts’ and guests’ information about transactions, bookings, accommodations
and occupancy taxes to the applicable tax authority, such as host and guest
names, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification
number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by hosts from guests, and
contact information. [CLS] [SEP]

in jurisdictions where airbnb facilitates or requires a registration,
notification, permit, or license application of a host with a local
governmental authority through airbnb in accordance with local law, we may
share information of participating hosts with the relevant authority, both
during the application process and, periodically thereafter, such as the
host’s full name and contact details, accommodation address, tax
identification number, listing details, and number of nights booked. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.6 programs with managers and owners**. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share personal information of hosts and guests such as booking
information, and information related to compliance with applicable laws such

programs with building management. [CLS] [SEP] for example, guest booking and personal
information, including guest contact information, may be shared with the

and/or the listing is located, to facilitate hosting services, compliance with
applicable laws, security, billing, and other services. [CLS] [SEP]

if a booking is designated as being for business or work purpose and (1) is
made by a guest affiliated with an enterprise, (2) the enterprise is enrolled
in airbnb for work, we may disclose information related to the booking to the
enterprise (e.g., name of the host, accommodation address, booking dates,
listing details, etc.) to the extent necessary for the adequate performance of
airbnb’s contract with the enterprise and to provide the services. [CLS] [SEP] at the
request of the enterprise or the guest, we may also share this information
with third parties engaged by the enterprise to provide support services. [CLS] [SEP]

reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may
sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information
