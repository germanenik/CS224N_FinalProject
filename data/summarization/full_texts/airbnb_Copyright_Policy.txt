please read them carefully.**

last updated: october 30, 2020

thank you for using airbnb!

these terms of service (“ **terms** ”) are a binding legal agreement between
you and airbnb that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other
offerings from airbnb (collectively, the “ **airbnb platform** ”). [CLS] [SEP] when used
in these terms, “ **airbnb** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ” refers
to the airbnb entity set out on schedule 1 with whom you are contracting. [CLS] [SEP]

the airbnb platform offers an online venue that enables users (“ **members**
”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. [CLS] [SEP] members who publish and
offer services are “ **hosts** ” and members who search for, book, or use
services are “ **guests**.” hosts offer accommodations (“ **accommodations**
”), activities, excursions, and events (“ **experiences** ”), and a variety of
travel and other services (collectively, “ **host services** ,” and each host
service offering, a “ **listing** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you must register an account to access
and use many features of the airbnb platform, and must keep your account
information accurate. [CLS] [SEP] as the provider of the airbnb platform, airbnb does not
own, control, offer or manage any listings or host services. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not a
party to the contracts concluded directly between hosts and guests, nor is
airbnb a real estate broker or insurer. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not acting as an agent in
any capacity for any member, except as specified in the [payments terms of
service](/terms/payments_terms) (“ **payment terms** ”). [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about
airbnb’s role see section 16. [CLS] [SEP]

we maintain other [terms and policies](/help/topic/250/terms-policies) that
supplement these terms like our [privacy policy](/terms/privacy_policy), which
describes our collection and use of personal data, and our [payments
terms](/terms/payments_terms), which govern any payment services provided to
members by the airbnb payment entities (" **airbnb payments** "). [CLS] [SEP]

if you host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all
laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your
host services. [CLS] [SEP]

## guest terms

**1\. [CLS] [SEP] our mission**. [CLS] [SEP]

our mission is to create a world where you can belong anywhere. [CLS] [SEP] from cabins to
castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of listings to find the
ones that fit the way you like to travel. [CLS] [SEP] learn more about a listing by
reviewing the description and photos, the host profile, and guest reviews. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have questions, just message the host. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] searching and booking on airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.1 searching**. [CLS] [SEP] you can search for host services by using criteria like the
type of host service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. [CLS] [SEP]
you can also use filters to refine your search results. [CLS] [SEP] search results are
based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. [CLS] [SEP] relevance
considers factors like price, availability, reviews, customer service and
cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved listings, host
requirements (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] minimum or maximum nights), and more. [CLS] [SEP] learn more about
search results in our [help center](/help/article/39/what-factors-determine-
how-my-listing-appears-in-search-results). [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2 booking**. [CLS] [SEP] when you book a listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges
for your booking including the listing price, applicable fees like [airbnb’s
service fee](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees), [offline
fees](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person), [taxes](/help/article/318/how-do-taxes-work-for-guests), and any
other items identified during checkout (collectively, “ **total price** ”). [CLS] [SEP]
you are also agreeing that airbnb payments may charge and collect any
[security deposit](/help/article/140/how-does-airbnb-handle-security-deposits)
identified during checkout. [CLS] [SEP] when you receive the booking confirmation, a
contract for host services (sometimes called a reservation in these terms) is
formed directly between you and the host. [CLS] [SEP] the cancellation policy and any
other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the listing or
during checkout form part of your contract with the host. [CLS] [SEP] be aware that some
hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their host services. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.3 accommodation reservations**. [CLS] [SEP] an accommodation reservation is a limited
license to enter, occupy, and use the accommodation. [CLS] [SEP] the host retains the
right to re-enter the accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is
reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the host, and (iii)
consistent with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you stay past checkout, the host has the
right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including
by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. [CLS] [SEP] you may not exceed the maximum
number of allowed guests. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.4 reservations for experiences and other host services**. [CLS] [SEP] an experience or
other host service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use
that host service. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you
invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for informing the host of any medical or physical conditions, or
other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or
use the host service. [CLS] [SEP] except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any
person to join a host service unless they are included as an additional guest
during the booking process. [CLS] [SEP]

**3\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations, travel issues, refunds and booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.1 cancellations, travel issues, and refunds**. [CLS] [SEP] in general, if as a guest
you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the
[cancellation policy](/home/cancellation_policies) that applies to that
reservation. [CLS] [SEP] but, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and
determine what amount is refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP] if something outside your control
forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full
refund under our [extenuating circumstances policy](/help/article/1320/what-
if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance). [CLS] [SEP] if
the host cancels, or you experience a travel issue (as defined in our [guest
refund policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy)), you may be eligible for rebooking
assistance or a partial or full refund under the [guest refund
policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy). [CLS] [SEP] different policies apply to certain
categories of listings; for example experiences reservations are governed by
the [experiences guest refund policy](/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-
refund-policy). [CLS] [SEP] see each [policy](/help/topic/250/terms-policies) for details
about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.2 booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP] guests and hosts are responsible for any
booking modifications they agree to make via the airbnb platform or direct
airbnb customer service to make on their behalf (" **booking modifications**
"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with
any booking modification. [CLS] [SEP]

**4\. [CLS] [SEP] your responsibilities and assumption of risk**. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.1 your responsibilities**. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible and liable for your own
acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of
anyone you invite to join or provide access to any accommodation, experience
or other host service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, this means: (i) you are responsible for
leaving an accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it
was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others
with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. [CLS] [SEP] if you are booking
for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a host
service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you
are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.2 your assumption of risk**. [CLS] [SEP] **you acknowledge that many activities carry
inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the
airbnb platform and any content (as defined in section 10), including your
stay at any accommodation, participation in any experience, use of any other
host service, or any other interaction you have with other members whether in
person or online. [CLS] [SEP] this means it is your responsibility to investigate a host
service to determine whether it is suitable for you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, host
services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and
you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in
those host services.**

## host terms

**5\. [CLS] [SEP] hosting on airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.1 host**. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your
accommodation, experience, or other host service with our vibrant community of
guests - and earn money doing it. [CLS] [SEP] it’s easy to create a listing and you are in
control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each
listing. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.2 contracting with guests**. [CLS] [SEP] when you accept a booking request, or receive
a booking confirmation through the airbnb platform, you are entering into a
contract directly with the guest, and are responsible for delivering your host
service under the terms and at the price specified in your listing. [CLS] [SEP] you are
also agreeing to pay applicable fees like [airbnb’s service
fee](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees) (and applicable
[taxes](/help/article/481/how-do-taxes-work-for-hosts)) for each booking. [CLS] [SEP]
airbnb payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you
agree to a different method. [CLS] [SEP] any terms, policies or conditions that you
include in any supplemental contract with guests must: (i) be consistent with
these terms, our [policies](/help/topic/250/terms-policies), and the
information provided in your listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in
your listing description. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.3 independence of hosts**. [CLS] [SEP] your relationship with airbnb is that of an
independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer,
or partner of airbnb, except that airbnb payments acts as a payment collection
agent as described in the payments terms. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb does not direct or control
your host service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and
when to provide host services, and at what price and on what terms to offer
them. [CLS] [SEP]

**6\. [CLS] [SEP] managing your listing**. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.1 creating and managing your listing**. [CLS] [SEP] the airbnb platform provides tools
that make it easy for you to set up and manage a listing. [CLS] [SEP] your listing must
include complete and accurate information about your host service, your price,
other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, [offline
fees](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person), and any rules or requirements that apply to your guests or listing. [CLS] [SEP]
you are responsible for keeping your listing information (including calendar
availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. [CLS] [SEP]
we recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your host services and
suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage
details and exclusions. [CLS] [SEP] you may only maintain one listing per accommodation,
but may have multiple listings for a single property if it has multiple places
to stay. [CLS] [SEP] any offer of an experience is subject to our [additional terms for
experience hosts](/experiences/terms-of-service). [CLS] [SEP]

**6.2 know your legal obligations**. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for understanding and
complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties
that apply to your listing or host services. [CLS] [SEP] for example: some landlords and
leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit
subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. [CLS] [SEP] some cities have
zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential
properties. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions require hosts to register, get a permit, or
obtain a license before providing certain host services (such as short-term
rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding
tours, or operating a vehicle). [CLS] [SEP] in some places, the host services you want to
offer may be prohibited altogether. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions require that you
register guests who stay at your accommodation. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions have laws
that create tenancy rights for guests and additional obligations for hosts. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws
that may apply to longer stays. [CLS] [SEP] check your local rules to learn what rules
apply to the host services you plan to offer. [CLS] [SEP] information we provide regarding
legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should
independently confirm your obligations. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for handling and
using personal data of guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy
laws and these terms, including our [host privacy
standards](/help/article/2862/). [CLS] [SEP] if you have questions about how local laws
apply you should always seek legal advice. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.3 search ranking**. [CLS] [SEP] the ranking of listings in search results on the
airbnb platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main
parameters:

  * guest search parameters (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] number of guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),
  * listing characteristics (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, reviews, type of host service, host status, age of the listing, average guest popularity),
  * guest booking experience (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] customer service and cancellation history of the host, ease of booking), 
  * host requirements (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and
  * guest preferences (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] previous trips, saved listings, location from where the guest is searching). [CLS] [SEP]

search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear
on our website. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may allow hosts to promote their listings in search or
elsewhere on the airbnb platform by paying an additional fee. [CLS] [SEP] more information
about the factors that determine how your listing appears in search results,
our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted
content can be found in our [help center](/help/article/39/what-factors-
determine-how-my-listing-appears-in-search-results). [CLS] [SEP]

**6.4 your responsibilities**. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible and liable for your own
acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of
anyone you allow to participate in providing your host services. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for
your listing. [CLS] [SEP] you must describe any and all fees and charges in your listing
description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the
airbnb platform except those expressly authorized by our [offline fee
policy](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person). [CLS] [SEP] do not encourage guests to create third-party accounts, submit
reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the
airbnb platform in violation of our [off-platform
policy](/help/article/2799/airbnbs-offplatform-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

**6.5 hosting as a team or organization**. [CLS] [SEP] if you work with a co-host or host
as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each
individual who participates in providing host services is responsible and
liable as a host under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you accept terms or enter into
contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into
contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that
each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it
is established. [CLS] [SEP] if you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that
you are authorized to perform those functions. [CLS] [SEP] if you instruct airbnb to
transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other hosts, or to send
payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible
and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you
provide. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.6 your assumption of risk**. [CLS] [SEP] **you acknowledge that hosting carries
inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your
access to and use of the airbnb platform, offering host services, or any
interaction you have with other members whether in person or online. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that you have had the opportunity to investigate the airbnb platform and any
laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your
listings or host services and that you are not relying upon any statement of
law made by airbnb.**

**7\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations, travel issues, and booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP]

**7.1 cancellations and travel issues**. [CLS] [SEP] in general, if a guest cancels a
reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy
that applies to that reservation. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, you should not cancel on a guest
without a valid reason under our [extenuating circumstances
policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-an-emergency-
or-unavoidable-circumstance) or applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel on a guest
without such a valid reason, we may impose a [cancellation fee and other
consequences](/help/article/990/as-a-host-what-penalties-apply-if-i-cancel-a-
reservation-for-a-stay). [CLS] [SEP] if: (i) a guest experiences a travel issue (as
defined by the [guest refund policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy)), (ii) an
[extenuating circumstance](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-
because-of-an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance) arises, or (iii) a
reservation is cancelled under section 13 of these terms, the amount you are
paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the
guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the
cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] if a guest receives a refund after you have already been paid,
or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by airbnb exceeds your
payout, airbnb (via airbnb payments) may recover that amount from you,
including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
airbnb’s [guest refund policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy), [extenuating
circumstances policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-
an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance), and these terms preempt the
cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the
cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to guests. [CLS] [SEP] if we
reasonably expect to provide a refund to a guest under one of these policies,
we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund
decision is made. [CLS] [SEP] if you host an experience please note that the [experience
cancellation policy](/experiences/cancellation-policy), [experiences guest
refund policy](/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-refund-policy) and
different [cancellation fees and consequences](/help/article/2039/as-an-
experience-host-what-happens-if-i-need-to-cancel-an-instance-of-an-experience)
apply to your reservations. [CLS] [SEP] see each [policy](/help/topic/250/terms---
policies) for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in
each situation. [CLS] [SEP]

**7.2 booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP] hosts and guests are responsible for any
booking modifications they agree to make via the airbnb platform or direct
airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any
additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a booking modification. [CLS] [SEP]

**8\. [CLS] [SEP] taxes**. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.1 host taxes**. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, you are responsible for determining and
fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit,
or include in your price any applicable vat or other indirect taxes, occupancy
taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes (" **taxes** "). [CLS] [SEP]

**8.2 collection and remittance by airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP] in jurisdictions where airbnb
facilitates the collection and/or remittance of taxes on behalf of hosts, you
instruct and authorize airbnb to collect taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit
such taxes to the relevant tax authority. [CLS] [SEP] any taxes that are collected and/or
remitted by airbnb are identified to members on their transaction records, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may seek additional amounts from members (including by
deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the taxes
collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that members’
tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for taxes collected by
airbnb is a refund from the applicable tax authority. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and
agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected members, to
cease the collection and remittance of taxes in any jurisdiction for any
reason. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.3 tax information**. [CLS] [SEP] in certain jurisdictions, tax regulations may require
that we collect and/or report tax information about you, or withhold taxes
from payouts to you, or both. [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to provide us with documentation
that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold
taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as
required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for vat,
gst, consumption or other taxes for your host services to facilitate accurate
tax reporting by you, our guests, and/or their organizations. [CLS] [SEP]

## general terms

**9\. [CLS] [SEP] reviews**. [CLS] [SEP]

after each host service, guests and hosts will have an opportunity to review
each other. [CLS] [SEP] your review must be accurate and may not contain any
discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our
[content policy](/help/article/546/what-is-airbnb-s-content-policy) or [review
policy](/help/article/2673/airbnbs-review-policy). [CLS] [SEP] reviews are not verified by
airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading. [CLS] [SEP]

**10\. [CLS] [SEP] content**. [CLS] [SEP]

parts of the airbnb platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos,
audio, video, information, and other content (collectively, “ **content** ”). [CLS] [SEP]
by providing content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant
airbnb a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-
licensable and transferable license to copy, modify, prepare derivative works
of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that content, without
limitation. [CLS] [SEP] if content includes personal information, our [privacy
policy](/terms/privacy_policy) describes how we use that personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
where airbnb pays for the creation of content or facilitates its creation,
airbnb may own that content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures
will say that. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for all content that you provide and
warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant airbnb the rights
described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible and liable if any of your
content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of
any third party. [CLS] [SEP] content must comply with our [content
policy](/help/article/546/what-is-airbnb-s-content-policy) and
[nondiscrimination policy](/terms/nondiscrimination_policy), which prohibit,
among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent,
and illegal content. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that airbnb may make available services or
automated tools to translate content and that your content may be translated
using such services or tools. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or
quality of translations and members are responsible for confirming the
accuracy of such translations. [CLS] [SEP]

**11\. [CLS] [SEP] fees**. [CLS] [SEP]

airbnb may charge fees (and applicable taxes) to hosts and guests for use of
the airbnb platform. [CLS] [SEP] more information about when service fees apply and how
they are calculated can be found on our [service fees
page](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees). [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise
provided on the airbnb platform, service fees are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb
reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide
members notice of any fee changes before they become effective. [CLS] [SEP] fee changes
will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change. [CLS] [SEP]
if you disagree with a fee change you may terminate this agreement at any time
pursuant to section 13.2. [CLS] [SEP]

**12\. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb platform rules**. [CLS] [SEP]

**12.1 rules**. [CLS] [SEP] you must follow these rules and must not help or induce others
to break or circumvent these rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**13\. [CLS] [SEP] termination, suspension and other measures**. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.1 term**. [CLS] [SEP] the agreement between you and airbnb reflected by these terms
is effective when you access the airbnb platform (for example to create an
account) and remains in effect until either you or we terminate the agreement
in accordance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.2 termination**. [CLS] [SEP] you may terminate this agreement at any time by sending
us [an email](mailto:terms@airbnb.com) or by deleting your account. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may
terminate this agreement and your account for any reason by giving you 30
days’ notice via email or using any other contact information you have
provided for your account. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may also terminate this agreement
immediately and without notice and stop providing access to the airbnb
platform if you breach these terms, you violate our policies, you violate
applicable laws, or we reasonably believe termination is necessary to protect
airbnb, its members, or third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if your account has been inactive for
more than two years, we may terminate your account without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.3 member violations**. [CLS] [SEP] if (i) you breach these terms, our
[policies](/help/topic/250/terms---policies), or our [standards](/standards),
(ii) you violate applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights, or (iii)
airbnb believes it is reasonably necessary to protect airbnb, its members, or
third parties; airbnb may, with or without prior notice:

  * suspend or limit your access to or use of the airbnb platform and/or your account;
  * suspend or remove listings, reviews, or other content;
  * cancel pending or confirmed bookings; or
  * suspend or revoke any special status associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]

for minor violations or where otherwise appropriate as airbnb determines in
its sole discretion, you will be given notice of any intended measure by
airbnb and an opportunity to resolve the issue. [CLS] [SEP] you may appeal actions taken
by us under this section by contacting customer service. [CLS] [SEP] if a reservation is
cancelled under this section, the amount paid to the host will be reduced by
the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the guest, and by any other costs
we incur as a result of the cancellation. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.4 legal mandates**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may take any action it determines is
reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of
a court, law enforcement, or other administrative agency or governmental body,
including the measures described above in section 13.3. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.5 effect of termination**. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a host and terminate your airbnb
account, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and your
guests will receive a full refund. [CLS] [SEP] if you terminate your account as a guest,
any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and any refund will
depend upon the terms of the reservation’s cancellation policy. [CLS] [SEP] when this
agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a restoration of your
account or any of your content. [CLS] [SEP] if your access to or use of the airbnb
platform has been limited, or your airbnb account has been suspended, or this
agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new account or
access or use the airbnb platform through an account of another member. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.6 survival**. [CLS] [SEP] parts of these terms that by their nature survive
termination, will survive termination of this agreement, including sections 2
through 26. [CLS] [SEP]

**14\. [CLS] [SEP] modification**. [CLS] [SEP]

airbnb may modify these terms at any time. [CLS] [SEP] when we make material changes to
these terms, we will post the revised terms on the airbnb platform and update
the “last updated” date at the top of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we will also provide you
with notice of any material changes by email at least 30 days before the date
they become effective. [CLS] [SEP] if you disagree with the revised terms, you may
terminate this agreement immediately as provided in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
terminate your agreement before the date the revised terms become effective,
your continued access to or use of the airbnb platform will constitute
acceptance of the revised terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**15\. [CLS] [SEP] resolving complaints and damage claims**. [CLS] [SEP]

if a member provides evidence that another member damaged their real or
personal property (" **damage claim** "), the complaining member can seek
compensation through the [resolution center](/resolutions). [CLS] [SEP] if the complaining
member escalates a damage claim to airbnb, the other member will be given an
opportunity to respond. [CLS] [SEP] if the responding member agrees to pay, or airbnb
determines in its sole discretion that they are responsible for the damage
claim, airbnb via airbnb payments can collect any sums required to cover the
damage claim from the responding member and/or against any security deposit. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that airbnb may seek to recover from you under any insurance
policies you maintain and that airbnb may also pursue against you any remedies
it may have available under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to cooperate in good
faith, provide any information airbnb requests, execute documents, and take
further reasonable action, in connection with damage claims, member
complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other claims related to your
provision or use of host services. [CLS] [SEP]

**16\. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb’s role**. [CLS] [SEP]

we offer a platform that enables members to publish, offer, search for, and
book host services. [CLS] [SEP] while we work hard to ensure our members have great
experiences using airbnb, we do not and cannot control the conduct of guests
and hosts. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that airbnb has the right, but does not have any
obligation, to monitor the use of the airbnb platform and verify information
provided by our members. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may review, disable access to,
remove, or edit content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the airbnb
platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and
customer support purposes); (ii) ensure members’ compliance with these terms;
(iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law
enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address
content that we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set
out in these terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility
criteria, including by removing listings that don’t meet quality and
eligibility criteria. [CLS] [SEP] members acknowledge and agree that airbnb administers
its [policies](/help/topic/250/terms-and-policies) (such as our [extenuating
circumstances policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-
an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance)) and [standards](/trust/standards)
(such as [basic requirements for hosts](/help/article/576/what-are-airbnbs-
basic-requirements-for-hosts)), including decisions about whether and how to
apply them to a particular situation, at its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] members agree to
cooperate with and assist airbnb in good faith, and to provide airbnb with
such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by
airbnb with respect to any investigation undertaken by airbnb regarding the
use or abuse of the airbnb platform. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not acting as an agent for any
member except for where airbnb payments acts as a collection agent as provided
in the payments terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**17\. [CLS] [SEP] member accounts**. [CLS] [SEP]

you must register an account to access and use many features of the airbnb
platform. [CLS] [SEP] registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and
natural persons who are 18 years or older. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you
are not a person or entity barred from using the airbnb platform under the
laws of the united states, your place of residence, or any other applicable
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you must provide accurate, current, and complete information
during registration and keep your account information up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else. [CLS] [SEP] you
are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your
account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. [CLS] [SEP]
you are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your account
and must immediately notify airbnb if you suspect that your credentials have
been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised. [CLS] [SEP] if and as
permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to
provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to
help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party
databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and
(iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex
offender registrations or their local equivalents. [CLS] [SEP]

 **18\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer of warranties**. [CLS] [SEP]

**we provide the airbnb platform and all content “as is” without warranty of
any kind and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied. [CLS] [SEP] for
example: (i) we do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance,
safety, quality, legality or suitability of any guest, host, host service,
listing or third party; (ii) we do not warrant the performance or non-
interruption of the airbnb platform; and (iii) we do not warrant that
verification, identity or background checks conducted on listings or members
(if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct. [CLS] [SEP] any
references to a member or listing being "verified" (or similar language)
indicate only that the member or listing or airbnb has completed a relevant
verification or identification process and nothing else. [CLS] [SEP] the disclaimers in
these terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
statutory rights or warranties we cannot disclaim, the duration of any such
statutorily required rights or warranties, will be limited to the maximum
extent permitted by law.**

**19\. [CLS] [SEP] limitations on liability**. [CLS] [SEP]

**neither airbnb (including its affiliates and personnel) nor any other party
involved in creating, producing, or delivering the airbnb platform or any
content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential
damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service
interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute
products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or
emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these terms, (ii)
the use of or inability to use the airbnb platform or any content, (iii) any
communications, interactions or meetings you may have with someone you
interact or meet with through, or as a result of, your use of the airbnb
platform, or (iv) publishing or booking of a listing, including the provision
or use of host services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not
airbnb has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited
remedy set out in these terms is found to have failed of its essential
purpose.**

**except for our obligation to transmit payments to hosts under these terms,
or make payments under the airbnb host guarantee or japan host insurance, in
no event will airbnb’s aggregate liability for any claim or dispute arising
out of or in connection with these terms, your interaction with any members,
or your use of or inability to use the airbnb platform, any content, or any
host service, exceed: (a) to guests, the amount you paid as a guest during the
12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, (b) to hosts,
the amount paid to you as a host in the 12-month period prior to the event
giving rise to the liability, or (c) to anyone else, one hundred u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars
(us$100).**

**these limitations of liability and damages are fundamental elements of the
agreement between you and airbnb. [CLS] [SEP] if applicable law does not allow the
limitations of liability set out in these terms, the above limitations may not
apply to you.**

**20\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification**. [CLS] [SEP]

**to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release,
defend (at airbnb’s option), indemnify, and hold airbnb (including airbnb
payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any
claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way
connected with: (i) your breach of these terms (including any supplemental or
additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or
our[policies](/help/topic/250/terms---policies) or [standards](/standards),
(ii) your improper use of the airbnb platform, (iii) your interaction with any
member, stay at an accommodation, participation in an experience or other host
service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether
compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind
arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay,
participation or use, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to
accurately report, collect or remit taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws,
regulations or third party rights such as intellectual property or privacy
rights.**

**21\. [CLS] [SEP] contracting entities**. [CLS] [SEP]

based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on
the airbnb platform, schedule 1 below sets out the airbnb entity with whom you
are contracting. [CLS] [SEP] if we identify through the airbnb platform, an airbnb entity
other than the one set out on schedule 1 as being responsible for a product,
feature or transaction, the airbnb entity so identified is your contracting
entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if you change
your country of residence or establishment, the airbnb company you contract
with (as set out on schedule 1) and the applicable version of the terms of
service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment,
from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes. [CLS] [SEP]

**22\. [CLS] [SEP] united states governing law and venue**. [CLS] [SEP]

if you reside or have your place of establishment in the united states, these
terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of
california and the united states of america, without regard to conflict-of-law
provisions. [CLS] [SEP] judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are
excluded from the arbitration agreement in section 23 must be brought in state
or federal court in san francisco, california, unless we both agree to some
other location. [CLS] [SEP] you and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in
san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP]

**23\. [CLS] [SEP] united states dispute resolution and arbitration agreement**. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.1 application**. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement only applies to you if your
country of residence or establishment is the united states. [CLS] [SEP] if your country of
residence or establishment is not the united states, and you nevertheless
attempt to bring any legal claim against airbnb in the united states, this
arbitration agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of
whether this section 23 applies to you, and all other threshold
determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.2 overview of dispute resolution process**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is committed to
participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP] to that end,
these terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this
section 23 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with airbnb’s
customer service team (described in paragraph 23.3, below), and if necessary
(2) a binding arbitration administered by the american arbitration association
(“ **aaa** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small
claims court as an alternative to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.3 mandatory pre-arbitration dispute resolution and notification**. [CLS] [SEP] at
least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and airbnb each agree to
notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to
negotiate an informal resolution. [CLS] [SEP] you must send your notice of dispute to
airbnb by mailing it to airbnb’s agent for service: **csc lawyers
incorporating service, 2710 gateway oaks drive, suite 150n, sacramento,
california 95833**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email
address associated with your airbnb account. [CLS] [SEP] a notice of dispute must include:
the party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the
dispute, and the relief sought. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties are unable to resolve the
dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence
arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration (available at
[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/demand%20for%20arbitration%20consumer%20arbitration%20rules.pdf))
with the aaa and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the aaa
rules (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org)). [CLS] [SEP]

**23.4 agreement to arbitrate**. [CLS] [SEP] **you and airbnb mutually agree that any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these terms or the
applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation
thereof, or any use of the airbnb platform, host services, or any content
(collectively, “** disputes **”) will be settled by binding individual
arbitration (the “** arbitration agreement **”). [CLS] [SEP] if there is a dispute about
whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced or applies to our dispute,
you and airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.**

**23.5 exceptions to arbitration agreement**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb each agree that
the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the
arbitration agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court
of competent jurisdiction (as defined by section 22): (i) any claim or cause
of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or
other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking
emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent
danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request
for the remedy of public injunctive relief. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb agree that the
remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all
arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending
the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the federal
arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.6 arbitration rules and governing law**. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement
evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the federal arbitration act
governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this
provision. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be administered by aaa in accordance with the
consumer arbitration rules and/or other aaa arbitration rules determined to be
applicable by the aaa (the “ **aaa rules** “) then in effect, except as
modified here. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are available at
[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP] in order to initiate arbitration, a
completed written demand (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org))
must be filed with the aaa and provided to the other party, as specified in
the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.7 modification to aaa rules - arbitration hearing/location**. [CLS] [SEP] in order to
make the arbitration most convenient to you, airbnb agrees that any required
arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] county
where you reside; (b) in san francisco county; (c) via phone or video
conference; or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents
to the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.8 modification of aaa rules - attorney’s fees and costs**. [CLS] [SEP] your
arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed
by the aaa rules and, where appropriate, limited by the aaa consumer rules. [CLS] [SEP] if
such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, airbnb will pay
all arbitration fees and expenses. [CLS] [SEP] either party may make a request that the
arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party
has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or
law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise
frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.9 arbitrator’s decision**. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision will include the
essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. [CLS] [SEP]
judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the aaa
rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an
individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
by the claimant’s individual claim. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.10 jury trial waiver**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are
each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.11 no class actions or representative proceedings**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb
acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are
each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney
general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] unless
we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s
claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a final judicial determination that
applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph
as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause
of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or
requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that a claim, cause
of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you
and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are
not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes
of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.12 severability**. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in section 23.11, in the event that
any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable,
such provision will be severed and the remainder of the arbitration agreement
will be given full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.13 changes to agreement to arbitrate**. [CLS] [SEP] if airbnb changes this section 23
after the date you last accepted these terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these terms), you may reject that change by sending us written
notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is
effective. [CLS] [SEP] rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your
prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any dispute between you
and airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which
will remain in effect and enforceable as to any dispute between you and
airbnb. [CLS] [SEP]

**23.14 survival**. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in section 23.12 and subject to section
13.6, this section 23 will survive any termination of these terms and will
continue to apply even if you stop using the airbnb platform or terminate your
airbnb account. [CLS] [SEP]  

**24\. [CLS] [SEP] china governing law and dispute resolution**. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.3 without limitation provisions**. [CLS] [SEP] the above sections 24.1 and 24.2 are
expressed to be without regard to conflict of laws provisions and shall not be

## terms of service for european users

as a consumer you can access the european commission’s online dispute
resolution platform here: <https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr>. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that airbnb is not committed nor obliged to use an alternative dispute
resolution entity to resolve disputes with consumers. [CLS] [SEP]

**section 24 of these terms contains an arbitration agreement and class action
waiver that applies to all claims brought against airbnb in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]
please read them carefully.**

last updated: october 30, 2020

thank you for using airbnb!

these terms of service for european users (“ **terms** ”) are a binding legal
agreement between you and airbnb that govern your use of the websites,
applications, and other offerings from airbnb (collectively, the “ **airbnb
platform** ”). [CLS] [SEP] when used in these terms, “ **airbnb** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us**
,” or “ **our** ” refers to the airbnb entity set out on schedule 1 with whom
you are contracting. [CLS] [SEP]

the airbnb platform offers an online venue that enables users (“ **members**
”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. [CLS] [SEP] members who publish and
offer services are “ **hosts** ” and members who search for, book, or use
services are “ **guests**.” hosts offer accommodations (“ **accommodations**
”), activities, excursions and events (“ **experiences** ”), and a variety of
travel and other services (collectively, “ **host services** ,” and each host
service offering, a “ **listing** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you must register an account to access
and use many features of the airbnb platform, and must keep your account
information accurate. [CLS] [SEP] as the provider of the airbnb platform, airbnb does not
own, control, offer or manage any listings or host services. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not a
party to the contracts concluded directly between hosts and guests, nor is
airbnb a real estate broker, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel
packages under directive (eu) 2015/2302. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not acting as an agent in
any capacity for any member, except as specified in the [payments terms of
service](/terms/payments_terms) (“ **payment terms** ”). [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about
airbnb’s role see section 16. [CLS] [SEP]

we maintain other [terms and policies](/help/topic/250/terms-policies) that
supplement these terms like our [privacy policy](/terms/privacy_policy), which
describes our collection and use of personal data, and our [payments
terms](/terms/payments_terms), which govern any payment services provided to
members by the airbnb payment entities (" **airbnb payments** "). [CLS] [SEP]

if you host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all
laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your
host services. [CLS] [SEP]

schedule 1 - contracting entities

##  **guest terms**

**1\. [CLS] [SEP] our mission**. [CLS] [SEP]

our mission is to create a world where you can belong anywhere. [CLS] [SEP] from cabins to
castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of listings to find the
ones that fit the way you like to travel. [CLS] [SEP] learn more about a listing by
reviewing the description and photos, the host profile, and past guest
reviews. [CLS] [SEP] if you have questions, just message the host. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] searching and booking on airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.1 searching**. [CLS] [SEP] you can search for host services by using criteria like the
type of host service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. [CLS] [SEP]
you can also use filters to refine your search results. [CLS] [SEP] search results are
based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. [CLS] [SEP] relevance
considers factors like price, availability, reviews, customer service and
cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved listings, host
requirements (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] minimum or maximum nights), and more. [CLS] [SEP] learn more about
search results in our [help center](/help/article/39/what-factors-determine-
how-my-listing-appears-in-search-results). [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2 booking**. [CLS] [SEP] when you book a listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges
for your booking including the listing price, applicable fees like [airbnb’s
service fee](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees), [offline
fees](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person), [taxes](/help/article/318/how-do-taxes-work-for-guests) and any other
items identified during checkout (collectively, “ **total price** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you are
also agreeing that airbnb payments may charge and collect any [security
deposit](/help/article/140/how-does-airbnb-handle-security-deposits)
identified during checkout. [CLS] [SEP] when you receive the booking confirmation, a
contract for host services (sometimes called a reservation in these terms) is
formed directly between you and the host. [CLS] [SEP] the cancellation policy and any
other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the listing or
during checkout form part of your contract with the host. [CLS] [SEP] be aware that some
hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their host services. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.3 accommodation reservations**. [CLS] [SEP] an accommodation reservation is a limited
license to enter, occupy and use the accommodation. [CLS] [SEP] the host retains the right
to re-enter the accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is
reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the host, and (iii)
consistent with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you stay past checkout, the host has the
right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including
by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. [CLS] [SEP] you may not exceed the maximum
number of allowed guests. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.4 reservations for experiences and other host services**. [CLS] [SEP] an experience or
other host service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use
that host service. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you
invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for informing the host of any medical or physical conditions, or
other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use
the host service. [CLS] [SEP] except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any
person to join a host service unless they are included as an additional guest
during the booking process. [CLS] [SEP]

**3\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations, travel issues, refunds and booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.1 cancellations, travel issues, and refunds**. [CLS] [SEP] in general, if you cancel a
reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the [cancellation
policy](/home/cancellation_policies) that applies to that reservation. [CLS] [SEP] but, in
certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount
is refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP] if something outside your control requires you to cancel a
reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund under our
[extenuating circumstances policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-
cancel-because-of-an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance). [CLS] [SEP] if the host
cancels, or you experience a travel issue (as defined in our [guest refund
policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy)), you may be entitled to rebooking
assistance or a partial or full refund under our [guest refund
policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy). [CLS] [SEP] different policies apply to certain
categories of listings; for example experiences reservations are governed by
the [experiences guest refund policy](/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-
refund-policy). [CLS] [SEP] see each [policy](/help/topic/250/terms-policies) for details
about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation. [CLS] [SEP] you may
appeal a decision by airbnb by contacting our [customer
service](/help/contact_us). [CLS] [SEP]

**3.2 booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP] hosts and guests are responsible for any
booking modifications they agree to make via the airbnb platform or direct
airbnb customer service to make on their behalf (" **booking modifications**
"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with any
booking modification. [CLS] [SEP]

**4\. [CLS] [SEP] your responsibilities**. [CLS] [SEP]

**you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible
for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to
any accommodation or experience. [CLS] [SEP] for example, this means: (i) you are
responsible for leaving an accommodation (and related personal property) in
the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with
integrity, treat others with respect and comply with applicable laws at all
times. [CLS] [SEP] if you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you
bring a minor to a host service, you must be legally authorized to act on
behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that
minor.**

##  **host terms**

**5\. [CLS] [SEP] hosting on airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.1 host**. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your
accommodation, experience, or other host service with our vibrant community of
guests - and earn money doing it. [CLS] [SEP] it’s easy to create a listing and you are in
control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each
listing. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.2 contracting with guests**. [CLS] [SEP] when you accept a booking request, or receive
a booking confirmation through the airbnb platform, you are entering into a
contract directly with the guest, and are responsible for delivering the host
service under the terms and at the price specified in your listing. [CLS] [SEP] you are
also agreeing to pay applicable fees like [airbnb’s service
fee](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees) (and applicable
[taxes](/help/article/481/how-do-taxes-work-for-hosts)) for each booking. [CLS] [SEP]
airbnb payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you
agree to a different method. [CLS] [SEP] any terms or conditions that you include in any
supplement contract with guests must: (i) be consistent with these terms, our
[policies](/help/topic/250/terms-policies), and the information provided in
your listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your listing description. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.3 independence of hosts**. [CLS] [SEP] your relationship with airbnb is that of an
independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or
partner of airbnb, except that airbnb payments acts as a payment collection
agent as described in the payments terms. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb does not direct or control
your host service and you understand that you have complete discretion whether
and when to provide host services and at what price and on what terms to offer
them. [CLS] [SEP]

**6\. [CLS] [SEP] managing your listing**. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.1 creating and managing your listing**. [CLS] [SEP] the airbnb platform provides tools
that make it easy for you to set up and manage a listing. [CLS] [SEP] your listing must
include complete and accurate information about your host service, your price,
other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, [offline
fees](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person), and any rules or requirements that apply to your guests or listing. [CLS] [SEP]
you are responsible for your acts and omissions as well as for keeping your
listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like
photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you obtain
appropriate insurance for your host services and suggest you carefully review
policy terms and conditions like coverage details and exclusions. [CLS] [SEP] you may only
maintain one listing per accommodation, but may have multiple listings for a
single property if it has multiple places to stay. [CLS] [SEP] any offer of an experience
is subject to our [additional terms for experience hosts](/experiences/terms-
of-service). [CLS] [SEP]

**6.2 know your legal obligations**. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for understanding and
complying with any laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties
that apply to your listing or host services. [CLS] [SEP] for example: some landlords and
leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit
subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. [CLS] [SEP] some cities have
zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential
properties. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions require hosts to register, get a permit, or
obtain a license before providing certain host services (such as short-term
rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding
tours or operating a vehicle). [CLS] [SEP] in some places, the host services you want to
offer may be prohibited altogether. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions require that you
register guests who stay at your accommodation. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions have laws
that create tenancy rights for guests and additional obligations for hosts. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws
that may apply to longer stays. [CLS] [SEP] check your local rules to learn what rules
apply to the host services you plan to offer. [CLS] [SEP] information we provide regarding
legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should
independently confirm your obligations. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for handling and
using personal data of guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy
laws and these terms, including our [host privacy
standards](/terms/host_privacy_standards). [CLS] [SEP] if you have questions about how
local laws apply you should always seek legal advice. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.3 search ranking**. [CLS] [SEP] the ranking of listings in search results on the
airbnb platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main
parameters:

  * guest search parameters (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] number of guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),
  * listing characteristics (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, reviews, type of host service, host status, age of the listing, average guest popularity),
  * guest booking experience (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] customer service and cancellation history of the host, ease of booking), 
  * host requirements (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and
  * guest preferences (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] previous trips, saved listings, location from where the guest is searching). [CLS] [SEP]

search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear
on our website. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may allow hosts to promote their listings in search or
elsewhere on the airbnb platform by paying an additional fee. [CLS] [SEP] more information
about the factors that determine how your listing appears in search results,
our current promotional programs (if any) and how we identify promoted content
can be found in our [help center](/help/article/39/what-factors-determine-how-
my-listing-appears-in-search-results). [CLS] [SEP]

**6.4 your responsibilities**. [CLS] [SEP] **you are responsible for your own acts and
omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you
allow to participate in providing your host services. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for
setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your listing. [CLS] [SEP]
you must describe any and all fees and charges in your listing description and
may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the airbnb platform
except those expressly authorized by our[offline fee
policy](/help/article/2827/what-is-the-airbnb-policy-for-collecting-fees-in-
person). [CLS] [SEP] do not encourage guests to create third-party accounts, submit
reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the
airbnb platform in violation of our [off-platform
policy](/help/article/2799/airbnbs-offplatform-policy). [CLS] [SEP] **

**6.5 hosting as a team or organization**. [CLS] [SEP] if you work with a co-host or host
as part of a team, business or other organization, the entity and each
individual who participates in providing host services, is responsible and
liable as a host under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you accept terms or enter into
contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into
contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that
each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it
is established. [CLS] [SEP] if you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that
you are authorized to perform those functions. [CLS] [SEP] if you instruct airbnb to
transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other hosts, or send
payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible
and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you
provide. [CLS] [SEP]

**7\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations, travel issues, and booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP]

**7.1 cancellations and travel issues**. [CLS] [SEP] in general, if a guest cancels a
reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy
that applies to that reservation. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, you should not cancel on a guest
without a valid reason under our [extenuating circumstances
policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-an-emergency-
or-unavoidable-circumstance) or applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel on a guest
without such a valid reason, we may impose a [cancellation fee and other
consequences](/help/article/990/as-a-host-what-penalties-apply-if-i-cancel-a-
reservation-for-a-stay). [CLS] [SEP] if: (i) a guest experiences a travel issue (as
defined by the [guest refund policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy)), (ii) an
[extenuating circumstance](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-
because-of-an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance) arises, or (iii) a
reservation is cancelled under section 13 of these terms, the amount you are
paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the
guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the
cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] if a guest receives a refund after you have already been paid,
or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by airbnb exceeds your
payout, airbnb (via airbnb payments) may recover that amount from you,
including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
airbnb’s [guest refund policy](/terms/guest_refund_policy), [extenuating
circumstances policy](/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-
an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance), and these terms preempt the
cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the
cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to guests. [CLS] [SEP] if we
reasonably expect to provide a refund to a guest under one of these policies,
we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund
decision is made. [CLS] [SEP] if you host an experience please note that the [experience
cancellation policy](/experiences/cancellation-policy), [experiences guest
refund policy](/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-refund-policy) and
different [cancellation fees and consequences](/help/article/2039/as-an-
experience-host-what-happens-if-i-need-to-cancel-an-instance-of-an-experience)
apply to your reservations. [CLS] [SEP] see each [policy](/help/topic/250/terms---
policies) for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in
each situation. [CLS] [SEP] you may appeal a decision by airbnb by contacting our
[customer service](/help/contact_us). [CLS] [SEP]

**7.2 booking modifications**. [CLS] [SEP] hosts and guests are responsible for any
booking modifications they agree to make via the airbnb platform or direct
airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any
additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a booking modification. [CLS] [SEP]

**8\. [CLS] [SEP] taxes**. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.1 host taxes**. [CLS] [SEP] as a host, you are responsible for determining and
fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit or
include in your price any applicable vat or other indirect taxes, occupancy
taxes, tourist, income or other taxes (" **taxes** "). [CLS] [SEP]

**8.2 collection and remittance by airbnb**. [CLS] [SEP] in jurisdictions where airbnb
facilitates the collection and/or remittance of taxes on behalf of hosts, you
instruct and authorize airbnb to collect taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit
such taxes to the relevant tax authority. [CLS] [SEP] any taxes that are collected and/or
remitted by airbnb are identified to members on their transaction records, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may seek additional amounts from members (including by
deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the taxes
collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that members’
tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for taxes collected by
airbnb is a refund from the applicable tax authority. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and
agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected members, to
cease the collection and remittance of taxes in any jurisdiction for any
reason. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.3 tax information**. [CLS] [SEP] in certain jurisdictions, tax regulations may require
that we collect and/or report tax information about you, or withhold taxes
from payouts to you, or both. [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to provide us with documentation
that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold
taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as
required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for vat,
gst, consumption or other taxes for your host services to facilitate accurate
tax reporting by our guests and their organizations. [CLS] [SEP]

## general terms

**9\. [CLS] [SEP] reviews**. [CLS] [SEP]

after each host service, guests and hosts will have an opportunity to review
each other. [CLS] [SEP] your review must be accurate and may not contain any
discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our
[content policy](/help/article/546/what-is-airbnb-s-content-policy) or [review
policy](/help/article/2673/airbnbs-review-policy). [CLS] [SEP] reviews are not verified by
airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading. [CLS] [SEP]

**10\. [CLS] [SEP] content**. [CLS] [SEP]

parts of the airbnb platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos,

content includes personal information, such content will only be used for
these purposes if such use complies with applicable data protection laws in
accordance with our [privacy policy](/terms/privacy_policy). [CLS] [SEP] where airbnb pays
for the creation of content or facilitates its creation, airbnb may own that
content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that. [CLS] [SEP] you
are solely responsible for all content that you provide and warrant that you
either own it or are authorized to grant airbnb the rights described in these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible and liable if any of your content violates or
infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party. [CLS] [SEP]
content must comply with our [content policy](/help/article/546/what-is-
airbnb-s-content-policy) and [nondiscrimination
policy](/terms/nondiscrimination_policy), which prohibit, among other things,
discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent and illegal content. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that airbnb may make available services or automated tools to
translate content and that your content may be translated using such services
or tools. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations
and members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations. [CLS] [SEP]

**11\. [CLS] [SEP] fees**. [CLS] [SEP]

airbnb may charge fees (and applicable taxes) to hosts and guests for use of
the airbnb platform. [CLS] [SEP] more information about when service fees apply and how
they are calculated can be found on our [service fees
page](/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees). [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise
provided on the airbnb platform, service fees are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb
reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide
members notice of any fee changes before they become effective. [CLS] [SEP] fee changes
will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change. [CLS] [SEP]
if you disagree with a fee change you may terminate this agreement at any time
pursuant to section 13.2. [CLS] [SEP]

content poses an imminent risk of harm to a person or property, you should
immediately contact local authorities before contacting airbnb. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
if you believe that a member, listing or content has violated our
[standards](/standards), you should report your concerns to airbnb. [CLS] [SEP] if you

response to any report. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.1 term**. [CLS] [SEP] the agreement between you and airbnb reflected by these terms
remains in effect until either you or we terminate the agreement in accordance
with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.2 termination**. [CLS] [SEP] you may terminate this agreement at any time by sending
us an email or by deleting your account. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may terminate this agreement
for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice via email or using any other
contact information you have provided for your account. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may also
terminate this agreement immediately and without prior notice and stop
providing access to the airbnb platform if (i) you materially breach these
terms or our [policies](/help/topic/250/terms---policies), (ii) you violate
applicable laws, or (iii) such action is necessary to protect the personal
safety or property of airbnb, its members, or third parties (for example in
the case of fraudulent behavior of a member), or (iv) your account has been
inactive for more than two years. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.3 member violations**. [CLS] [SEP] if (i) you breach these terms, our
[policies](/help/topic/250/terms---policies), or our [standards](/standards),
(ii) you violate applicable laws, regulations or third party rights, (iii) you
have repeatedly received poor reviews or airbnb otherwise becomes aware of or
has received complaints about your performance or conduct, (vi) you have
repeatedly cancelled confirmed bookings or failed to respond to booking

  * suspend or limit your access to or use of the airbnb platform and/or your account;
  * suspend or remove listings, reviews, or other content;
  * cancel pending or confirmed bookings; or
  * suspend or revoke any special status associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]

in case of non-material violations or where otherwise appropriate, you will be
given notice of any intended measure by airbnb and an opportunity to resolve
the issue, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection
or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate
interests of other members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable
laws. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.4 legal mandates**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may take any action it determines is
reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of
a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body,
including the measures described above in section 13.3. [CLS] [SEP]

**13.5 effect of termination**. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a host and terminate your airbnb
account, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and your
guests will receive a full refund. [CLS] [SEP] if you terminate your account as a guest,

notice of the proposed changes by email at least thirty (30) days before the
date they become effective. [CLS] [SEP] if you disagree with the revised terms, you may
terminate this agreement immediately as provided in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we will
inform you about your right to terminate the agreement in the notification
email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not terminate your agreement before the date the revised
terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the airbnb platform
will constitute acceptance of the revised terms. [CLS] [SEP]

 **15\. [CLS] [SEP] resolving complaints and damage claims**. [CLS] [SEP]

if a member provides evidence that another member has culpably damaged their
real or personal property (" **damage claim** "), the complaining member can
seek compensation through the [resolution center](/resolutions). [CLS] [SEP] if the
complaining member escalates a damage claim to airbnb, the other member will
be given an opportunity to respond. [CLS] [SEP] if the responding member agrees to pay, or
airbnb determines under consideration of any applicable statutory rules on the
burden of proof that they are responsible for the damage claim, airbnb via
airbnb payments can collect any sums required to cover the damage claim from
the responding member and/or against any security deposit. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may also
pursue against you any remedies it may have available under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information airbnb requests,
execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in connection with
damage claims, member complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other
claims related to your provision or use of host services. [CLS] [SEP] you may appeal a
decision by airbnb by contacting our [customer service](/help/contact_us). [CLS] [SEP] any
decisions made by airbnb in relation to a damage claim do not affect your
contractual and statutory rights. [CLS] [SEP] your right to take legal action before a
court of law remains unaffected. [CLS] [SEP]

**16\. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb’s role**. [CLS] [SEP]

we offer a platform that enables members to publish, offer, search for, and
book host services. [CLS] [SEP] when members make or accept a booking, they are entering
into a contract directly with each other. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is not and does not become a
party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between members. [CLS] [SEP]
airbnb is not acting as an agent for any member except for where airbnb
payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the payments terms. [CLS] [SEP] while
we work hard to ensure our members have great experiences using airbnb, we do
not and cannot control the conduct or performance of guests and hosts and do
not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of
any listings or host services or (ii) the truth or accuracy of any listing
descriptions, reviews, or other content provided by members. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge
that airbnb has no general obligation to monitor the use of the airbnb
platform and verify information provided by our members, but has the right to
review, disable access to, remove, or edit content to: (i) operate, secure and
improve the airbnb platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment,
investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure members’ compliance
with these terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement
of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental
body; (iv) address member content that we determine is harmful or
objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these terms; and (vi) maintain and
enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing listings
that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria. [CLS] [SEP] where we remove or disable
content, we will notify a member and provide the reasons for such a measure,
unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or
prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate
interests of other members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable
laws. [CLS] [SEP] you may appeal such a decision by contacting our [customer
service](/help/contact_us). [CLS] [SEP] members agree to cooperate with and assist airbnb
in good faith, and to provide airbnb with such information and take such
actions as may be reasonably requested by airbnb with respect to any
investigation undertaken by airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the airbnb
platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**17\. [CLS] [SEP] member accounts**. [CLS] [SEP]

you must register an account to access and use many features of the airbnb
platform. [CLS] [SEP] registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and
natural persons who are 18 years or older. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you
are not a person or entity barred from using the airbnb platform under the
laws of the united states, your place of residence, or any other applicable
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you must provide accurate, current, and complete information
during registration and keep your account information up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else. [CLS] [SEP] you
are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your
account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. [CLS] [SEP]
you must immediately notify airbnb if you suspect that your credentials have
been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible and liable for activities conducted through your airbnb account,
unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise
negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your
credentials). [CLS] [SEP] if and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no
obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii)
undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii)
screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports
from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of
criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents. [CLS] [SEP]

**18\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer**. [CLS] [SEP]

**we do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance, safety,
quality, legality or suitability of any guest, host, host service, listing or
third party and we do not warrant that verification, identity or background
checks conducted on members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent
future misconduct. [CLS] [SEP] any references to a member being "verified" (or similar
language) indicate only that the member or airbnb has completed a relevant
verification or identification process and nothing else. [CLS] [SEP] we are not
responsible for outages or disruptions of the internet and telecommunications
infrastructure which are beyond our control and can lead to interruptions in
the availability of the airbnb platform. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb may, temporarily and under
consideration of the members’ legitimate interests (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] by providing prior
notice), restrict the availability of the airbnb platform or certain features
thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or
integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the
proper or improved functioning of the airbnb platform.**

**19\. [CLS] [SEP] liability**. [CLS] [SEP]

airbnb is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by
us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. [CLS] [SEP] the same
applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in
case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. [CLS] [SEP] for any negligent breaches
of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives,
directors, or other vicarious agents airbnb’s liability is limited to the
typically occurring foreseeable damages. [CLS] [SEP] essential contractual obligations are
such duties of airbnb in whose proper fulfillment you regularly trust and must
trust for the proper execution of the contract. [CLS] [SEP] any additional liability of
airbnb is excluded. [CLS] [SEP]

**20\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification**. [CLS] [SEP]

**to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release,
defend (at airbnb’s option), indemnify, and hold airbnb (including airbnb
payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any
claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way
connected with: (i) your breach of these terms (including any supplemental or
additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or
our[policies](/help/topic/250/terms---policies) or [standards](/standards),
(ii) your improper use of the airbnb platform, (iii) your interaction with any
member, stay at an accommodation, participation in an experience or other host
service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether
compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind
arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay,
participation or use, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to
accurately report, collect or remit taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws,
regulations or third party rights such as intellectual property or privacy
rights. [CLS] [SEP] the indemnification obligation only applies if and to the extent that
the claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses have been adequately
caused by your culpable breach of a contractual obligation.**

 **21\. [CLS] [SEP] contracting entities**. [CLS] [SEP]

based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on
the airbnb platform, schedule 1 below sets out the airbnb entity with whom you
are contracting. [CLS] [SEP] if we identify through the airbnb platform, an airbnb entity
other than the one set out on schedule 1 as being responsible for a product,
feature or transaction, the airbnb entity so identified is your contracting
entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if you change
your country of residence or establishment to a country outside of the eea,
switzerland or the united kingdom, the airbnb company you contract with and
the applicable version of the terms of service will be determined by your new
country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of
residence or establishment changes. [CLS] [SEP]

**22\. [CLS] [SEP] applicable law and jurisdiction**. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms are governed by and construed in accordance with irish law. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are acting as a consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection
regulations in your country of residence contain provisions that are more
beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of
irish law. [CLS] [SEP] as a consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to
these terms before the competent court of your place of residence or the
competent court of airbnb's place of business in ireland. [CLS] [SEP] if airbnb wishes to
enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the
courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. [CLS] [SEP] if you are acting as a
business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the irish
courts. [CLS] [SEP]

**23\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous**. [CLS] [SEP]

additional terms, conditions, policies, guidelines, standards, and in-product
disclosures, these terms constitute the entire agreement between airbnb and
you pertaining to your access to or use of the airbnb platform and supersede

**24\. [CLS] [SEP] united states dispute resolution and arbitration agreement**. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.1 application**. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement only applies to you if your
country of residence or establishment is the united states. [CLS] [SEP] if your country of
residence or establishment is not the united states, and you nevertheless
attempt to bring any legal claim against airbnb in the united states, this
arbitration agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of
whether this section 24 applies to you, and all other threshold
determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.2 overview of dispute resolution process**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb is committed to
participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP] to that end,
these terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this
section 24 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with airbnb’s
customer service team (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary
(2) a binding arbitration administered by the american arbitration association
(“ **aaa** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small
claims court as an alternative to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.3 mandatory pre-arbitration dispute resolution and notification**. [CLS] [SEP] at
least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and airbnb each agree to
notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to
negotiate an informal resolution. [CLS] [SEP] you must send your notice of dispute to
airbnb by mailing it to airbnb’s agent for service: **csc lawyers
incorporating service, 2710 gateway oaks drive, suite 150n, sacramento,
california 95833**. [CLS] [SEP] airbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email
address associated with your airbnb account. [CLS] [SEP] a notice of dispute must include:
the party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the
dispute, and the relief sought. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties are unable to resolve the
dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence
arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration (available at
[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/demand%20for%20arbitration%20consumer%20arbitration%20rules.pdf))
with the aaa and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the aaa
rules (available at
[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/demand%20for%20arbitration%20consumer%20arbitration%20rules.pdf)). [CLS] [SEP]

**24.4 agreement to arbitrate**. [CLS] [SEP]  **you and airbnb mutually agree that any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these terms or the
applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation
thereof, or any use of the airbnb platform, host services, or any content
(collectively, “** disputes **”) will be settled by binding individual
arbitration (the “** arbitration agreement **”). [CLS] [SEP] if there is a dispute about
whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced or applies to our dispute,
you and airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.** ****

**24.5 exceptions to arbitration agreement**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb each agree that
the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the
arbitration agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court
of competent jurisdiction (as defined by section 22 of the terms of service
for non-european users): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or
threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief
based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a
crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public
injunctive relief. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive
relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies,
or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration
pursuant to section 3 of the federal arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.6 arbitration rules and governing law**. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement
evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the federal arbitration act
governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this
provision. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be administered by aaa in accordance with the
consumer arbitration rules and/or other aaa arbitration rules determined to be
applicable by the aaa (the “ **aaa rules** “) then in effect, except as
modified here. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are available at
[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP] in order to initiate arbitration, a
completed written demand (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org))
must be filed with the aaa and provided to the other party, as specified in
the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.7 modification to aaa rules - arbitration hearing/location**. [CLS] [SEP] in order to
make the arbitration most convenient to you, airbnb agrees that any required
arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] county
where you reside; (b) in san francisco county; (c) via phone or video
conference; or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents
to the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.8 modification of aaa rules - attorney’s fees and costs**. [CLS] [SEP] your
arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed
by the aaa rules and, where appropriate, limited by the aaa consumer rules. [CLS] [SEP] if
such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, airbnb will pay
all arbitration fees and expenses. [CLS] [SEP] either party may make a request that the
arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party
has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or
law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise
frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.9 arbitrator’s decision**. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision will include the
essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. [CLS] [SEP]
judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the aaa
rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an
individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
by the claimant’s individual claim. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.10 jury trial waiver**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are
each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.11 no class actions or representative proceedings**. [CLS] [SEP] you and airbnb
acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are
each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney
general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] unless
we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s
claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a final judicial determination that
applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph
as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause
of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or
requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that a claim, cause
of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you
and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are
not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes
of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.12 severability**. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in section 24.11, in the event that
any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable,
such provision will be severed and the remainder of the arbitration agreement
will be given full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.13 changes to agreement to arbitrate**. [CLS] [SEP] if airbnb changes this section 24
after the date you last accepted these terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these terms), you may reject that change by sending us written
notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is
effective. [CLS] [SEP] rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your
prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any dispute between you
and airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which
will remain in effect and enforceable as to any dispute between you and
airbnb. [CLS] [SEP]

**24.14 survival**. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in section 24.12, and subject to
section 13.6 of the terms of service for non-european users this section 24
will survive any termination of these terms and will continue to apply even if
you stop using the airbnb platform or terminate your airbnb account. [CLS] [SEP]
