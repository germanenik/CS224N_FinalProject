# surfshark terms of service

since nobody enjoys reading these things, we’re including short blurbs of text
to help you understand what each section is about. [CLS] [SEP] you should still read the
whole thing since this is only a comment and the terms are the binding
document you’re agreeing to if you have a surfshark account. [CLS] [SEP] but we’re not
judging. [CLS] [SEP]

the terms of service, do not access or use the website or our services. [CLS] [SEP] by
accessing or using the website and our services, you agree to be bound by the
terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]

we may change these terms of service from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] we will post a notice

below:

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] what services does surfshark provide?

a vpn, plus a bunch of other services that all have to do with privacy and
security. [CLS] [SEP]

surfshark provides virtual private network (vpn) services, also other privacy
and cyber security related services (“services”). [CLS] [SEP] services include, but are
not limited to vpn and other software, extensions, applications, information
and content made available to you by surfshark. [CLS] [SEP] a vpn is a secure way to
protect your online activities by encrypting your data connection. [CLS] [SEP] thus, third
parties are unable to monitor your network traffic, such as websites,
downloaded files, or other used internet services. [CLS] [SEP] with surfshark you can
connect to different vpn servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your
location. [CLS] [SEP]

we don’t collect logs or any other information that’d let us identify you. [CLS] [SEP] the
only things we do collect are strictly necessary to provide you with our
services. [CLS] [SEP] you can find more details about that in the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

**no-logs policy** is one of the most important features of our services. [CLS] [SEP] it
means your activities are not in any way logged, retained, or transferred to
third parties when you connect to our services. [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect ip
addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection
time stamps, network traffic and other similar data. [CLS] [SEP] we can ensure such policy
as we are based in the british virgin islands, which does not require data
storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our services are
automated. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by
you is processed in order to provide services to you. [CLS] [SEP] more information on what
information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our
privacy policy at [**https://surfshark.com/privacy-
policy**](https://surfshark.com/privacy-policy). [CLS] [SEP] our privacy policy is
incorporated herein by reference. [CLS] [SEP]

no shady stuff, please. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities
committed by using surfshark services. [CLS] [SEP] as we are not logging any information
about your activities, you are using the surfshark services at your own
responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] surfshark will not be liable in any way or form for illegal
actions done by you arising through or from the use of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] do i have to create an account?

yup. [CLS] [SEP] and you’re responsible for it. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to use some of the surfshark services, you will be asked to set up an
account. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account
including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your
account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on
which your account resides or is accessible. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] what happens if i share or lose my account information?

please take care of your information. [CLS] [SEP] if you tell us about losing it right
away, we may be able to help you out. [CLS] [SEP]

if you open an account to use or access the services, you must complete the
registration process by providing the complete and accurate information
requested on the registration form. [CLS] [SEP] you may be asked to provide an e-mail
address and password. [CLS] [SEP] **you are entirely responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your password.** you may not sell, or trade that account to
any other person. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account,
e-mail address, or password. [CLS] [SEP] we are not liable for any loss that you or any
third party incur as a result of someone else using your password, either with
or without your knowledge. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to terminate your account at
any time. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] what is surfshark payment and refund policy?

we can refund you on the basis of our 30-day money-back guarantee. [CLS] [SEP] except if
you signed up via itunes/app store/amazon or with a prepaid card/gift card. [CLS] [SEP]
these are out of our hands. [CLS] [SEP]

you can subscribe to surfshark services on a service period basis. [CLS] [SEP] after
signing up for surfshark services you may choose a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] only some
of our services are free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

paid surfshark services renew automatically at the end of each service period
and your chosen payment method is charged again, unless you decide to cancel
your automatic payments before the automatic renewal. [CLS] [SEP] surfshark may change the
price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other
subscription terms from time to time and will communicate any price or other
changes to you in advance. [CLS] [SEP] subject to applicable law, you accept the new price
and terms by continuing to use the services after the changes take effect. [CLS] [SEP]

your satisfaction with our services is our main goal. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose not to use
our paid services anymore, we guarantee you a right to claim a refund within
30 days following your purchase of our services. [CLS] [SEP] however, we would like to
solve your issue before you decide to cancel the subscription, therefore you
are always welcome to reach out to us at [**[email protected]**](/cdn-
cgi/l/email-protection#added8ddddc2dfd9edded8dfcbdec5ccdfc683cec2c0). [CLS] [SEP] you can
get a refund for the cancelation of our services twice. [CLS] [SEP] if you already have
been granted a refund once, you can get the second refund if the period
between both cancellations for which you claim refund is not less than 6
months. [CLS] [SEP] if you purchase our services again after the second refund, you will
not be granted a refund for any further cancellation. [CLS] [SEP]

as a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days
from the purchase has passed. [CLS] [SEP] nevertheless, in the exceptional cases, we will
consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can
demonstrate that the services which you purchased were not available or usable
and that you made reasonable attempts to contact us regarding this issue. [CLS] [SEP] in
such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of services’ fees paid
during the subscription period when the services were not available or usable. [CLS] [SEP]

if you purchase our subscription through itunes/app store/amazon – we are not
able to grant you a refund, as subscriptions purchased via the itunes/app
store/amazon are subject to itunes/app store/amazon refund policies. [CLS] [SEP] in such a
case, you would have to contact a specific store for a refund. [CLS] [SEP] surfshark
cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, refunds are
handled according to the terms and conditions of the reseller from which the
product was purchased. [CLS] [SEP]

payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded. [CLS] [SEP] for payments
made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in us dollars is refunded in the
same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund). [CLS] [SEP]

you have a right to cancel your account at any time, however, canceled
accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service
period. [CLS] [SEP] no refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of
these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

any fees charged by surfshark are exclusive of taxes. [CLS] [SEP] nethertheless, we may
calculate and add taxes or duties, including, but not limited to vat, gst and
other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you at the time of purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

commitment, we have implemented an automated infrastructure maintenance system
which continuously manages our network capacity. [CLS] [SEP]
