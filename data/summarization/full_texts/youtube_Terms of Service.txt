[youtube community
guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. [CLS] [SEP] for

below. [CLS] [SEP]

**license to youtube**

by providing content to the service, you grant to youtube a worldwide, non-
exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that

and perform it) in connection with the service and youtube’s (and its
successors' and affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting
and redistributing part or all of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

you also grant each other user of the service a worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to access your content through the service, and to use
that content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works,
display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the service (such as
video playback or embeds). [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, this license does not grant any rights
or permissions for a user to make use of your content independent of the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

**duration of license**

the licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of
time after you remove or delete your content from the service. [CLS] [SEP] you understand

starting november 18, 2020, any payments you may be entitled to receive from

from the service at any time. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the option to [make a copy of your
content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. [CLS] [SEP]
you must remove your content if you no longer have the rights required by
these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**removal of content by youtube**

if we reasonably believe that any content is in breach of this agreement or
may cause harm to youtube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take
down that content in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you with the reason for
our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the
law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk
legal liability for youtube or our affiliates; (b) would compromise an
investigation or the integrity or operation of the service; or (c) would cause
harm to any user, other third party, youtube or our affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn
more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the
[troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of
our help center. [CLS] [SEP]

**copyright protection**

we provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
property online in our [youtube copyright
center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). [CLS] [SEP] if you believe your
copyright has been infringed on the service, please [send us a
notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622). [CLS] [SEP]

process in our [youtube copyright
center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find
information about how to resolve a copyright strike. [CLS] [SEP] youtube's policies
provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat
infringers’ access to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

# **account suspension & termination**

**terminations by you**  
you may stop using the service at any time. [CLS] [SEP] follow these
[instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account) to
delete the service from your google account, which involves closing your
youtube channel and removing your data. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the option to download a
copy of your data first. [CLS] [SEP]

**terminations and suspensions by youtube for cause**

youtube may suspend or terminate your access, your google account, or your
google account’s access to all or part of the service if (a) you materially or
repeatedly breach this agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with
a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct
that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third
party, youtube or our affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]  

**terminations by youtube for service changes**

youtube may terminate your access, or your google account’s access to all or
part of the service if youtube believes, in its sole discretion, that
provision of the service to you is no longer commercially viable. [CLS] [SEP]

**notice for termination or suspension**

we will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by youtube
unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the
direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal
liability for youtube or our affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation
or the integrity or operation of the service; or (c) would cause harm to any
user, other third party, youtube or our affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] where youtube is
terminating your access for service changes, where reasonably possible, you
will be provided with sufficient time to export your content from the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**effect of account suspension or termination**

if your google account is terminated or your google account’s access to the
service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the service
(such as viewing only) without an account, and this agreement will continue to
apply to such use. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe your google account has been terminated in
error, you can [appeal using this
form](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube). [CLS] [SEP]

# **about software in the service**

**downloadable software  
** when the service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the
youtube studio application), you give permission for that software to update
automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available,
subject to your device settings. [CLS] [SEP] unless that software is governed by
additional terms which provide a license, youtube gives you a personal,
worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the
software provided to you by youtube as part of the service. [CLS] [SEP] this license is
for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the
service as provided by youtube, in the manner permitted by this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you
are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the
software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that
software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have youtube’s
written permission. [CLS] [SEP]

**open source  
** some software used in our service may be offered under an open source
license that we make available to you. [CLS] [SEP] there may be provisions in an open
source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure
to read those licenses. [CLS] [SEP]

# **other legal terms**

**warranty disclaimer**  
other than as expressly stated in this agreement or as required by law, the
service is provided “as is” and youtube does not make any specific commitments
or warranties about the service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we don’t make any warranties
about: (a) the content provided through the service; (b) the specific features
of the service, or its accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability to meet
your needs; or (c) that any content you submit will be accessible on the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

**limitation of liability**

except as required by applicable law, youtube, its affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents will not be responsible for any loss of
profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings;
loss or corruption of data; indirect or consequential loss; punitive damages
caused by:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies on the service;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] personal injury or property damage resulting from your use of the service;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] any unauthorized access to or use of the service;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] any interruption or cessation of the service;

  6. [CLS] [SEP] any content whether submitted by a user or youtube, including your use of content; and/or
  7. [CLS] [SEP] the removal or unavailability of any content. [CLS] [SEP]

this provision applies to any claim, regardless of whether the claim asserted
is based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory. [CLS] [SEP]

youtube and its affiliates’ total liability for any claims arising from or
relating to the service is limited to the greater of: (a) the amount of
revenue that youtube has paid to you from your use of the service in the 12
months before the date of your notice, in writing to youtube, of the claim;
and (b) usd $500. [CLS] [SEP]

**indemnity**

to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless youtube, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to
attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the service; (ii)
your violation of any term of this agreement; (iii) your violation of any
third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or
privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your content caused damage to a third
party. [CLS] [SEP] this defense and indemnification obligation will survive this agreement
and your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**third-party links  
** the service may contain links to third-party websites and online services
that are not owned or controlled by youtube. [CLS] [SEP] youtube has no control over, and
assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. [CLS] [SEP] be aware
when you leave the service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy
of each third-party website and online service that you visit. [CLS] [SEP]

# **about this agreement**

**modifying this agreement**  
we may modify this agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our service
or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. [CLS] [SEP] youtube will provide reasonable
advance notice of any material modifications to this agreement and the
opportunity to review them, except that modifications addressing newly
available features of the service or modifications made for legal reasons may
be effective immediately without notice. [CLS] [SEP] modifications to this agreement will
only apply going forward. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the modified terms, you
should remove any content you have uploaded and discontinue your use of the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

continue to apply to you: “other legal terms”, “about this agreement”, and the
licenses granted by you will continue as described under “duration of

if it turns out that a particular term of this agreement is not enforceable
for any reason, this will not affect any other terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**no** **waiver  
** if you fail to comply with this agreement and we do not take immediate
action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have
(such as the right to take action in the future). [CLS] [SEP]

**interpretation**

in these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,”
and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**governing law  
** all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the service will be
governed by california law, except california’s conflict of laws rules, and
will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of santa clara
county, california, usa. [CLS] [SEP] you and youtube consent to personal jurisdiction in
those courts. [CLS] [SEP]

**limitation on legal action**

you and youtube agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to
the services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action
accrues. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]
