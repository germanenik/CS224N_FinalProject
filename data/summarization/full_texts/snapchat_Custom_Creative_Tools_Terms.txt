# snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] custom creative tools terms

(if you are located in the united states)

effective: may 10, 2018

arbitration notice: these terms contain an [arbitration](/en-us/terms/custom-
creative-tools#arbitration) provision a little later on. [CLS] [SEP] except for certain
types of disputes mentioned in the [arbitration](/en-us/terms/#arbitration)
provision of the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us), you and
snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] agree that disputes between us will be resolved by mandatory binding
arbitration, and you and snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] waive any right to participate in a class-
action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

## introduction

please read these snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] custom creative tools terms (“terms”) carefully. [CLS] [SEP]
these terms form a legally binding contract between you (or your organization)
and snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“snap”), and govern your order for snap to run a lens or filter
(each, a “creative tool”). [CLS] [SEP] the products and services described in these terms
are “services” as defined in the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service](/en-
us/terms/#terms-us). [CLS] [SEP] if you are located in the united states when you submit
an order for snap to run a creative tool, or if you are using the services on
behalf of a business with its principal place of business located in the
united states, these terms govern your order. [CLS] [SEP] if you are located outside the
united states when you submit an order for snap to run a creative tool or are
using the services on behalf of a business with its principal place of
business located outside the united states, the [snap group limited custom
creative tools terms](/en-us/terms/custom-creative-tools/#terms-row) apply. [CLS] [SEP]

please print a copy of these terms and keep them for your reference. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms incorporate by reference the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service](/en-
us/terms/#terms-us), [community guidelines](/en-us/community-guidelines),
[snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-guidelines/), [snapcode usage
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-us/article/snapcode-guidelines),
[advertising policies](/en-us/ad-policies/), and [custom creative tools
submission guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-
guidelines) so please read each of them carefully. [CLS] [SEP] among other things, that
means your order for snap to run a creative tool is subject to the disclaimers
and limitations of liability in the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service](/en-
us/terms/#terms-us). [CLS] [SEP] please also review our [privacy policy](/en-
us/privacy/privacy-policy/) to learn how we handle information when you use
the services. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent these terms conflict with the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of
service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us), [community guidelines](/en-us/community-
guidelines), [snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-guidelines/), [snapcode
usage guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-us/article/snapcode-
guidelines), [advertising policies](/en-us/ad-policies/), or [custom creative
tools submission guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-
guidelines), these terms govern. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] the basics

when you submit your order for snap to run a creative tool, you’re asking snap
to let snapchat users put the creative tool on their snaps. [CLS] [SEP] you’ll design the
proposed creative tool and submit it as an image file for our review. [CLS] [SEP] snap may
allow you to edit or replace the image file after submission (the initial
image file, and any edits or replacements, are collectively called the
“asset”). [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you of any additional charges before you submit your
revised or replacement asset. [CLS] [SEP] the version of these terms posted on the website
when you submit an asset will apply to that submission. [CLS] [SEP] you grant snap and our
affiliates a license to use and copy the asset to distribute the creative tool
and for other purposes, as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] and you may be asked
whether you’re buying a personal or business creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms spell out all these steps and include other important provisions,
including details about payment, refunds, and cancellations. [CLS] [SEP] to submit your
order for snap to run a creative tool, you must first accept these terms,
which will be presented to you during the submission process. [CLS] [SEP]

you affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where
you are located when submitting your order) and are competent and authorized
to agree to and abide by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to submit an order for snap
to run a creative tool and are under the age of majority, you must have your
parent’s express permission. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are using the services on behalf of a business, you affirm that you are
authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these terms and to agree to
these terms on behalf of the business. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the terms “you” and
“your,” as used throughout these terms, apply to both you and the business, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

as part of the purchase process, you’ll be asked to submit the asset for our
review. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that snap will determine, in our sole
discretion, whether the asset will be made available as a creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] your license to us

you grant snap and its affiliates a non-exclusive, unrestricted,
unconditional, unlimited, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-
free, worldwide license to archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce,
record, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt,
edit, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote,
exhibit, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the asset on or
in connection with the services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion
thereof, in all formats, on or through any means or media now known or
hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter
developed. [CLS] [SEP] this license includes the right for snap and its affiliates to make
the asset available to snapchat users, for sharing among snapchat users, and
for saving to their devices. [CLS] [SEP] the license to make the asset available to
snapchat users as a creative tool within the services extends 90 days
following the date when the creative tool run time on the services ends, in
order to allow us to deliver unopened snaps that include the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]
the license extends perpetually for the limited purposes of advertising,
marketing, and promoting the services, and for personal custom creative tools,
for memories on snapchat. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that snapchat users may be able to save, share, and
view snaps incorporating the creative tool during and beyond the creative
tool’s run time. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that snapchat users may use the asset for
purposes or in ways other than you anticipated. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that such uses
constitute user-generated content for which neither snap nor its affiliates
bear any responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that neither snap nor its affiliates are
liable for any claims or losses based on or arising from any user-generated
content, including user-generated content that makes use of the asset, whether
within the services or beyond. [CLS] [SEP]

if you incorporate your or any third party’s name, logo, trademark, likeness,
image, visual work, music, sound effect, or other materials (collectively,
“additional elements”) into the asset, you agree that this license includes
all additional elements. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that snap and its affiliates own all rights in the
creative tool products and in any additional tools we may make available to
you to create your asset (such as templates or bitmojis). [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that neither snap nor its affiliates are under any obligation to pay
you or any third party any consideration or compensation for the asset or any
use of the asset. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permissible under law, you irrevocably
waive—or agree not to assert against snap and its affiliates to the extent a
waiver is not permitted—any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in
the asset throughout the world. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that snap may in our discretion
resize, set the transparency of, and make other alterations to the asset. [CLS] [SEP]

if snap makes the asset available on the services, you acknowledge and agree
that snap has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the asset to
you, including by posting your name and city, state, and country, as submitted
by you or as tied to your snapchat account. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] asset content restrictions

the asset must comply with our [custom creative tools submission
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-guidelines) and
our [community guidelines](/en-us/community-guidelines) and [advertising
policies](/en-us/ad-policies/). [CLS] [SEP] anything prohibited as ad content by us is
prohibited as a creative tool, and anything restricted as an ad is restricted
as a creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] for inquiries about buying a creative tool that includes a
product listed in the restricted ads category, contact [create-
support@snap.com](/en-us/). [CLS] [SEP]

snap may provide you the option to age-target the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] this means we
may make the creative tool available only to those snapchat users who we
reasonably believe fall within the age range you select in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge and agree that snapchat users who apply age-targeted creative
tools to their snaps will be able to send those snaps to other snapchat users
without age restriction. [CLS] [SEP] if the content of the creative tool requires age-
targeting by law, rule, regulation, or industry standards in the region where
the creative tool will run, you are responsible for selecting the correct age
in the purchase tool, and we will not be liable if you fail to do so. [CLS] [SEP] if a
required age-targeting option is not available, do not submit your order. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] orders, pricing, and availability

a. [CLS] [SEP] orders. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll indicate in the purchase tool the first date when the
creative tool could start to run. [CLS] [SEP]

we may offer you the option to have the creative tool run on an automatically
renewing basis, with recurring billing as indicated in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] if
you select this option, the creative tool may run until cancelled or you
decline to renew the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] pricing. [CLS] [SEP] we price creative tools in our discretion based on a number of
factors, including how long and over how large an area you want the creative
tool to run. [CLS] [SEP] you can see the price adjust as you manipulate the size,
location, and run time for the creative tool in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
offer an option that lets you more generally select a location and time to run
a creative tool, leaving it to us to define the geographic area, duration, and
price. [CLS] [SEP] we may change, suspend, or end any service, or modify prices
prospectively, in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] you’ll always see the final purchase price
before you click to submit your order and enter into a contract with us. [CLS] [SEP] for
automatically renewing creative tool purchases, we will notify you in advance
of any price changes that will take effect at the beginning of the next
renewal period. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permitted by local law, you are deemed to accept
the then-current price if you do not cancel the renewal in accordance with the
cancellation policy then in effect. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to accept the renewal
or the price change, you may cancel prior to the renewal going into effect. [CLS] [SEP]
please be sure to carefully read any notifications we send regarding changes
to price, these terms, and any other offers. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] availability. [CLS] [SEP] snap does not guarantee creative tool availability over all
areas. [CLS] [SEP] keep in mind that we may, and likely will, run multiple creative tools
over any one location. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right in our discretion to block certain
areas without notice. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to section 8 for information relating to
refunds and cancellations. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] our review of the proposed creative tool

when you submit your order, that doesn’t mean the creative tool will be made
available on the services. [CLS] [SEP] snap may reject a proposed creative tool if it
violates the asset content restrictions in section 3, or for any other reason
in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] refunds for rejected orders are described in section 8. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] your purchase and payment

a. [CLS] [SEP] payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] snap accepts a variety of payment methods, as reflected in
the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] before you can submit your order for snap to run a creative
tool, you may be required to provide a valid payment card number and
associated information for a payment card that you are authorized to use,
including any or all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the
card; (ii) the credit or debit card type; (iii) the card’s expiration date;
(iv) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card; and (v) the
billing address or zip code or postal code associated with the card. [CLS] [SEP] you
authorize snap and our payment processor, or your in-app purchasing provider,
as applicable, to use information you submit to charge your card or other
payment method for the price of the creative tool you submitted, in addition
to any taxes, fees, and charges as described in these terms at our
convenience, including as early as at the time the order is submitted. [CLS] [SEP] in the
event the charge does not go through, you may be able to re-submit a payment
method before the creative tool is scheduled to run. [CLS] [SEP]

for automatically renewing creative tools, we’ll charge your payment method
before the renewal time unless the creative tool is cancelled or you decline
to renew the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

your payment will be processed before the creative tool runs. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
paying by payment card, we or our third-party payment processor may run one or
more payment card authorization checks on your card before then. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize
us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information
and, if needed, to continue billing your card until the creative tool run time
has expired to avoid interruptions in running the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

if snap does not receive payment from your payment card or other payment
method issuer or their agent, you remain obligated and agree to pay all
amounts due upon request from snap or our agents. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] account codes/credits. [CLS] [SEP] snap may on occasion provide a code, credit, coupon,
or other form of discount in an amount and on terms and restrictions as
provided by us. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] cost, fees, and taxes. [CLS] [SEP] please confirm that all details of your submission
are correct before submitting your order. [CLS] [SEP] when you submit your order, you
agree to pay the cost of the creative tool, plus applicable taxes, fees, and
charges, and, in the case of automatically renewing creative tools, the then-
current price at the time of renewal (unless the creative tool is cancelled or
you decline to renew the creative tool). [CLS] [SEP] if united states sales and use taxes
are owed but not included in the total amount you agree to pay, snap or your
in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, will pay those sales or use taxes
and remit them to the appropriate taxing authority. [CLS] [SEP] failure to pay the cost
stated may result in termination or suspension of the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or
promotional offering. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your
submission, at the rates in effect when the fees and charges were incurred. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, if you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based
outside the united states, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees
and other similar fees. [CLS] [SEP]

d. [CLS] [SEP] other payment terms. [CLS] [SEP] your payment card issuer agreement governs your use of
your designated card, and your in-app purchasing provider’s terms govern your
use of in-app purchasing tools. [CLS] [SEP] you must refer to your agreements with those
third parties, and not these terms, to determine the rights and liabilities as
between you and those third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for paying any unauthorized amounts billed to your payment
method by a third party. [CLS] [SEP]

except for an in-app submission, unless you notify us of any discrepancies
within 60 days after they first appear on your payment card or other payment
statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] communications from us

when you submit your order for snap to run a creative tool, we’ll send you an
electronic notification using the contact information submitted by you, or
tied to your snapchat account, as applicable. [CLS] [SEP] that confirmation does not mean
we’ve accepted your submission. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to accept or decline your
request for any reason and at any time, including after the creative tool has
started to run. [CLS] [SEP] we may require additional verifications or information before
accepting any order. [CLS] [SEP]

we may send you other electronic notifications about the creative tool order,
including about status, payment processing, refunds, price changes for
automatically renewing creative tools, and any changes, updates, or
cancellations to your order. [CLS] [SEP] we may also send electronic notifications about
the creative tool products or our other products or services. [CLS] [SEP] by submitting an
order for snap to run a creative tool, you consent to receive from snap and
its affiliates the electronic communications described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
communications be in writing. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations and refunds

a. [CLS] [SEP] our right to cancel. [CLS] [SEP] snap reserves the right to reject or cancel the
creative tool at any time, including after the creative tool has started to
run, because we’ve blocked a certain area (see section 4), because you or the
creative tool violate our terms or guidelines (see sections 3 and 5), because
payment is not completed, or for any other reason in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] moreover,
while we do our best to describe our products as accurately as possible, we do
not warrant that specifications or pricing are complete, accurate, current, or
error-free. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any pricing or specification error, we have the
right to refuse or cancel your order in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if we cancel your
order for an automatically renewing creative tool, you will not be charged for
that creative tool after the date of cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] refunds for cancellations
are addressed below. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] your right to cancel. [CLS] [SEP] you may cancel the creative tool any time after you
submit your order. [CLS] [SEP] contact [create-support@snap.com](/en-us/), or use any
“cancel” functionality made available by snap, to cancel or decline to renew
the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel the creative tool, you may be eligible for a
full or partial refund, as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] refunds. [CLS] [SEP]

(i) in-app submissions: refunds for in-app submissions are controlled by your
in-app purchasing provider. [CLS] [SEP] please contact your in-app purchasing provider for
details. [CLS] [SEP]

(ii) other submissions: if you or we cancel the creative tool before it runs
on the services, you’ll receive a full refund of payments you already made for
that creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] other than for automatically renewing creative tools, if
you or we cancel the creative tool while it’s running, we may provide a
partial refund so that you’ll only pay for the time the creative tool ran. [CLS] [SEP]
refunds for cancellations of automatically renewing creative tool are governed
by the additional terms you agreed to at the time of submission. [CLS] [SEP] for all
refunds by snap to payment cards, please allow 3-5 business days for the funds
to appear in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order, your sole and
exclusive remedy is either: (1) we’ll issue a credit to the payment method
used for that order in an amount equal to the cancelled portion of the order;
or (2) we won’t charge you for the cancelled portion of the order. [CLS] [SEP] as stated
above, you’ll be responsible for, and your payment method may be charged for,
all fees associated with orders already processed before your cancellation was
received. [CLS] [SEP]

d. [CLS] [SEP] survival of terms. [CLS] [SEP] the introduction and sections 2, 6-8, 12-13, and 15-18
of these terms will survive the termination of these terms and the expiration
of the licenses granted in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] delivery of the creative tool

if we accept your order we will make the creative tool available as requested
by you in your submission, unless we cannot do so for reasons outside of our
control or for other reasons as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we do not guarantee
perfect delivery, and we do not guarantee that any snapchat users will choose
to use the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

after you submit the asset, snap may provide you a scannable code
(“snapcode”). [CLS] [SEP] your use of that snapcode must be in compliance with the
[snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-guidelines/) and [snapcode usage
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-us/article/snapcode-guidelines). [CLS] [SEP]
snapchat users may be given the option to access the creative tool by scanning
the snapcode or through other means provided by snap (each, an “unlock”). [CLS] [SEP] any
snapchat user may unlock the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] snap reserves the right to
deactivate the unlock and redirect the unlock, each at snap’s sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] business creative tools and advertising

before you submit the asset, snap may ask you whether the creative tool is
personal or for a business. [CLS] [SEP] click “business” (a) if you’re submitting the
asset on behalf of a business; (b) if the asset includes any branding, logos,
or business marks or names; or (c) if the asset promotes a business or brand. [CLS] [SEP]
we refer to creative tools that include these types of assets as “business
custom creative tools.” we refer to other creative tools as “personal custom
creative tools.” you agree that you will not use any branding, logos, or
business marks or names, or promote a business or brand, in any personal
custom creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] when submitting an asset for a business custom creative
tool, you agree to include the accurate business name. [CLS] [SEP]

we may in our sole discretion apply a label or disclosure to notify snapchat
users that the creative tool is a purchased product. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the word
“sponsored” or a similar word or phrase may appear on the creative tool when
users first see it. [CLS] [SEP] that’s one reason it’s very important that you click
“business” if the creative tool in fact promotes a business or brand. [CLS] [SEP] we may
in our sole discretion include in that label or disclosure the name you
provided in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] you, not we, are responsible for including any
legally required advertising disclosure in the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

snap or its affiliates may, without compensation to you or others, serve or
otherwise place ads near the creative tools. [CLS] [SEP] for example, snapchat users
swiping to see snapchat’s creative tool offerings may see a branded or
sponsored creative tool before or after the creative tool you’ve submitted, or
a snapchat user may apply the creative tool to their content and that content
may include or be followed or preceded by an ad or other branded or sponsored
content within the services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] promotions

if you use the creative tool or any part of the services as part of a
sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a “promotion”), you are
solely responsible for complying with all laws wherever your promotion is
offered, as well as with our [promotions
rules](https://support.snapchat.com/a/promotions-rules). [CLS] [SEP] unless we expressly
agree otherwise in writing, snap will not be a sponsor or an administrator of
your promotion. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] your representations and warranties

in addition to your representations and warranties under the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms
of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us), you represent and warrant that (a) you
have all rights and any necessary consents to license the asset and any
additional elements incorporated into the asset, and to grant any waivers in
connection with the asset and any additional elements incorporated into the
asset, to snap and its affiliates; (b) the asset does not violate these terms
or our [community guidelines](/en-us/community-guidelines), [advertising
policies](/en-us/ad-policies/), or [custom creative tools submission
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-guidelines); (c)
the asset does not, and its use in connection with the services will not,

you have not assigned, licensed, or otherwise encumbered the asset to any
other person or entity; (e) the asset complies with all laws, rules, and
regulations and is suitable for audiences ages 13 and up (or the ages you’ve
age-targeted via the purchase tool, if applicable); (f) the asset does not,
and will not, defame, bully, cause injury or harm to, or inflict emotional
distress on, any third party; (g) any and all information you have provided to
snap in connection with the asset and your submission is accurate and correct;
and (h) you will not use any payment card or other form of payment to submit
an order for snap to run a creative tool unless you have all necessary legal
authorization to do so. [CLS] [SEP] in the event snap approves and uses the asset, such
approval and use will not diminish or waive your representations and
warranties contained in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you further represent and warrant that (a) neither you, nor, if you are a
business, any affiliated company, are included on any of the restricted party
lists maintained by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government -- including the specially designated
nationals list and foreign sanctions evaders list administered by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
department of treasury’s office of foreign asset control (“ofac”) and the
denied parties list, unverified list, and entity list maintained by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security -- or by any
government authority in the countries where you operate; (b) if you are a
business, you are not owned or controlled by such a restricted party; and (c)
you are not resident in, located in, or organized under the laws of any
country with which trade is prohibited by ofac or other applicable sanctions. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are using the services on behalf of a business, you further represent
and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business with the
authority to bind the business to these terms and agree on behalf of the
business to be bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] your indemnification to us

in addition to your indemnification obligations under the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of
service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us), you agree, to the extent permitted by law,
to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless snap, its affiliates, directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any
and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in
any way to (a) snap’s use and any third party’s use of the asset, including
the additional elements, if any, in connection with the services; (b) your use
of the services and your activities in connection with the services; (c) your
violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, and regulations in
connection with your use of the services or your activities in connection with
the services; (d) any claim that the asset infringes, violates, or
misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, design right, trade
dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (e)
your use of products or services provided by a third party in connection with
the services, even if recommended or approved by snap; (f) any fraud or
misrepresentation by you; or (g) any violation or alleged violation of these
terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations,
warranties, and obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] no agency relationship

nothing in these terms will be construed to imply a joint venture, principal-
agent, or employment relationship between you and us or our affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] governing law and disputes between you and snap

these terms are governed by the [choice of law](/en-us/terms/#choice-of-law)
provision and [exclusive venue](/en-us/terms/#exclusive-venue) provision of
the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us). [CLS] [SEP]

arbitration notification: except for certain types of disputes mentioned in
the [arbitration](/en-us/terms/#arbitration) provision of the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms
of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-us), you and snap agree that claims and
disputes, including statutory claims and disputes, arising between us will be
resolved by mandatory binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration
procedures set forth in the arbitration provision of the snap inc. [CLS] [SEP] terms of
service, and you agree to waive any right to participate in a class-action
lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

# snap group limited custom creative tools terms

(if you are located outside the united states)

effective: may 10, 2018

 **arbitration notice: if you’re using the services on behalf of a business,
then your business will be bound by the**[ **arbitration**](/en-
us/terms/custom-creative-tools#arbitration-row) **provision that appears later
in these terms.**

## introduction

please read these snap group limited custom creative tools terms (“terms”)
carefully. [CLS] [SEP] these terms form a legally binding contract between you (or your
organization) and snap group limited (“snap”), and govern your order for snap
to run a lens or filter (each, a “creative tool”). [CLS] [SEP] the products and services
described in these terms are “services” as defined in the [snap group limited
terms of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-row). [CLS] [SEP] if you are located outside the
united states when you submit an order for snap to run a creative tool, or if
you are using the services on behalf of a business with its principal place of
business located outside the united states, these terms govern your order. [CLS] [SEP] if
you are located in the united states when you submit an order for snap to run
a creative tool or are using the services on behalf of a business with its
principal place of business located in the united states, the [snap inc. [CLS] [SEP]
custom creative tools terms](/en-us/terms/custom-creative-tools/#terms-us)
apply. [CLS] [SEP]

additional terms specific to the country in which you are located when you
submit an order to buy a creative tool, or if you are using the services on
behalf of a business, the country in which the business's principal place of
business is located, may apply; please see the end of these terms for country-
specific terms that may apply. [CLS] [SEP]

please print a copy of these terms and keep them for your reference. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms incorporate by reference the [snap group limited terms of
service](/en-us/terms/#terms-row), [community guidelines](/en-us/community-
guidelines), [snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-guidelines/), [snapcode
usage guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-us/article/snapcode-
guidelines), [advertising policies](/en-us/ad-policies/), and [custom creative
tools submission guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-
guidelines) so please read each of them carefully. [CLS] [SEP] among other things, that
means your order for snap to run a creative tool is subject to the disclaimers
and limitations of liability in the [snap group limited terms of service](/en-
us/terms/#terms-row). [CLS] [SEP] please also review our [privacy policy](/en-
us/privacy/privacy-policy/) to learn how we handle information when you use
the services. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent these terms conflict with the [snap group limited
terms of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-row), [community guidelines](/en-
us/community-guidelines), [snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-
guidelines/), [snapcode usage guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-
us/article/snapcode-guidelines), [advertising policies](/en-us/ad-policies/),
or [custom creative tools submission
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-guidelines), these
terms govern. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] the basics

when you submit your order for snap to run a creative tool, you’re asking snap
to let snapchat users put the creative tool on their snaps. [CLS] [SEP] you’ll design the
proposed creative tool and submit it as an image file for our review. [CLS] [SEP] snap may
allow you to edit or replace the image file after submission (the initial
image file, and any edits or replacements, are collectively called the
“asset”). [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you of any additional charges before you submit your
revised or replacement asset. [CLS] [SEP] the version of these terms posted on the website
when you submit an asset will apply to that submission. [CLS] [SEP] you grant snap and our
affiliates a license to use and copy the asset to distribute the creative tool
and for other purposes, as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] and you may be asked
whether you’re buying a personal or business creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms spell out all these steps and include other important provisions,
including details about payment, refunds, and cancellations. [CLS] [SEP] to submit your
order for snap to run a creative tool, you must first accept these terms,
which will be presented to you during the submission process. [CLS] [SEP]

you affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where
you are located when submitting your order) and are competent and authorized
to agree to and abide by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to submit an order for snap
to run a creative tool and are under the age of majority, you must have your
parent’s express permission. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are using the services on behalf of a business, you affirm that you are
authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these terms and to agree to
these terms on behalf of the business. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the terms “you” and
“your,” as used throughout these terms, apply to both you and the business, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

as part of the purchase process, you’ll be asked to submit the asset for our
review. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that snap will determine, in our sole
discretion, whether the asset will be made available as a creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] your license to us

you grant snap, snap inc., and their affiliates a non-exclusive, transferable,
sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to communicate to the public,
archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense,
distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, publicly
display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote, exhibit, create
derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the asset on or in connection
with the services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in
all formats, on or through any means or media now known or hereafter
developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter
developed. [CLS] [SEP] this license includes the right for snap, snap inc., and their
affiliates to make the asset available to snapchat users, for sharing among
snapchat users, and for saving to their devices. [CLS] [SEP] the license to make the asset
available to snapchat users as a creative tool within the services extends 90
days following the date when the creative tool run time on the services ends,
in order to allow us to deliver unopened snaps that include the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]
for personal custom creative tools, this license extends so long as the
creative tool is available in memories. [CLS] [SEP] the license continues for the limited
purposes of advertising, marketing, and promoting the services. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that snapchat users may be able to save, share, and
view snaps incorporating the creative tool during and beyond the creative
tool’s run time. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that snapchat users may use the asset for
purposes or in ways other than you anticipated. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that such uses
constitute user-generated content for which neither snap, snap inc., nor their
affiliates bear any responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that neither snap, snap inc.,
nor their affiliates are liable for any claims or losses based on or arising
from any user-generated content, including user-generated content that makes
use of the asset, whether within the services or beyond. [CLS] [SEP]

if you incorporate your or any third party’s name, logo, trademark, likeness,
image, visual work, music, sound effect, or other materials (collectively,
“additional elements”) into the asset, you agree that this license includes
all additional elements. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that snap, snap inc., and their affiliates own all
rights in the creative tool products and in any additional tools we may make
available to you to create your asset (such as templates or bitmojis). [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that neither snap, snap inc., nor their affiliates are under any
obligation to pay you or any third party any consideration or compensation for
the asset or any use of the asset. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permissible under law, you
irrevocably waive—or agree not to assert against snap, snap inc., and their
affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted—any moral rights or
equivalent rights you may have in the asset throughout the world. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that snap may in our discretion resize, set the transparency of, and make
other alterations to the asset. [CLS] [SEP]

if snap makes the asset available on the services, you acknowledge and agree
that snap has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the asset to
you, including by posting your name and city, state, and country, as submitted
by you or as tied to your snapchat account. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] asset content restrictions

the asset must comply with our [custom creative tools submission
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-guidelines) and
our [community guidelines](/en-us/community-guidelines) and [advertising
policies](/en-us/ad-policies/). [CLS] [SEP] anything prohibited as ad content by us is
prohibited as a creative tool, and anything restricted as an ad is restricted
as a creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] for inquiries about buying a creative tool that includes a
product listed in the restricted ads category, contact [create-
support@snap.com](/en-us/). [CLS] [SEP]

snap may provide you the option to age-target the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] this means we
may make the creative tool available only to those snapchat users who we
reasonably believe fall within the age range you select in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge and agree that snapchat users who apply age-targeted creative
tools to their snaps will be able to send those snaps to other snapchat users
without age restriction. [CLS] [SEP] if the content of the creative tool requires age-
targeting by law, rule, regulation, or industry standards in the region where
the creative tool will run, you are responsible for selecting the correct age
in the purchase tool, and we will not be liable if you fail to do so. [CLS] [SEP] if a
required age-targeting option is not available, do not submit your order. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] orders, pricing, and availability

a. [CLS] [SEP] orders. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll indicate in the purchase tool the first date when the
creative tool could start to run. [CLS] [SEP]

we may offer you the option to have the creative tool run on an automatically
renewing basis, with recurring billing as indicated in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] if
you select this option, the creative tool may run until cancelled or you
decline to renew the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] pricing. [CLS] [SEP] we price creative tools in our discretion based on a number of
factors, including how long and over how large an area you want the creative
tool to run. [CLS] [SEP] you can see the price adjust as you manipulate the size,
location, and run time for the creative tool in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
offer an option that lets you more generally select a location and time to run
a creative tool, leaving it to us to define the geographic area, duration, and
price. [CLS] [SEP] we may change, suspend, or end any service, or modify prices
prospectively, in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] you’ll always see the final purchase price
before you click to submit your order and enter into a contract with us. [CLS] [SEP] for
automatically renewing creative tool purchases, we will notify you in advance
of any price changes that will take effect at the beginning of the next
renewal period. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permitted by local law, you are deemed to accept
the then-current price if you do not cancel the renewal in accordance with the
cancellation policy then in effect. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to accept the renewal
or the price change, you may cancel prior to the renewal going into effect. [CLS] [SEP]
please be sure to carefully read any notifications we send regarding changes
to price, these terms, and any other offers. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] availability. [CLS] [SEP] snap does not guarantee creative tool availability over all
areas. [CLS] [SEP] keep in mind that we may, and likely will, run multiple creative tools
over any one location. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right in our discretion to block certain
areas without notice. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to section 8 for information relating to
refunds and cancellations. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] our review of the proposed creative tool

when you submit your order, that doesn’t mean the creative tool will be made
available on the services. [CLS] [SEP] snap may reject a proposed creative tool if it
violates the asset content restrictions in section 3, or for any other reason
in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] refunds for rejected orders are described in section 8. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] your purchase and payment

a. [CLS] [SEP] payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] snap accepts a variety of payment methods, as reflected in
the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] before you can submit your order for snap to run a creative
tool, you may be required to provide a valid payment card number and
associated information for a payment card that you are authorized to use,
including any or all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the
card; (ii) the credit or debit card type; (iii) the card’s expiration date;
(iv) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card; and (v) the
billing address or zip code or postal code associated with the card. [CLS] [SEP] you
authorize snap and our payment processor, or your in-app purchasing provider,
as applicable, to use information you submit to charge your card or other
payment method for the price of the creative tool you submitted, in addition
to any taxes, fees, and charges as described in these terms at our
convenience, including as early as at the time the order is submitted. [CLS] [SEP] in the
event the charge does not go through, you may be able to re-submit a payment
method before the creative tool is scheduled to run. [CLS] [SEP]

for automatically renewing creative tools, we’ll charge your payment method
before the renewal time unless the creative tool is cancelled or you decline
to renew the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

your payment will be processed before the creative tool runs. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
paying by payment card, we or our third-party payment processor may run one or
more payment card authorization checks on your card before then. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize
us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information
and, if needed, to continue billing your card until the creative tool run time
has expired to avoid interruptions in running the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

if snap does not receive payment from your payment card or other payment
method issuer or their agent, you remain obligated and agree to pay all
amounts due upon request from snap or our agents. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] account codes/credits. [CLS] [SEP] snap may on occasion provide a code, credit, coupon,
or other form of discount in an amount and on terms and restrictions as
provided by us. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] cost, fees, and taxes. [CLS] [SEP] please confirm that all details of your purchase are
correct before submitting your order. [CLS] [SEP] when you submit your order, you agree to
pay the cost of the creative tool (and, in the case of automatically renewing
creative tools, the then-current price at the time of renewal unless the
creative tool is cancelled or you decline to renew), plus any taxes, fees, and
charges applicable to that order at the rates in effect when incurred, free of
any withholding or deduction for taxes (“charges”). [CLS] [SEP] failure to pay the cost
stated may result in termination or suspension of the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or
promotional offering. [CLS] [SEP]

if your personal custom creative tool order is subject to taxes (including
value-added or goods and services taxes), snap or your in-app purchasing
provider, as applicable, will remit those taxes to the appropriate taxing
authority. [CLS] [SEP]

if your business custom creative tool order is subject to taxes (including
value-added or goods and services taxes) and you are required by applicable
law to remit and report those taxes, you agree to remit and report such taxes
to the appropriate taxing authority. [CLS] [SEP] if you are required to withhold or deduct
any taxes, you will pay to snap or your in-app purchasing provider, as
applicable, any additional amount necessary so that snap or your in-app
purchasing provider, as applicable, receives a net amount equal to the
charges. [CLS] [SEP] you will also provide snap an official tax receipt or other
appropriate documentation supporting the withholding. [CLS] [SEP]

please see section 19 for tax information specific to your country. [CLS] [SEP]

d. [CLS] [SEP] other payment terms. [CLS] [SEP] your payment card issuer agreement governs your use of
your designated card, and your in-app purchasing provider’s terms govern your
use of in-app purchasing tools. [CLS] [SEP] you must refer to your agreements with those
third parties, and not these terms, to determine the rights and liabilities as
between you and those third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any payment-related issues
with in-app submissions, please contact your in-app purchasing provider
directly. [CLS] [SEP] if you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based
outside the united states, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees
and other similar fees. [CLS] [SEP]

 **you are responsible for paying any unauthorized amounts billed to your
payment method by a third party.**

except for an in-app submission, unless you notify us of any discrepancies
within 60 days after they first appear on your payment card or other payment
statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] communications from us

when you submit your order for snap to run a creative tool, we’ll send you an
electronic notification using the contact information submitted by you, or
tied to your snapchat account, as applicable. [CLS] [SEP] that confirmation does not mean
we’ve accepted your submission. [CLS] [SEP] we may require additional verifications or
information before accepting any order. [CLS] [SEP]

we may send you other electronic notifications about the creative tool order,
including about status, payment processing, refunds, price changes for
automatically renewing creative tools, and any changes, updates, or
cancellations to your order. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permitted by law, we may also send
electronic notifications about the creative tool products or our other
products or services. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
communications be in writing. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellations and refunds

a. [CLS] [SEP] our right to cancel. [CLS] [SEP] snap reserves the right to reject or cancel the
creative tool at any time, including after the creative tool has started to
run, because we’ve blocked a certain area (see section 4), because you or the
creative tool violate our terms or guidelines or the law (see sections 3 and
5), or because payment is not completed. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, while we do our best to
describe our products as accurately as possible, we do not warrant that
specifications or pricing are complete, accurate, current, or error-free. [CLS] [SEP] in
the event of any pricing or specification error, we have the right to refuse
or cancel your order in our sole discretion, subject to your right to a refund
if applicable under section 8(c) below. [CLS] [SEP] if we cancel your order for an
automatically renewing creative tool, you will not be charged for that
creative tool after the date of cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] refunds for cancellations are
addressed below. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] your right to cancel. [CLS] [SEP] you may cancel the creative tool any time after you
submit your order. [CLS] [SEP] contact [create-support@snap.com](/en-us/), or use any
“cancel” functionality made available by snap, to cancel or decline to renew
the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel the creative tool, you may be eligible for a
full or partial refund, as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] refunds. [CLS] [SEP]

(i) in-app submissions: refunds for in-app submissions are controlled by your
in-app purchasing provider. [CLS] [SEP] please contact your in-app purchasing provider for
details. [CLS] [SEP]

(ii) other submissions: if you or we cancel the creative tool before it runs
on the services, you’ll receive a full refund of payments you already made for
that creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] other than for automatically renewing creative tools, if
you or we cancel the creative tool while it’s running, we may provide a
partial refund so that you’ll only pay for the time the creative tool ran. [CLS] [SEP]
refunds for cancellations of automatically renewing creative tool are governed
by the additional terms you agreed to at the time of submission. [CLS] [SEP] for all
refunds by snap to payment cards, please allow 3-5 business days for the funds
to appear in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order, you will be
entitled to the following remedy, either: (1) we’ll issue a credit to the
payment method used for that order in an amount equal to the cancelled portion
of the order; or (2) we won’t charge you for the cancelled portion of the
order. [CLS] [SEP] as stated above, you’ll be responsible for, and your payment method may
be charged for, all fees associated with orders already processed before your
cancellation was received. [CLS] [SEP]

d. [CLS] [SEP] survival of terms. [CLS] [SEP] the introduction and sections 2, 6-8, 12-13, and 15-19
of these terms will survive the termination of these terms and the expiration
of the licenses granted in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] delivery of the creative tool

if we accept your order we will make the creative tool available as requested
by you in your submission, unless we cannot do so for reasons outside of our
control or for other reasons as described in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we do not guarantee
perfect delivery, and we do not guarantee that any snapchat users will choose
to use the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

after you submit the asset, snap may provide you a scannable code
(“snapcode”). [CLS] [SEP] your use of that snapcode must be in compliance with the
[snapchat brand guidelines](/en-us/brand-guidelines/) and [snapcode usage
guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/en-us/article/snapcode-guidelines). [CLS] [SEP]
snapchat users may be given the option to access the creative tool by scanning
the snapcode or through other means provided by snap (each, an “unlock”). [CLS] [SEP] any
snapchat user may unlock the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] snap reserves the right to
deactivate the unlock and redirect the unlock, each at snap’s sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] business creative tools and advertising

before you submit the asset, snap may ask you whether the creative tool is
personal or for a business. [CLS] [SEP] click “business” (a) if you’re submitting the
asset on behalf of a business; (b) if the asset includes any branding, logos,
or business marks or names; or (c) if the asset promotes a business or brand. [CLS] [SEP]
we refer to creative tools that include these types of assets as “business
custom creative tools.” we refer to other creative tools as “personal custom
creative tools.” you agree that you will not use any branding, logos, or
business marks or names, or promote a business or brand, in any personal
custom creative tool. [CLS] [SEP] when submitting an asset for a business custom creative
tool, you agree to include the accurate business name. [CLS] [SEP]

we may in our sole discretion apply a label or disclosure to notify snapchat
users that the creative tool is a purchased product. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the word
“sponsored” or a similar word or phrase may appear on the creative tool when
users first see it. [CLS] [SEP] that’s one reason it’s very important that you click
“business” if the creative tool in fact promotes a business or brand. [CLS] [SEP] we may
in our sole discretion include in that label or disclosure the name you
provided in the purchase tool. [CLS] [SEP] you, not we, are responsible for including any
legally required advertising disclosure in the creative tool. [CLS] [SEP]

snap, snap inc., or their affiliates may, without compensation to you or
others, serve or otherwise place ads near the creative tools. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
snapchat users swiping to see snapchat’s creative tool offerings may see a
branded or sponsored creative tool before or after the creative tool you’ve
submitted, or a snapchat user may apply the creative tool to their content and
that content may include or be followed or preceded by an ad or other branded
or sponsored content within the services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] promotions

if you use the creative tool or any part of the services as part of a
sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a “promotion”), you are
solely responsible for complying with all laws wherever your promotion is
offered, as well as with our [promotions
rules](https://support.snapchat.com/a/promotions-rules). [CLS] [SEP] unless we expressly
agree otherwise in writing, snap will not be a sponsor or an administrator of
your promotion. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] your representations and warranties

in addition to your representations and warranties under the [snap group
limited terms of service](/en-us/terms/#terms-row), you represent and warrant
that (a) you have all rights and any necessary consents to license the asset
and any additional elements incorporated into the asset, and to grant any
waivers in connection with the asset and any additional elements incorporated
into the asset, to snap, snap inc., and their affiliates; (b) the asset does
not violate these terms or our [community guidelines](/en-us/community-
guidelines), [advertising policies](/en-us/ad-policies/), or [custom creative
tools submission guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/submission-
guidelines); (c) the asset does not, and its use in connection with the
services will not, violate, misappropriate, or infringe any patent, copyright,
trademark, privacy, or publicity rights, or any other rights of any person or
entity; (d) you have not assigned, licensed, or otherwise encumbered the asset
to any other person or entity; (e) the asset complies with all laws, rules,
and regulations and is suitable for audiences ages 13 and up (or the ages
you’ve age-targeted via the purchase tool, if applicable); (f) the asset does
not, and will not, defame, bully, cause injury or harm to, or inflict
emotional distress on, any third party; (g) any and all information you have
provided to snap in connection with the asset and your submission is accurate
and correct; and (h) you will not use any payment card or other form of
payment to submit an order for snap to run a creative tool unless you have all
necessary legal authorization to do so. [CLS] [SEP] in the event snap approves and uses
the asset, such approval and use will not diminish or waive your
representations and warranties contained in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you further represent and warrant that neither you, nor, if you are a
business, any affiliated company, are included on any restricted party list
maintained by the united states, united kingdom, or other relevant government
authority -- for example, the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] specially designated nationals list,
foreign sanctions evaders list, denied parties list, unverified list, and
entity list, and the uk and eu consolidated lists of persons and entities
subject to financial sanctions targets; that if you are a business, you are
