 **for grammarly business and grammarly edu customers: if your organization
signed an offline agreement for the use of grammarly business or grammarly
edu, then your offline agreement governs your organization’s use of
grammarly’s site, software, and services.**

together with its subsidiaries and other affiliates, grammarly, inc., a
delaware corporation (“grammarly”), makes available the “site” (websites
including, without limitation, www.grammarly.com and all subdomains),
“software” (software and mobile applications), and “services” (including,
without limitation, writing feedback suggestions and/or corrections,
plagiarism detection, and human proofreading services) to help people
communicate more effectively. [CLS] [SEP] access to and use of grammarly’s existing site,
software and services, as well as any future sites, software or services
provided by grammarly are governed by this terms of service and license
agreement (this “agreement”). [CLS] [SEP]

this is a legally binding agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not understand this agreement,
or do not agree to be bound by it or the privacy policy referenced herein, you
must immediately leave the site and you are not authorized to access or use
any of the services or software. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing or using the site, services

are legally able to enter into this agreement, and that you have read,
understand and agree to be bound by this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an individual subscriber, or are accessing the site to use a trial
(as defined below) of the services or software, or are otherwise browsing the
site, this agreement is between you, individually, and grammarly. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an employee, faculty member or student of a university, school or
other entity or organization that has subscribed to the services and software

subscriber and (i) you represent that you have your enterprise subscriber’s
permission and authority to use the site, services, software and your
enterprise subscriber’s “user content” (as defined below) subject to this
agreement, (ii) this agreement is an agreement between you, individually, and
grammarly, and (iii) your enterprise subscriber is jointly responsible for

(2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive,

such third parties access to your pertinent credit card and other personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] such third parties may only use such personal information for
purposes of performing risk control and fraud detection/prevention activities
for us. [CLS] [SEP] however, they may also convert such personal information into hashed
or encoded representations of such information to be used for statistical
and/or fraud prevention purposes. [CLS] [SEP] by initiating any such transaction, you
hereby consent to the foregoing disclosure and use of your information. [CLS] [SEP]

grammarly and its affiliates and licensors, as applicable, and that the

to time provide grammarly with suggestions, comments, recommendations,
improvements, solutions, bug fixes, features, concepts, techniques, ideas,
know-how and/or any feedback regarding the services, the software, the site
and/or any of grammarly’s related technologies (“feedback”). [CLS] [SEP] any and all
feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. [CLS] [SEP] as between the you,
grammarly and, if applicable, your enterprise subscriber, all feedback shall
be exclusively owned by grammarly, and you hereby make all assignments
necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership, and as a result grammarly
shall be freely entitled to reproduce, prepare derivative works, disclose to
third parties, display and perform (publicly or otherwise), sell, lease,
license, distribute and otherwise use and exploit any and all such feedback as
it deems appropriate, at its sole discretion, without obligation or liability

expenses) relating to any claim or demand made by any third party due to or
arising out of your access to the site, use of the services or software,
violation of this agreement, or infringement of any intellectual property or
other right of any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california resident, you
waive california civil code section 1542, which says: “a general release does
not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” if you are a
resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or
doctrine. [CLS] [SEP]

## warranty disclaimers

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, grammarly, its licensors
and its suppliers expressly disclaim any and all warranties and conditions,
express or implied, regarding the site, services, and software, including, but
not limited to, any implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title,
noninfringement, satisfactory quality or arising from a course of dealing,
law, usage, or trade practice, or regarding security, quiet enjoyment,
reliability, timeliness and performance. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that your use of the site,
services and software are at your own sole risk and that the site, services
and any software are provided on an “as is,” “where is,” “as available,” “with
all faults” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. [CLS] [SEP]
without limiting the foregoing, grammarly and its licensors and its suppliers
do not warrant that the operation of the site, services and/or software will
meet your requirements or will be uninterrupted or error-free. [CLS] [SEP]

## limitation of liability

in no event shall grammarly be liable with respect to the site, services and/
or software for (i) any amount in the aggregate in excess of the fees you have
actually paid to grammarly during the twelve (12) month period immediately
preceding the event(s) giving rise to such liability; (ii) any lost profits,
lost or damaged user content or other data, or failure to meet any duty,
including without limitation good faith and reasonable care; or (iii) any
indirect, incidental, punitive, special, exemplary or consequential damages of
any kind whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation
of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between
grammarly and you. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that the site, services and software would
not be provided without such limitations. [CLS] [SEP]

certain states do not allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all
of this limitation of liability may not apply to you and you may have
additional rights. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a user from new jersey, the foregoing sections titled “warranty
disclaimers” and “limitation of liability” are intended to be only as broad as
is permitted under the laws of the state of new jersey. [CLS] [SEP] if any portion of
these sections is held to be invalid under the laws of the state of new
jersey, the invalidity of such portion shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of the applicable sections. [CLS] [SEP]

## dispute resolution by binding arbitration

please read this section carefully as it affects your rights. [CLS] [SEP]

#### a. [CLS] [SEP] agreement to arbitrate

this section titled “dispute resolution by binding arbitration” is referred to
in this agreement as the “arbitration agreement.” you agree that any and all
disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and grammarly,
whether arising out of or relating to this agreement (including any alleged
breach thereof), the site, software or services, any advertising or any aspect
of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively
through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with
the terms of this arbitration agreement, except that you may assert individual
claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. [CLS] [SEP] further, this
arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the
attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the
law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that, by entering
into this agreement, you and grammarly are each waiving the right to a trial
by jury or to participate in a class action. [CLS] [SEP] your rights will be determined by
a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act governs
the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### b. [CLS] [SEP] prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized
relief

you and grammarly agree that each of us may bring claims against the other
only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class or representative action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] unless both you and
grammarly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more
than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any
form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] also, the
arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory
relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual
claim(s). [CLS] [SEP]

#### c. [CLS] [SEP] pre-arbitration dispute resolution

grammarly is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently,
and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s
satisfaction by emailing customer support at
[support@grammarly.com](mailto:support%40grammarly.com). [CLS] [SEP] if such efforts prove
unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute (“notice”). [CLS] [SEP] the notice
to grammarly should be sent to 548 market street, #35410, san francisco, ca
94104, attn: operations department (“notice address”). [CLS] [SEP] the notice must (i)
describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
specific relief sought. [CLS] [SEP] if grammarly and you do not resolve the claim within
sixty (60) calendar days after the notice is received, you or grammarly may
commence an arbitration proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] during the arbitration, the amount of any
settlement offer made by grammarly or you shall not be disclosed to the
arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which
you or grammarly is entitled. [CLS] [SEP]

#### d. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration procedures

arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
american arbitration association’s (“aaa”) rules and procedures, including the
aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes (collectively,
the “aaa rules”), as modified by this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] for information
on the aaa, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP] information about
the aaa rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the aaa’s
consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if there
is any inconsistency between any term of the aaa rules and any term of this
arbitration agreement, the applicable terms of this arbitration agreement will
control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
inconsistent arbitration agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally
fair arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this
agreement as a court would. [CLS] [SEP] all issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability,
and arbitrability of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] although arbitration
proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on
an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this
agreement and applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in
court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. [CLS] [SEP]

unless grammarly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take
place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] if
the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made
by aaa. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim is for $10,000 or less, grammarly agrees that you may
choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an
in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim exceeds
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]
regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
findings and conclusions on which the award is based. [CLS] [SEP]

#### e. [CLS] [SEP] costs of arbitration

payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
“arbitration fees”) will be governed by the aaa rules, unless otherwise
provided in this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of the relief sought is
$75,000 or less, at your request, grammarly will pay all arbitration fees. [CLS] [SEP] if
the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your
portion of the arbitration fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for
any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the
arbitration fees, grammarly will pay your portion of such fees. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be
prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, grammarly will pay as much
of the arbitration fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. [CLS] [SEP] finally, if the value of the relief
sought is $75,000 or less, grammarly will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees
should you prevail. [CLS] [SEP] grammarly will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. [CLS] [SEP] but, if
you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the
payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

#### f. [CLS] [SEP] confidentiality

all aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award
by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

#### g. [CLS] [SEP] severability

without limiting the severability provision in the section titled “general
provisions” of this agreement, if a court or the arbitrator decides that any
term or provision of this arbitration agreement other than clause (b) of this
arbitration agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this arbitration agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. [CLS] [SEP] if a court decides that any of the provisions of
clause (b) of this arbitration agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the
entirety of this arbitration agreement shall be null and void, unless such
provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to
claims for public injunctive relief. [CLS] [SEP] the remainder of this agreement will
continue to apply. [CLS] [SEP]

#### h. [CLS] [SEP] future changes to arbitration agreement

notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, grammarly
agrees that if it makes any future change to this arbitration agreement (other
than a change to the notice address) while you are a user of the services, you
may reject any such change by sending grammarly written notice within thirty
(30) calendar days of the change to the notice address provided above. [CLS] [SEP] by
rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any
dispute between us in accordance with the language of this arbitration
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

## general provisions

this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the state of california, without regard to any choice of law,
conflicts of law or other principles that would result in the applicable of
the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the section
titled “arbitration”, any legal action or proceeding relating to this
agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in san francisco
county, california. [CLS] [SEP] you and grammarly agree to submit to the jurisdiction of,
and agree that venue is proper in, these courts in any such legal action or
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

this agreement and the rights and obligations herein are personal to you, and
you may not assign or otherwise transfer this agreement or any of your rights
or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of grammarly. [CLS] [SEP] grammarly may freely assign this agreement,
including, without limitation, in connection with a merger, acquisition,
bankruptcy, reorganization, or sale of some or all of our assets or stock. [CLS] [SEP]

if any one or more of the provisions of this agreement are for any reason held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remaining provisions of this agreement shall be unimpaired and shall
remain in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision(s) shall be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision or
provisions that comes closest to the intent of the parties underlying the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s). [CLS] [SEP]

the failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. [CLS] [SEP] a waiver
by either party of any term or condition of this agreement or any breach
thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any
subsequent breach thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

if grammarly is unable to perform any obligation under this agreement because
of any matter beyond its reasonable control, such as lightning, flood,
exceptionally severe weather, fire, explosion, war, civil disorder, industrial
disputes (whether or not involving employees of grammarly), acts of local or
central government or other competent authorities, problems with
telecommunications providers, hostile network attacks or other events beyond
grammarly’s reasonable control (each, a “force majeure event”), grammarly will
have no liability to you for such failure to perform; provided, however, that
grammarly shall resume performance promptly upon removal of the circumstances
constituting the force majeure event. [CLS] [SEP] if any force majeure event continues for
more than sixty (60) days, either grammarly or you may terminate this
agreement by delivery of written notice to the other party. [CLS] [SEP] you will remain
responsible for all fees incurred through the last day the services were
available. [CLS] [SEP]

this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between grammarly and you with
respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior communications and
proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between grammarly and you. [CLS] [SEP] no
waiver or modification of any of the provisions of this agreement shall be
binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
each party. [CLS] [SEP]
