# what services does standard notes use for daily operation?

for our cloud servers and databases, we use [amazon web
services](https://aws.amazon.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

for credit card payment processing, we use [stripe](https://stripe.com/). [CLS] [SEP] for
paypal payments, we use
[braintree/paypal](https://www.braintreepayments.com/). [CLS] [SEP] for anonymous
cryptocurrency payments, we use [coinpayments](https://www.coinpayments.net). [CLS] [SEP]

for transactional emails and campaigns, we use amazon [simple email
service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). [CLS] [SEP] we [do not use
mailchimp](https://listed.to/@sn/1764/bye-bye-mailchimp) or a similar service. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not use analytics across our web, desktop, and mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP] for
our website, we use a self-hosted, privacy-respecting analytics software
called [matomo](https://matomo.org/). [CLS] [SEP]

for error reporting on our web, desktop, and mobile applications, we use
[bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com). [CLS] [SEP] bugsnag is non-invasive, and collects only what
it needs (see [this
article](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/#sending-diagnostic-
data) for web and desktop, and [this
article](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/react-
native/automatically-captured-data/) for mobile) to produce helpful error
reports that help us maintain application stability. [CLS] [SEP]

for server-side error reporting and monitoring, we use
[datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com). [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect or store ip addresses
as part of our datadog configuration. [CLS] [SEP]

for our [open-source repositories](https://github.com/standardnotes), we use
[github](https://github.com). [CLS] [SEP] we also use github as our cdn for desktop
application downloads. [CLS] [SEP]

for windows application code signing, we use a [digicert extended validation
certificate](https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing/). [CLS] [SEP] for
[macos code signing](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/), we
use a verified apple developer account. [CLS] [SEP] code signing ensures that the
application you download and run has not been modified or tampered with, and
does not deviate from the code we produce and ship on our end. [CLS] [SEP]

for general email inquiries to
[help@standardnotes.org](mailto:help@standardnotes.org), we use google
workspace. [CLS] [SEP] for encrypted support to
[standardnotes@protonmail.com](mailto:standardnotes@protonmail.com), we use
[protonmail](https://protonmail.com). [CLS] [SEP] apart from optional google drive
integration, this marks the only integration point we have with google. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not use google analytics anywhere in our ecosystem, nor do we use google's [
recaptcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recaptcha) for spam control. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

this summarizes the list of external services we use in our daily operation. [CLS] [SEP]

when it comes to protecting your sensitive, actual data, we're proud to rely
on no other entity than the laws of mathematics and cryptography. [CLS] [SEP] your notes
are always [encrypted with a secure key](https://standardnotes.org/help/3/how-
does-standard-notes-secure-my-notes) that no one has besides you, and this key
never leaves your computer or touches a cloud. [CLS] [SEP] simply put: you are the only
person that can [read your private
notes](https://standardnotes.org/help/1/who-can-read-my-private-notes). [CLS] [SEP]
