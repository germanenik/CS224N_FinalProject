## commercial e-mail:

this company will never send an unsolicited e-mail message. [CLS] [SEP] we maintain a very
serious position on this matter. [CLS] [SEP] also, we do not allow the distribution of
unsolicited commercial e-mail (sometimes called junk e-mail or spam) by third
parties to its members. [CLS] [SEP] if there are attempts to send unsolicited e-mail to
anyone in this domain from other accounts in this domain or from over the
internet, it is our policy to take appropriate action to see that such
solicitations are not sent though this system again. [CLS] [SEP]

it is a violation of our terms of service to send unsolicited advertising and
promotional material through our system, or to give a return address of this
domain or system. [CLS] [SEP]

it is the policy of this company to charge a flat rate fee for message storage
& transmission for any unsolicited commercial mailings of $100.00 per message
received. [CLS] [SEP] bills left unpaid after 30 days will be forwarded to applicable
service providers and assessed a 50% late fee. [CLS] [SEP] after 60 days, unpaid bills
will be referred to applicable credit reporting and collection agencies. [CLS] [SEP] a
second unsolicited commercial e-mail through this domain will also result in
action under the terms of applicable u.s. [CLS] [SEP] law, including title 47,
sec.227(b)(1)(c) of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] code, as follows: "it shall be unlawful for any
person within the united states to use any telephone facsimile machine,
computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone
facsimile machine." a "telephone facsimile machine" is defined in
sec.227(a)(2)(b) as: "equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or
images (or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular telephone
line onto paper." under this definition, an e-mail account, modem, computer
and printer together constitute a fax machine. [CLS] [SEP]

our company specifically does not authorize the use of its proprietary
computers, servers, routers and computer network (the "network") to accept,
transmit or distribute unsolicited bulk e-mail sent from the internet to our
members. [CLS] [SEP] it is also a violation of policy, and the law, to send or cause to be
sent to, or through, the network internet email that makes use of or contains
invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain names or other means
of deceptive addressing. [CLS] [SEP] we consider such email to be counterfeit, and any
attempt to send or cause such counterfeit email to be sent to, or through, our
network is unauthorized. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, any email relayed from a third party's mail
servers without the permission of that third party, or any email that hides or
obscures, or attempts to hide or obscure, the source of an email also
constitutes an unauthorized use of our network. [CLS] [SEP] email sent or caused to be
sent to our network that violates our terms of service is also unauthorized. [CLS] [SEP]
nor do we authorize the harvesting or collection of screen or account names
from the our network for the purpose of sending unsolicited email. [CLS] [SEP]

our customers may send a single e-mail message to a maximum of 100 recipients
in one mailing, not to exceed 500 recipients within a one hour period. [CLS] [SEP] all
single e-mails sent to over 100 addressees will not be delivered. [CLS] [SEP] no notice
will be given to you in this case. [CLS] [SEP] if you send e-mails to more than 500
recipients within a one hour period, your ability to send any e-mail messages
is suspended. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to take all legal and technical steps
available to prevent unsolicited bulk email or other unauthorized email from
entering, utilizing or remaining within our network. [CLS] [SEP] such action may include,
without limitation, the use of filters or other network devices, immediate
termination of service, and prosecution of offenders through criminal or civil
proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this policy shall be construed to grant any right to
transmit or send email to, or through, our network, and in no event shall any
failure by us to enforce this policy constitute a waiver of our rights. [CLS] [SEP]

unauthorized use of our network in connection with the transmission of
unsolicited bulk email, including the transmission of counterfeit email, may
result in civil and criminal penalties against the sender, including those
provided by the computer fraud and abuse act (18 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] Â§ 1030 et seq.); and
various state laws, including the virginia computer crimes act (va. [CLS] [SEP] code ann. [CLS] [SEP]
Â§ 18.2-152.2 et seq.) (amended effective july 1, 1999.)

virtbiz, in its sole discretion, may terminate service without warning for any
customer who is found to send unsolicited commercial email. [CLS] [SEP] in no case shall
we be held liable for any loss of income, business interruption, or other
damages that may be caused by such termination of service and remain protected
by our published terms of service (tos), acceptable use policy (aup) in
addition to the united states of america "can spam act of 2003" which states
in part (b) "isp held harmless for good faith private enforcement- an isp is
not liable, under any federal or state civil or criminal law, for any action
it takes in good faith to block the transmission or receipt of unsolicited
commercial e-mail."

## data integrity/backups:

**shared hosting** : our shared hosting servers are backed up on a nightly
basis in order to provide continuity for disaster recovery purposes. [CLS] [SEP] as these
backups are automated and overwrite previous backups, we cannot guarantee the
backup will contain the exact desired content (website files, emails, database
records) for every customer. [CLS] [SEP] to this end, virtbiz offers backup provisions
through the hosting control panel (ie: cpanel, blueonyx, plesk) that customers
are encouraged to take advantage of. [CLS] [SEP] backups can be stored on the hosting
server itself as well as downloaded for local storage (ie: a "safety copy"). [CLS] [SEP]

**dedicated hosting** : virtbiz does not provide any sort of backup solution
by default for dedicated or vps servers. [CLS] [SEP] it is expected that the customer has
a working competency with regard to data integrity and it is the customer
responsibility to maintain a backup strategy. [CLS] [SEP] virtbiz may be able to offer
support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site. [CLS] [SEP] dedicated hosting
customers can contact their account representative for assistance and
consultation. [CLS] [SEP]

**colocation** : due to the nature of varied colocation use cases, no backup
solution is provided for colocation users. [CLS] [SEP] it is expected that the customer
has a working competency with regard to data integrity and it is the customer
responsibility to maintain a backup strategy. [CLS] [SEP] irtbiz may be able to offer
support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site. [CLS] [SEP] colocation hosting
customers can contact their account representative for assistance and
consultation. [CLS] [SEP]

## indemnification:

upon our request, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless our
company and its subsidiary and other affiliated companies, and their
employees, contractors, officers, and directors from all liabilities, claims,
and expenses, including attorney's fees, that arise from your use or misuse of
this site. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive
defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you,
in which event you will cooperate in asserting any available defenses. [CLS] [SEP] in the
event that any suit or claim is brought against us that is contrary to any
portion of this tos or our aup document, such action shall be considered
frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] we shall immediately seek dismissal with reimbursement of all court
costs and legal fees in addition to punitive damages. [CLS] [SEP] in no event shall
virtbiz be liable for incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages,
including, without limitation, lost business profits. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, virtbiz
shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] service is provided on an "as is, as
available" basis. [CLS] [SEP] no warranties, expressed or implied, including but not
limited to those of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, are
made with respect to virtbiz or any information or software therein. [CLS] [SEP] except as
may be otherwise specifically provided, this expressly includes any
reimbursement for losses of income due to disruption of service by virtbiz or
its providers. [CLS] [SEP]

## restriction of access:

a user may be restricted or barred from our system at any time. [CLS] [SEP] causes for
access restriction include, but are not limited to: non-payment, failure to
adhere to the tos, non-compliance with relevant laws, and transmission of
material we deem inappropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

disputes will be handled on an individual basis and only in writing. [CLS] [SEP] we will
send written notice via us postal service with our final decision. [CLS] [SEP] send your

internet resource access request

dallas tx 75226

## unauthorized access:

access to system resources beyond what has been made available through this
website is strictly forbidden. [CLS] [SEP]

attempts to access or "hack" into restricted areas of our system will be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of state and federal laws, and extradition
will be fully enforced when applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

should you have any questions about the terms of service, send an e-mail to
support@virtbiz.com. [CLS] [SEP] it may be helpful to include the subject "terms of
service" in your message. [CLS] [SEP]

## consequences of violation:

violation of this policy by a customer may result in temporary suspension or
permanent termination of service, at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] we do not issue
service credits for any outages incurred through service disablement resulting
from policy violations. [CLS] [SEP]

## inclusion of service agreement:

agreement](https://www.virtbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/network-service-

since lumen is a major carrier providing services to isps, if your isp uses
