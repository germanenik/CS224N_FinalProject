## information we collect from you

  * **information you give us**. [CLS] [SEP] this is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on a canonical website or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] it includes information you provide when you register to use our site, your login information where provided on a site or make a purchase on our site. [CLS] [SEP] it may include the following: first name, last name; company name; company size; industry; job title; level; phone number; email address; state or province and country. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP]
  * **information we receive from other sources**. [CLS] [SEP] this is information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. [CLS] [SEP] in this case we will have informed you when we collected that data (through a privacy notice) if we intend to share those data internally and combine it with data collected on this site. [CLS] [SEP] we will also have told you for what purpose we will share and combine your data. [CLS] [SEP] we are working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies). [CLS] [SEP] we may notify you when we receive information about you from them and the purposes for which we intend to use that information. [CLS] [SEP]

## how information is collected from you

we may collect this information through the following routes:

### websites

when you register to use certain parts of our websites, such as wikis,
webinars or message boards, or register for free accounts, we may ask for
personal information such as your full name, email address and a password. [CLS] [SEP]
please see the privacy notice on collection for further details of how we will
use your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

### chat rooms, forums and newsgroups

these are available to our community. [CLS] [SEP] any information that you disclose in
these areas becomes public information and may be recorded, archived and
republished by anyone. [CLS] [SEP] please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any
personal information in such areas. [CLS] [SEP]

### canonical products

when you register for services or purchase any product from canonical, we may
ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit
card information. [CLS] [SEP] credit card information is only used in processing your
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] please note that we may use a third party payment processing
merchant to process your payments. [CLS] [SEP] please see the terms and conditions of
purchase and/or relevant privacy notice for further information. [CLS] [SEP]

### webinars

some webinars are directly hosted by canonical on our sites. [CLS] [SEP] where a webinar
is operated by a third-party provider, you will be directed to a third-party
website and the third-party provider may collect information as part of the
webinar registration process. [CLS] [SEP] this data will be collected in accordance with
the third-party provider's terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] please see "links and third-
party content" in the terms and conditions for further details. [CLS] [SEP]

### non-personally identifying information

canonical may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. [CLS] [SEP] our purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
visitors use our websites and services. [CLS] [SEP] for further information about how we
use cookies, see the "cookie" section below. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that canonical may also collect system information during
installation of ubuntu and on first login to ubuntu. [CLS] [SEP] this system information
is subject to a [legal notice](/legal/online-account-terms). [CLS] [SEP]

### error reports

when you chose to send an error report, it includes a unique identifier for
your computer. [CLS] [SEP] this identifier does not identify you, unless you (or someone
acting on your behalf) discloses it separately. [CLS] [SEP] an error report may include
personal information such as the state of programs that were running at the
time. [CLS] [SEP] you can block future error reports from the privacy panel of system
settings or by deselecting the "enable google analytics in maas ui to shape
improvements in user experience" box where applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

### ubuntu online accounts

when you use ubuntu online accounts, your personal information is stored on
your pc and it can be accessed by some applications. [CLS] [SEP] further information can
be found in a [legal notice](/legal/online-account-terms). [CLS] [SEP]

### contacting us

if you contact us and provide us with information, we may keep a record of
that correspondence and information. [CLS] [SEP]

## what do we do with your personal data

we may use your information in the following ways:

  * to authenticate access to certain features of our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to contact you to respond to enquiries or to provide notices to you regarding your use of our websites or the provision of our services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to provide services, products, process payment, and authenticate access (where required). [CLS] [SEP]
  * to analyse the performance or the appropriateness of products or services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to comply with legal and regulatory requirements (including responding to court orders, subpoenas and to prevent crime). [CLS] [SEP] these special circumstances may require us to disclose personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to contact you if your actions violate your agreement with us (if any). [CLS] [SEP]
  * to fix errors and analyse trends. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to study how anonymous users interact with our websites and services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to market our products or services to you. [CLS] [SEP]

unless you have notified us otherwise, canonical may occasionally send you
email to tell you about new features, solicit feedback, or just to keep you up
to date with what's going on. [CLS] [SEP] we may use various community websites (launchpad
answers, ubuntu forums, blogs etc.) to communicate this type of information,
so we expect to keep this type of information to a minimum. [CLS] [SEP] if you no longer
wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in any of the communications, modify the communications
preferences in your account or contact us using the contact details provided
below. [CLS] [SEP]

## what are your rights?

you have the right to consent to our processing of personal data for marketing
purposes and to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we
intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your
information to any third party for such purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you can exercise your right
to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to
collect your data. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at
[dataprotection@canonical.com](mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com) or by

  * rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. [CLS] [SEP]

each of these rights are supported by appropriate procedures within canonical
which allow the required action to be taken within the timescales stated in
the applicable data protection legislation. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also ask us to stop using your information – the simplest way to do
this is to withdraw your consent, which you can do at any time, either by
clicking the unsubscribe link at the end of any newsletter, or by emailing,
writing or telephoning us using the contact details above. [CLS] [SEP]

we keep your order information for so long as reasonably required in
accordance with our record retention policy. [CLS] [SEP] your personal information
associated with the order will then be removed. [CLS] [SEP]

our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our
partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] if you follow a link to any of
these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy
policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these
policies. [CLS] [SEP] please check these policies before you submit any personal data to
these websites. [CLS] [SEP]

  * to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about goods or services that may interest you or them. [CLS] [SEP]
