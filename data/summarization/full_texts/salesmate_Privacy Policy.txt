team, send us an email, post on our blog, integrate the services with another

 **(b) information that we collect automatically:** when you use the services
or browse one of our websites, as a user or a visitor, we may collect
information about your visit to our websites, your usage of the services, and
your web browsing. [CLS] [SEP] that information may include your ip address, your

information about how you interacted with our websites or emails. [CLS] [SEP] we may
automatically collect this information as a part of log files as well as
through the use of cookies, ’’clear gifs,’’ ’’web beacons,’’ or other tracking
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed
more below, and in more detail in our cookie policy here. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies at the individual browser level. [CLS] [SEP] we partner with third parties to
manage and serve our advertising on other sites. [CLS] [SEP] our third party partners may

 **(f) web beacons:** we use web beacons on our websites and in our emails. [CLS] [SEP]
when we send emails to visitors or users, we may track behavior such as who
opened the emails and who clicked the links. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to measure the
performance of our email marketing initiatives and to improve our features for
specific segments of visits or users. [CLS] [SEP] to do this, we include single pixel
gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons allow us to

including personal data, from external sources or third party other than the

collected through the service. [CLS] [SEP]  
examples of the information we may receive from other sources include:
demographic information, device information (such as ip addresses, os

you may turn them off through your operating system. [CLS] [SEP] we may ask for, access or
track any location-based information from your mobile device only if you want

nature of the personal information. [CLS] [SEP] all personal information we received from

salesmate accounts require a username and password to log in. [CLS] [SEP] you must keep

action are performed or authorized only by the applicable customer or user. [CLS] [SEP]

controls the manner such personal information is collected and used as well as
the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such personal
information. [CLS] [SEP]
