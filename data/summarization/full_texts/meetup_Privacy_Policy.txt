if you are in a jurisdiction that requires a specific legal basis for
processing personal data, our legal basis for collecting and using the
information described above will depend on the type of information and the
specific context in which we collect it. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] we process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with our [terms of service](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360027447252), for example, to allow you to join groups or to display your profile to other members; to allow us to send you important service updates; and to perform a contract. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] we also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do so and not overridden by your rights (for example, in some cases for direct marketing, fraud prevention, network and information systems security, responding to your communications, the operation of networks of groups by the network administrators, and improving our platform). [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes you provide us with sensitive information about you; for instance, the mere fact of joining a certain group may indicate information about your health, religion, political views, or sexual identity. [CLS] [SEP] joining such groups or posting information on the platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on the settings of the group and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal basis for processing any sensitive information is either that you manifestly make it public or your explicit consent. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you, or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] sharing of information

summary: we may disclose personal information about you, including:

  * to members or social media services, depending on how you engage with the platform. [CLS] [SEP] information that is public on our platform is accessible to others both on and off the platform;

  * to an affiliate or successor entity as part of a corporate transaction
  * among our businesses and affiliated companies; and
  * when you direct us to share your information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share information in a manner that does not identify you, such as
de-identified or aggregated information. [CLS] [SEP] such information is not subject to
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not sell or share information about you except as described in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

3.1 through our platform

we share some of the information that we collect by displaying it on our
platform according to your member profile and account settings. [CLS] [SEP] some
information, such as username, is always public. [CLS] [SEP] some information, such as
interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] some
information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other
members of that meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of
that group. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you check the group settings and what
information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are
happy with the information that is visible to others. [CLS] [SEP] for more information,
see this article on [account privacy and
visibility](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360001655712-account-
privacy-and-message-settings) and this article on [group content
visibility](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360002921751-meetup-group-
content-visibility-settings). [CLS] [SEP]

information that is public on our platform is visible to others on and off the
platform. [CLS] [SEP]

3.2 group networks

if you are a member of a group, this group may now or in the future become
part of a network of groups known as a “meetup pro” network. [CLS] [SEP] members who
administer a meetup pro network, known as “network administrators” have access
to the content within their groups, including information about group
participants. [CLS] [SEP] network administrators find it helpful to have access to the
email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their
networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, we
will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group’s
network administrator. [CLS] [SEP] see this article for more information about [network
administrators, organizers, and their
members](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360002797432-meetup-pro-
network-administrators-organizers-and-their-members). [CLS] [SEP]

3.3 with our service providers

we may use service providers in connection with operating and improving the
platform to assist with certain business purposes, such as payment processing,
email transmission, conducting surveys or contests, data hosting, managing our
ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer support. [CLS] [SEP] these service
providers, which include data analytics providers, may access, process, and
store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize,
subject to confidentiality obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

3.4 following the law and protecting meetup

we may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government
entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we
believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law,
regulation, legal process, or audits. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose information about
you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our [terms of
service](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360027447252) or related
guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or
safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, meetup or others. [CLS] [SEP]

3.5 social sharing and other tools

the platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools
which let you share actions that you take on our platform with third-party
services, and vice versa. [CLS] [SEP] such features let you share information with your
friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the
service. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, see this article on [sharing meetup events on
social media](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360002882691-how-do-i-
share-a-meetup-on-facebook-or-twitter-) and this article on [connecting your
social media account](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360002878451-how-
do-i-link-my-facebook-account-). [CLS] [SEP] the third-party services' use of the
information will be governed by the third-parties’ privacy policies, and we do
not control the third parties’ use of the shared data. [CLS] [SEP] for more information
about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection
with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the
services that provide these features. [CLS] [SEP]

3.6 affiliate sharing and merger, sale, or other asset transfers

if meetup is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization,
bankruptcy, or sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold,
or transferred as part of that transaction. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share information
about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or
affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]

3.7 other situations

we may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so
that you can no longer be identified. [CLS] [SEP] such information is not subject to this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction
or where we are legally entitled to do so. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your information may
be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you when you rsvp to
an event. [CLS] [SEP] your information also is made available to other group members and
event organizers when you rsvp for and participate in an event. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] additional details

details about these technologies and the information that they collect, use,
or share, including how you may be able to control or disable these services. [CLS] [SEP]

4.2 transfer of information to the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and other countries

**meetup is based in the united states.** information about you will be
transferred to, and processed in, the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and countries other than the
country in which you are resident. [CLS] [SEP] these countries may have data protection
laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may
not be as protective. [CLS] [SEP] we have taken appropriate safeguards, such as standard
contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected in
accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

4.3 security

we employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your
information that is under our control and that we process on your behalf from
unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or
disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we
store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security
controls are used. [CLS] [SEP] we train employees regarding our data privacy policies and
procedures, and authorize employees to access personal information as required
for their role. [CLS] [SEP] we use firewalls designed to protect against intruders and
test for network vulnerabilities. [CLS] [SEP] however, no method of transmission over the
internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. [CLS] [SEP]

where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are
responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. [CLS] [SEP] if
you would like to update or change your password, you may select the “forgot
your password?” link on the login page. [CLS] [SEP] you will be sent an email that allows
you to reset your password. [CLS] [SEP]

4.4 data retention

we may temporarily de-activate your account if you have not logged in for six
months or more. [CLS] [SEP] you may contact us if you wish to reactivate your account. [CLS] [SEP]

we retain certain information that we collect from you while you visit or are
a member of the platform, and in certain cases where you have deleted your
account, for the following business purposes:

  * so you can use our platform;
  * so ensure that we do not communicate with you if you have asked us not to;
  * to provide you with a refund, if entitled;
  * to provide accurate accounting information to other members about the groups that they organize or administer, and associated memberships;
  * to better understand the traffic to our platform so that we can provide all members with the best possible experience;
  * to detect and prevent abuse of our platform, illegal activities and breaches of our terms of service; and
  * to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

we will either delete it or take steps to de-identify or anonymize it in
accordance with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

4.5 policy scope

this privacy policy does not apply to information that you have provided or
made accessible to third parties, such as other members, including group
organizers and network administrators, and others with whom you may share
information about yourself. [CLS] [SEP] our platform may direct you to a third-party
service, such as social media services, or a portion of our platform may be

members by selecting the unsubscribe link in the message that you receive, or
by adjusting the communication preferences in your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] we will

information about how to control or opt out of promotional messages from them
off the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

you can tag photos of yourself and others. [CLS] [SEP] when a photo has been tagged it
means that the name of that person will appear alongside the photo, and the
tagged photo will appear on the tagged member’s group profile. [CLS] [SEP]

we will notify you when another member has tagged your account in a photo or
when additional comments are added to such photos. [CLS] [SEP] you can remove tags by
selecting the “untag” option next to your name. [CLS] [SEP] you can also [report
inappropriate
content](https://meetup.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360001673551-report-spam-or-
