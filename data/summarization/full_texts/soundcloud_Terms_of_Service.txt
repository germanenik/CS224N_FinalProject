## description of the platform

the platform is a hosting service. [CLS] [SEP] registered users of the platform may
submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and
other content, data or information ( **"content"** ), which will be stored by
soundcloud at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and
distributed by such registered users, and other users of the platform, using
the tools and features provided as part of the platform and accessible via the
website, apps and elsewhere. [CLS] [SEP] the platform also enables registered users to
interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any
user of the website, apps or certain services (who may or may not be
registered users of the platform) to view, listen to and share content
uploaded and made available by registered users. [CLS] [SEP]

the platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users
to engage with and learn from the soundcloud community in order to build a
following and ensure you get the content that inerests you most. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
users who upload content to soundcloud will gain access to our creator stats
feature, which provides creators with insights into how the content they
upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and
downloaders of such content. [CLS] [SEP]

some features of our platform are only available to registered users who
subscribe to a certain service (see subscriptions and gift codes below). [CLS] [SEP]
soundcloud however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe to such
services. [CLS] [SEP] in order to make the platform available for free and provide you
with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the platform on
behalf of third party advertisers. [CLS] [SEP] to that end, we use information that you
make available to us when you interact with the platform to inform the nature
of the ads we show you and provide you with a customized experience. [CLS] [SEP] more
information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in
our [privacy policy](/pages/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

we may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the website,
release new versions of our apps, or introduce other services and/or features
for the platform. [CLS] [SEP] any new services and features will be subject to these terms
of use as well as any additional terms and conditions that we may release for
those specific services or features. [CLS] [SEP]

## your soundcloud account

you are not obliged to register to use the platform. [CLS] [SEP] however, access to the
apps and certain services is only available to registered users. [CLS] [SEP] as an
example, our app, soundcloud pulse, enables registered users, who upload and
make available their content to other users, to receive instant feedback on
the performance of their tracks, communicate with their listeners, and manage
their content anytime. [CLS] [SEP]

in order for you to enagage with other soundcloud listeners and creators, we
enable you to create and personalize a public profile on soundcloud. [CLS] [SEP] to enable
you to do that, you must provide us with the information you want to display
on such profile. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to help you to navigate and discover content on the platform that
interests you, as a registered user you will also receive auto-generated
personalized recommendations of other content that might appeal to you, based
on your listening habits. [CLS] [SEP]

when you register to use the platform, you will provide us with your email
address, and will choose a username and password for your account. [CLS] [SEP] you must
ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. [CLS] [SEP] your
email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself
will be treated in accordance with our [privacy policy](/pages/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of
your username and password, and you will remain responsible for all use of
your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,
whether or not such activity was authorized by you. [CLS] [SEP]

if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your
account has been accessed by unauthorized third parties, you are advised to
notify soundcloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest
possible opportunity. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames
and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole
discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your
account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion,
would or might constitute a violation of these terms of use or our [community
guidelines](/en/other/community-guidelines), or an infringement or violation
of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

you may terminate your account at any time as described in the termination

liability in the event that you are unable to access an item of content due to
its removal from the platform, whether by soundcloud or the relevant uploader. [CLS] [SEP]

the platform, including, without limitation, the website, the apps and all
content and services accessed through or via the website, the apps, the
services or otherwise, are provided "as is", "as available", and "with all
faults". [CLS] [SEP]

whilst soundcloud uses reasonable endeavors to correct any errors or omissions
in the platform as soon as practicable once they have been brought to
soundcloudâs attention, soundcloud makes no promises, guarantees,
representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever (express or implied)
regarding the website, the apps, the services or any part or parts thereof,
any content, or any linked services or other external services. [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud
does not warrant that your use of the platform will be uninterrupted, timely,
secure or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the platform or
any part or parts thereof, the content, or the servers on which the platform
operates are or will be free of viruses or other harmful components. [CLS] [SEP]
soundcloud does not warrant that any transmission of content uploaded to the
platform will be secure or that any elements of the platform designed to
prevent unauthorized access, sharing or download of content will be effective
in any and all cases, and does not warrant that your use of the platform is
lawful in any particular jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

soundcloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and
their respective employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders,
specifically disclaim all of the foregoing warranties and any other warranties
not expressly set out herein to the fullest extent permitted by law, including
without limitation any express or implied warranties regarding non-
infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

where the law of any jurisdiction limits or prohibits the disclaimer of
implied or other warranties as set out above, the above disclaimers shall not
apply to the extent that the law of such jurisdiction applies to this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

## limitation of liability

in no event shall soundcloudâs aggregate liability to you under this
agreement exceed the greater of 100 euro or the amounts (if any) paid by you
to soundcloud during the previous twelve (12) months for the services giving
rise to the claim. [CLS] [SEP]

soundcloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and
their respective employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders,
shall have no liability for:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] any loss or damage arising from:

(a) your inability to access or use the platform or any part or parts thereof,
or to access any content or any external services via the platform;

(b) any changes that soundcloud may make to the platform or any part thereof,
or any temporary or permanent suspension or cessation of access to the
platform or any content in or from any or all territories;

(c) any action taken against you by third party rightsholders with respect to
any alleged infringement of such third partyâs rights relating to your
content or your use of the platform, or any action taken as part of an
investigation by soundcloud or any relevant law enforcement authority
regarding your use of the platform;

(d) any errors or omissions in the platformâs technical operation, or from
any inaccuracy or defect in any content or any information relating to
content;

(e) your failure to provide soundcloud with accurate or complete information,
or your failure to keep your username or password suitably confidential;

(f) any misconduct by other users or third parties using the platform,
especially in breach of the agreement;

  2. [CLS] [SEP] any loss or damage to any computer hardware or software, any loss of data (including your content), or any loss or damage from any security breach; and/or

  3. [CLS] [SEP] any loss of profits, or any loss you suffer which is not a foreseeable consequence of soundcloud breaching these terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] losses are foreseeable where they could be contemplated by you and soundcloud at the time you agree to these terms of use, and therefore do not include any indirect losses, such as loss of opportunity. [CLS] [SEP]

any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the
platform must be notified to soundcloud as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions
may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, you acknowledge and agree that such
limitations and exclusions reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk
between you and soundcloud and are fundamental elements of the bargain between
you and soundcloud, and that soundcloudâs liability will be limited to the
maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

nothing in these terms of use limits or excludes the liability of soundcloud,
its subsidiaries, successors, assigns, or their respective employees, agents,
directors, officers and/or shareholders: (i) for any death or personal injury
caused by its or their negligence, (ii) for any form of fraud or deceit, (iii)
for any damages caused wilfully or by gross negligence, or (iv) for any form
of liability which cannot be limited or excluded by law. [CLS] [SEP]

## indemnification

you hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless soundcloud, its
successors, assigns, affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees and
shareholders from and against any and all claims, obligations, damages,
losses, expenses, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting
from:

(i) any violation by you of these terms of use or our [community
guidelines](/en/other/community-guidelines);

(ii) any third party claim of infringement of copyright or other intellectual
property rights or invasion of privacy arising from the hosting of your

platform or linked services in accordance with these terms of use and the
parameters set by you with respect to the distribution and sharing of your
content;

(iii) any activity related to your account, be it by you or by any other
person accessing your account with or without your consent unless such
activity was caused by the act or default of soundcloud. [CLS] [SEP]

## data protection, privacy and cookies

all personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the
platform is collected, stored, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by
soundcloud in accordance with our [privacy policy](/pages/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us
understand how people are using the platform, so that we can continue to
improve the service we offer. [CLS] [SEP] our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies,
is explained in our [cookies policy](/pages/cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

## meetups

soundcloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend
face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world ( **"meetups"** ). [CLS] [SEP] while
soundcloud is generally supportive of meetups and may provide branded
promotional materials to help organizers promote their meetups, soundcloud
does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such meetups. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby
acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any meetups is
entirely at your own risk and soundcloud does not bear any responsibility or
liability for the actions of any soundcloud users or any third parties who
organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any meetups. [CLS] [SEP]

## competitions and other promotions

from time to time, some soundcloudâ® users may promote competitions,
promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the platform (
**"third party competitions"** ). [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud is not the sponsor or promoter of
these third party competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or
liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize,
administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these third party
competitions. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to participate in any of these third party
competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions
applicable to the relevant third party competition and to ensure that you
understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able
to participate in such third party competitions in your country of residence. [CLS] [SEP]

if you wish to run your own third party competition on the platform, you are
free to do so provided you comply with our competition terms, which are
available [here](/pages/competition). [CLS] [SEP]

## use of soundcloud players and widget

the platform includes access to customizable players ( **"players"** ), and an
embeddable version of the soundcloud waveform player ( **"widget"** ) for
incorporation into usersâ own sites, third party sites or social media
profiles, whether or not a linked service. [CLS] [SEP] this functionality is provided to
enable uploaders to put their content wherever they wish, and to enable other
users of the platform to share and distribute content within the parameters
set by the uploader. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not, without the prior written consent of soundcloud, use the players
or the widget in such a way that you aggregate content from the platform into
a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the
website, or comprises a content service of which content from the platform
forms a material part. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, you may not, without the prior written
consent of soundcloud, use the players or the widget to embed content into any
website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where
the relevant content is your content and you are the person or are authorized
to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a
particular genre. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use the players or widget in any way that
suggests that soundcloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party
endorses or supports your website, or your use of the players or widget. [CLS] [SEP] the
foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial. [CLS] [SEP]

soundcloud reserves the right to block your use of the players and the widget
at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

## subscriptions and gift codes

certain features of the platform are only available to registered users who
subscribe to a "pro" or "pro unlimited" plan (together, **"pro accounts"** )
or to soundcloud go (pro accounts and soundcloud go are each referred to as a
**"subscrpition"** ). [CLS] [SEP]

the purchase of pro accounts and gift codes related to pro accounts is subject
to additional terms, which you will find [here](/terms-of-use-pro). [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, the purchase of subscriptions for soundcloud go is subject to
additional terms, which you will find [here](/go-terms-of-use). [CLS] [SEP]

the pro account terms and the soundcloud go terms include, amongst other
things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of
your subscription, including your right of cancellation during the first 14
days of your subscription, and certain technical usage limitations. [CLS] [SEP]

the pro account terms are applicable to pro and pro unlimited account users
and the soundcloud go terms are applicable to soundcloud go users in addition
to these general terms of use when they purchase a subscription. [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud
reserves the right to limit the availability of soundcloud go subscriptions to
specific jurisdictions as may be determined by soundcloud in its sole
discretion from time to time. [CLS] [SEP]

## changes to the platform, accounts and pricing

soundcloud reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend,
discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the platform or any part
thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with
respect to individual territories only. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of any temporary or
permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access,
soundcloud shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of
such decision in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

you hereby agree that soundcloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors,
assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be
liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the
website, apps and/or any services that soundcloud may wish to make from time
to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the website,
the services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or
access the same from or within any territory or territories. [CLS] [SEP]

soundcloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or
introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any
reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its subscriptions from
time to time. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any increase in the price or material reduction
in the features of any subscription which you have purchased, such change(s)
will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any
subsequent renewal of your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] in all other cases, where soundcloud
proposes to make changes to any type of subscription you have purchased, and
these changes are material and to your disadvantage, soundcloud will notify
you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your soundcloudâ® account
and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your
account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. [CLS] [SEP] you will have no obligation to
continue using the platform following any such notification, but if you do not
terminate your account as described in the termination section below during
such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of
that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to
your subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

unexpired period of your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] if your account is terminated pursuant

irretrievably deleted by soundcloud, except to the extent that we are obliged
or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period
of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect
