# brave rewards advertiser privacy policy

read this document to learn how we use data about advertisers. [CLS] [SEP] in this policy
âweâ, âusâ, etc. [CLS] [SEP] refers to brave software inc. [CLS] [SEP]

(to learn how we use data to operate this website and other brave sites,
forums, and communications, see the [website privacy
policy](/privacy/website/). [CLS] [SEP] to learn how we use data for the brave browser,
see the [brave browser privacy policy](/privacy/browser/)). [CLS] [SEP]

## advertiser privacy __

when you establish an advertiser account with us, we will ask you for the
information we need to validate your identity and to bill you for advertising
services. [CLS] [SEP] this always includes:

  * your name, email address, and phone number;
  * your businessâs name and mailing address;
  * the domain name(s) to which your ads will direct people who see them; and
  * billing information needed to process payment. [CLS] [SEP]

other information may be required by your advertising account representative
in order to process and fulfill your orders. [CLS] [SEP] the only information we collect
from you is the information you provide us in these communications with your
account representative. [CLS] [SEP]

we need this information in order to operate the advertising services youâre
purchasing from us according to the [brave rewards: terms of service for
advertisers contract](https://basicattentiontoken.org/advertiser-terms-of-
service). [CLS] [SEP] this same information is required in order for us to maintain
accurate records and accounts of the services we have provided, in which we
have a legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP]

we keep all this info as long as you have an advertiser account with us, and
for seven years afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] beyond seven years, we no longer store your
personal information, only information about your company. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your account information as follows:

  * with vendors, consultants and other service providers who act as data processors on behalf of brave;
  * in response to a request for information if we believe the disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process; or
  * otherwise, with your consent or at your direction. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share information which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use sendgrid or mailchimp based in the united states to contact you by
email. [CLS] [SEP] the processing of personal data on our behalf is subject to a range of
measures to help safeguard your personal data including the use of eu standard
contractual clauses. [CLS] [SEP] every email we send this way will also include an
unsubscribe link. [CLS] [SEP]

## contacting brave about your privacy __

we are always interested in hearing and responding to questions and concerns
at [twitter.com/brave](https://twitter.com/brave) and at
[github.com/brave](https://github.com/brave). [CLS] [SEP] more in-depth conversations can
be had at [community.brave.com](https://community.brave.com). [CLS] [SEP]

we are represented in europe by brave software europe ltd (based in the uk). [CLS] [SEP]
you can contact our data protection officer and the rest of our privacy team
at [privacy@brave.com](mailto:privacy@brave.com). [CLS] [SEP] however, from the 1st
january 2021, given the ukâs exit from the eu, brave has appointed an eu
nominated representative and which you may contact if you would prefer not to
contact brave directly:

brave eu nominated representative  
care of castlebridge  
unit 7, 12 mountjoy square,  
dublin 1  
ireland

[brave@gdprnomrep.eu](mailto:brave@gdprnomrep.eu)

you can ask to know what information we have about you, update incorrect
information, delete it, object to our use of it, or get a copy of it. [CLS] [SEP] if
youâre in the european union, you also have the right to complain to your
[local data protection authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-
edpb/board/members_en) (though everyone should have this right). [CLS] [SEP]

weâll update this policy whenever we make material changes to our practices,
and weâll announce it to let you know. [CLS] [SEP]
