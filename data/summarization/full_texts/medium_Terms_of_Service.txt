you’re agreeing to be bound by these terms and our rules. [CLS] [SEP] please see our
[privacy policy](/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9) for information about
how we collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have any questions about these terms or our services, please contact us
at [legal@medium.com](mailto:legal@medium.com). [CLS] [SEP]

# your account and responsibilities

you’re responsible for your use of the services and any content you provide,
including compliance with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] content on the services may be
protected by others’ intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP] please don’t copy, upload,
download, or share content unless you have the right to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

your use of the services must comply with our rules. [CLS] [SEP]

you may need to register for an account to access some or all of our services. [CLS] [SEP]
help us keep your account protected. [CLS] [SEP] safeguard your password to the account,
and keep your account information current. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you do not share
your password with others. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re accepting these terms and using the services on behalf of someone
else (such as another person or entity), you represent that you’re authorized
to do so, and in that case the words “you” or “your” in these terms include
that other person or entity. [CLS] [SEP]

to use our services, you must be at least 13 years old. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use the services to access, collect, or use personal information about
other medium users (“personal information”), you agree to do so in compliance
with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree not to sell any personal information,
where the term “sell” has the meaning given to it under applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

for personal information you provide to us (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] as a newsletter editor), you
represent and warrant that you have lawfully collected the personal
information and that you or a third party has provided all required notices
and collected all required consents before collecting the personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] you further represent and warrant that medium’s use of such
personal information in accordance with the purposes for which you provided us
the personal information will not violate, misappropriate or infringe any
rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights)
and will not cause us to violate any applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

# user content on the services

medium may review your conduct and content for compliance with these terms and
our rules, and reserves the right to remove any violating content. [CLS] [SEP]

medium reserves the right to delete or disable content alleged to be
infringing the intellectual property rights of others, and to terminate
accounts of repeat infringers. [CLS] [SEP] we respond to notices of alleged copyright
infringement if they comply with the law; please report such notices using our
[copyright policy](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-
us/articles/214120487-copyright-dmca-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

# rights and ownership

you retain your rights to any content you submit, post or display on or
through the services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
unless otherwise agreed in writing, by submitting, posting, or displaying
content on or through the services, you grant medium a nonexclusive, royalty-
free, worldwide, fully paid, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce,
modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,
publicly perform and display your content and any name, username or likeness
provided in connection with your content in all media formats and distribution
methods now known or later developed on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

medium needs this license because you own your content and medium therefore
can’t display it across its various surfaces (i.e., mobile, web) without your
permission. [CLS] [SEP]

this type of license also is needed to distribute your content across our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you post a story on medium. [CLS] [SEP] it is reproduced as
versions on both our website and app, and distributed to multiple places
within medium, such as the homepage or reading lists. [CLS] [SEP] a modification might be
that we show a snippet of your work (and not the full post) in a preview, with
attribution to you. [CLS] [SEP] a derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes
on medium that uses portions of your content, again with full attribution. [CLS] [SEP]
this license applies to our services only, and does not grant us any
permissions outside of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

so long as you comply with these terms, medium gives you a limited, personal,
non-exclusive, and non-assignable license to access and use our services. [CLS] [SEP]

the services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other us and foreign
laws. [CLS] [SEP] these terms don’t grant you any right, title or interest in the
services, other users’ content on the services, or medium trademarks, logos or
other brand features. [CLS] [SEP]

separate and apart from the content you submit, post or display on our
services, we welcome feedback, including any comments, ideas and suggestions
you have about our services. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this feedback for any purpose, in our
sole discretion, without any obligation to you. [CLS] [SEP] we may treat feedback as
nonconfidential. [CLS] [SEP]

we may stop providing the services or any of its features within our sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] we also retain the right to create limits on use and storage and
may remove or limit content distribution on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

# termination

you’re free to stop using our services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to
suspend or terminate your access to the services with or without notice. [CLS] [SEP]

# transfer and processing data

in order for us to provide our services, you agree that we may process,
transfer and store information about you in the us and other countries, where
you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law. [CLS] [SEP]

# indemnification

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless medium, and our officers, directors, agents, partners and
employees (individually and collectively, the _“medium parties”_ ) from and
against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (
_“claims”_ ) arising out of or related to your violation, misappropriation or
infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights
or privacy rights) or your violation of the law. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to promptly notify
medium parties of any third-party claims, cooperate with medium parties in
defending such claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with
defending such claims (including attorneys’ fees). [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that the
medium parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at medium’s
sole option, of any third-party claims. [CLS] [SEP]

# disclaimers — service is “as is”

 **medium aims to give you great services but there are some things we can’t
guarantee. [CLS] [SEP] your use of our services is at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that
our services and any content posted or shared by users on the services are
provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either
express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, medium
doesn’t represent or warrant that our services are accurate, complete,
reliable, current or error-free. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or information obtained from medium
or through the services will create any warranty or representation not
expressly made in this paragraph. [CLS] [SEP] medium may provide information about third-
party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties
to make their content and information available on or through our services
(collectively, “ _third-party content_ ”). [CLS] [SEP] we do not control or endorse, and
we make no representations or warranties regarding, any third-party content. [CLS] [SEP]
you access and use third-party content at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] some locations don’t
allow the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you.**

# limitation of liability

 **we don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to
do so; this includes any liability for the gross negligence, fraud or
intentional misconduct of medium or the other medium parties in providing the
services. [CLS] [SEP] in countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed,
we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably
foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our
breach of our contract with you. [CLS] [SEP] this paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights
that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.**

 **in countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed,
medium and medium parties won’t be liable for:**

 **(a)** **any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or
special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory,
even if medium or the other medium parties have been advised of the
possibility of such damages.**

 **(b)** **other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as
described in this section), we limit the total liability of medium and the
other medium parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these terms
or our services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of
$50.00 usd or the amount paid by you to use our services.**

# resolving disputes; binding arbitration

we want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. [CLS] [SEP] before
filing a claim against medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve
the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at
legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to a medium corporation, p.o. [CLS] [SEP]
box 602, san francisco, ca 94104. [CLS] [SEP] the notice must (a) include your name,
residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the
nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. [CLS] [SEP]
our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your
online account and will contain the information described above. [CLS] [SEP] if we can’t
resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party
may initiate a formal proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

 **please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
arbitrate certain disputes and claims with medium and limits the manner in
which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by
following the instructions set forth below. [CLS] [SEP] no class or representative actions
or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.**

(a) **no representative actions. [CLS] [SEP] you and medium agree that any dispute arising
out of or related to these terms or our services is personal to you and medium
and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and
will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
representative proceeding.**

(b) **arbitration of disputes.** except for small claims disputes in which you
or medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in
the county where you reside or disputes in which you or medium seeks
injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or
misappropriation of intellectual property, **you and medium waive your rights
to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to
these terms or our services, including claims related to privacy and data
security, (collectively, “ _disputes_ ”) resolved in court**. [CLS] [SEP] all disputes
submitted to jams will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration
before one arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration proceedings will be held in san francisco,
california unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the
arbitration in your county of residence. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of this section a “ **
_consumer_** ” means a person using the services for personal, family or
household purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you and medium agree that disputes will be held in
accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules and procedures (“ **
_jams rules_** ”). [CLS] [SEP] the most recent version of the jams rules are available on
the[ jams website](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and
are incorporated into these terms by reference. [CLS] [SEP] you either acknowledge and
agree that you have read and understand the jams rules or waive your
opportunity to read the jams rules and waive any claim that the jams rules are
unfair or should not apply for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) you and medium agree that these terms affect interstate commerce and that
the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally
governed by the federal arbitration act, 9 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] § 1, _et seq_. [CLS] [SEP] (the “ **
_faa_** ”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] as limited by
the faa, these terms and the jams rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive
authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any
dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court,
including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than
one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative
proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) the arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged
information relevant to the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator, medium, and you will
maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and
awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of
the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will have
the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless
the law provides to the contrary. [CLS] [SEP] the duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to
the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the
arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for
a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an
arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is
otherwise required by law or judicial decision. [CLS] [SEP]

(e) you and medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay
the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and medium
will pay the remaining jams fees and costs. [CLS] [SEP] for any arbitration initiated by
medium, medium will pay all jams fees and costs. [CLS] [SEP] you and medium agree that the
state or federal courts of the state of california and the united states
sitting in san francisco, california have exclusive jurisdiction over any
appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. [CLS] [SEP]

(f) **any dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim
arose; otherwise, the dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and
medium will not have the right to assert the claim.**

(g) **you have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of
the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of
your request to**[ **yourfriends@medium.com**](mailto:yourfriends@medium.com). [CLS] [SEP]
in order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and
address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] by
opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in
accordance with the next section regarding “governing law and venue.”

(h) if any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful
for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed
from these terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision
shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the
parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an
individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any
claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or
representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of
competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that
litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any
individual claims in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] further, if any part of this section is
found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that
provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be
sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be
enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]

#  **governing law and venue**

these terms and any dispute that arises between you and medium will be
governed by california law except for its conflict of law principles. [CLS] [SEP] any
dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be
heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of
california and the united states, respectively, sitting in san francisco,
california. [CLS] [SEP]

some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local
laws of the consumer’s country. [CLS] [SEP] this paragraph doesn’t override those laws. [CLS] [SEP]

# amendments

we may make changes to these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we make changes,
we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address
associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating
the date at the top of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] unless we say otherwise in our notice, the
amended terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our
services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the
changes. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t agree to the amended terms, you must stop using our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

# severability

if any provision or part of a provision of these terms is unlawful, void or
unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable
from these terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
remaining provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

# miscellaneous

medium’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms
will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] these terms, and the
terms and policies listed in the other terms and policies that may apply to
you section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and
understandings of the parties. [CLS] [SEP] the section titles in these terms are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP] use of the word
“including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” except
as otherwise provided herein, these terms are intended solely for the benefit
of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights
upon any other person or entity. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that communications and
transactions between us may be conducted electronically. [CLS] [SEP]
