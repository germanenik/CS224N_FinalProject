cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels,
beacons, and local storage, including cookies) are comprised of small bits of
data. [CLS] [SEP] our websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser
when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or
other device so the website or app can access information when you make
subsequent requests for pages from that service. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies may also

commercially available sources, and information from our fox news affiliates
or business partners. [CLS] [SEP]

become effective when we post the revised privacy policy on the fox news
services. [CLS] [SEP]

**location of data.** the fox news services are hosted in and managed from the
united states. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a user located outside the united states, you
understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the
united states or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which
we engage service providers. [CLS] [SEP] united states and other countriesâ data
protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] in certain
circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or
security authorities in the united states may be entitled to access your
personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**linked services.** the fox news services may be linked to sites operated by
unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content,
functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications
developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. [CLS] [SEP] fox news is not
responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you
leave the fox news services or click an advertisement you should check the
applicable privacy policy of the other service. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, fox news is not

such as facebook, twitter, apple, google, microsoft or any other app

in connection with the fox news services. [CLS] [SEP]

**collection of personal financial information by a payment service.** in some
cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a
product or make payments ("payment service"). [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to purchase a
product or make a payment using a payment service, you will be directed to a
payment service webpage. [CLS] [SEP] any information that you provide to a payment service
will be subject to the applicable payment serviceâs privacy policy, rather

for, any payment serviceâs use of information collected through any payment
service.. [CLS] [SEP]

detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or
recordkeeping policies. [CLS] [SEP] it may not always be possible to completely remove or
delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual,
financial or legal requirements. [CLS] [SEP]
