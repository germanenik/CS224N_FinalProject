# etiquette policy

### introduction

deviantart is an expansive, worldwide community of artists of every age, and
every nationality who create works spanning every medium, every subject and
every level of talent and skill. [CLS] [SEP]

as the guiding force of this large and vibrant community we have two primary
and often conflicting goals in the service we provide for you, the members of
the community; the first being to ensure that members are free to express
themselves within reason with as few restrictions as possible while nurturing
an environment of creativity, learning, and talent and the second is to
protect the members of the community, to the best of our abilities, from
infringement of copyright, discrimination, harassment, and prejudice. [CLS] [SEP]

all members of the deviantart community are expected to be familiar with these
rules of etiquette and they will be enforced evenly and without bias in every
situation which is brought to the attention of the administration regardless
of the membership status of the user in question. [CLS] [SEP]

## guidelines for deviants;

### quality and placement

it is our policy to welcome artists of all levels from amateur to professional
and to that end we do not attach any minimum standards of quality to
deviations submitted by our membership; all manner of artworks are welcome
providing they meet with our etiquette and copyright policies. [CLS] [SEP] while we do not
impose quality standards we do ask that you practice self-moderation in what
you choose to submit and that you submit your works into the most appropriate
gallery. [CLS] [SEP] while we encourage the submission of only your very best works we
have provided an area for those submissions which may fall short of that 'top
quality' mark; this is your "scrapbook" gallery and we highly encourage its
use. [CLS] [SEP]

our community volunteers may elect to move one or more of your deviations from
the gallery categories into a different, more appropriate, section or into the
scrapbook category; we ask that you accept this decision gracefully and with a
mature attitude. [CLS] [SEP] if you desire a full explanation for this action, or if you
feel the administrative action was performed in error, you should submit an
inquiry to the official deviantart helpdesk and include a link to the relevant
deviation. [CLS] [SEP] please do not bring these issues into the forums, userpages, or
other areas of deviantart. [CLS] [SEP]

### prohibited commentary

_prohibited commentary is typically considered to be inherently disrespectful,
aggressive, or otherwise abusive._

we must insist that you refrain from comments which are racist, bigoted, or
which otherwise offensively target a philosophy or religion. [CLS] [SEP] in addition we
ask that our members avoid making offensive remarks based on gender or sexual
preference and that you do not make any remark, comment or critique which is
intended to be a direct insult to an individual, group, or genre of artwork. [CLS] [SEP]
hate propaganda is met with zero tolerance. [CLS] [SEP] comments which are overly
aggressive, personally insulting or needlessly abusive are also prohibited. [CLS] [SEP]

if you feel that you have been the target of harassment, personal insults or
other severe behavior please notify the staff by using the official deviantart
helpdesk. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that the staff will only directly intervene in cases
which are considered severe; minor situations may be dealt with using tools
made available to all registered members. [CLS] [SEP]

### discouraged commentary

_discouraged commentary is typically considered to have the potential to
escalate into an aggressive or abusive situation._

while not strictly prohibited we must insist that all personal arguments,
disagreements, and other volatile "personal" issues within be confined to
private communications such as notes, emails, or instant messaging programs. [CLS] [SEP]
likewise we discourage public accusations and other similar situations; please
bring all issues of this nature to the attention of the staff by notifying the
official deviantart helpdesk. [CLS] [SEP]

### exploitive commentary

_exploitive commentary is typically considered to be disruptive due to unusual
or unique factors._

do not 'spam' (send large numbers of identical notes or comments). [CLS] [SEP] spamming is
obnoxious and is typically used for self-promotion, or other unwanted
advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

do not 'flood' (place large numbers of comments rapidly on a single page or
craft a single comment which consumes a large amount of page space) the
forums, notes system, userpages or other areas of the site. [CLS] [SEP] flooding usually
disrupts page loading times and serves no useful purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

### respect your fellow artists

as a vibrant and growing art community deviantart welcomes all kinds of
original artworks; but we **must** insist that the artwork which you submit be
your own original works. [CLS] [SEP]

your deviations **must** be your own original creations and you may only use
resources which are considered legitimate and legal. [CLS] [SEP] submissions which make
use of works without proper permission or licensing by the original author
will be removed as they come to the attention of the staff. [CLS] [SEP] this policy
applies to all deviation submissions, scrapbook entries, and the preview
images used for written submissions. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have reason to believe that a deviantart submission violates this
policy you should use the official **report violation** link which is
available on every submission page. [CLS] [SEP]

### mature content

when we discuss _mature content_ we are specifically referring to deviations
which contain images, subject matter, or other themes which some viewers may
find offensive, distasteful, or otherwise undesirable to view or to read. [CLS] [SEP] the
most common 'undesired' viewing material may include, but is not limited to,
images containing artistic nudity (see details below), large amounts of
simulated blood and gore, or generally violent themes. [CLS] [SEP]

deviantart **strictly prohibits** the submission of materials classified as
pornographic or obscene. [CLS] [SEP] there is no exception to this prohibition. [CLS] [SEP]

certain content may be deemed _obscene_ by the administration and as such the
staff reserves the right to remove such content immediately upon discovery. [CLS] [SEP]
the administration reserves the sole right to review and classify questionable
material as obscene or not obscene. [CLS] [SEP]

### model release forms

the deviantart administrative staff reserves the right to demand a model
release form be provided for any photography (nude or otherwise) located
within either your gallery or scrapbook areas. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you receive
such a request an appropriate link will be included in the notification you
received. [CLS] [SEP] failure to properly respond to a model release form demand within
seven (7) days will result in the automatic removal of the associated
photograph. [CLS] [SEP]

for your own protection it is highly recommended that you have any model who
poses for you sign a release form giving you the explicit permission to
publish, share, distribute, and otherwise display the associated images. [CLS] [SEP] it is
highly recommended that you provide this form immediately after submitting
your photograph, especially if your subject is depicted nude. [CLS] [SEP] details of this
process may be found in the official deviantart faq. [CLS] [SEP]

### underage models

we **cannot** allow any nude works featuring individuals under the age of 18,
nor may the works depict these individuals in a 'sexually driven' manner such
as posing in lingerie or displaying a sexually suggestive or provocative pose. [CLS] [SEP]

this prohibition is for legal reasons; the laws in the united states are the
governing laws in regards to all submissions regardless of the deviant's
country of origin. [CLS] [SEP] photographs which are suspected of depicting a minor in
this manner will be temporarily suspended from public view and proper legal
documentation (as outlined above) will be demanded while photographs which
clearly depict a minor (including toddlers, preteens, and teenagers) in this
manner will be removed without notice. [CLS] [SEP]

submissions of a non- photographic nature which clearly depict a minor,
fictional character or otherwise, either nude or in a sexually driven manner
will be removed and deleted without notice as they come to the attention of
the staff. [CLS] [SEP]

### forum posting

in addition to the outlines in the above section entitled **_prohibited
commentary_** and **_exploitive commentary_** we have a few additional
policies regarding comments and posts within the forum areas of deviantart;

  * all threads started within a specific forum and all comments within those threads should be relevant to the forums title. [CLS] [SEP] this means that, for example, all threads within the **movies** forum must relate to a motion picture and the comments within those threads should also remain on the appropriate topic. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we encourage interactivity and we allow comments to be either positive or negative in nature providing that they remain constructive and promote a worthwhile dialogue. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we insist that forum threads adhere to the same standard set forth for deviation, scrapbook, and writing submissions in terms of what is considered acceptable subject matter (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] no racist threads, no sexual discussions, etc). [CLS] [SEP]

it is important to remember to be as clear in your intent as possible while
communicating on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] text communications do not afford a clear
representation of sarcasm. [CLS] [SEP] please use common sense when posting to avoid
confusion. [CLS] [SEP] threads which are misplaced, which contain inappropriate subject
matter (such as sexual discussions), or which contain an undesirable number of
insults or other violations of this etiquette policy will be locked and closed
to further commentary. [CLS] [SEP]

### avatars

this section applies only to avatars which you personally use for your
account; avatars submitted into a deviantart gallery or to your scrapbook must
still conform to all official policies without exception but are not subjected
to the restrictions below. [CLS] [SEP]

avatars used to represent your account on site are granted more leniency than
standard site submissions. [CLS] [SEP] you may freely use material and resources with only
the restrictions outlined as follows;

  * your avatar should not contain nudity of any sort. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * you may not use avatars specifically created by other users without their explicit permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your avatar contains a portion of a work made by another artist it will be removed by staff at the request of the original artist. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in all other respects your avatar must conform to the guidelines set above in regards to hate propaganda. [CLS] [SEP]

### exploits, vulnerabilities, and site abuse

the deviantart staff will not tolerate attempts to exploit or disrupt the
layout, navigability, or general use of the site. [CLS] [SEP] such actions disrupt the
ability of the community to access and review artwork and are considered site
abuse. [CLS] [SEP]

we will issue no warnings for violations of this nature. [CLS] [SEP] violators will be
banned immediately upon the discovery of the disruption or abuse. [CLS] [SEP]

deviantpoints may not be used to circumvent or interfere with the operations
of deviantart and cannot be used as payment for automated services affecting a
member's statistical or performance based metrics on deviantart. [CLS] [SEP]

### groups

all of the rules and guidelines of this etiquette policy apply to activities
within a group or in the management and administration of a group. [CLS] [SEP] all of the
policies with respect to content and commentary apply within groups and any
member or watcher of a group should feel comfortable reporting any activity to
which they object on the basis of this etiquette policy or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] we are
not responsible for the conduct of group participants or administrators. [CLS] [SEP]
however, the group applications permit us to take appropriate action should
intervention become necessary as a result of a violation of the terms of
service in general or of any other of our policies. [CLS] [SEP]

keep in mind that group administrators may determine their own rules and
privileges for deviants who participate in the group and as a general rule we
will not become involved in any disputes between group members, between group
administrators or between one or another group unless there is a clear
violation of our own policies, rules and terms. [CLS] [SEP] we suggest you use good
judgment and decency in all of your group interactions as well as exercising
the same cautions you would use in any internet exchanges with individuals who
you may not know. [CLS] [SEP] further helpful information about groups can be found in
[this faq](https://help.deviantart.com) and elsewhere on deviantart. [CLS] [SEP]

### changes in etiquette policy

as new situations come to our attention we may find it necessary to alter or
expand upon the policies stated here with little or no notification and any
such changes may be enforced in full against previously existing submissions
or behavior. [CLS] [SEP]

alterations of policy may be announced through either the deviantart status
forum or through other announcements and news topics. [CLS] [SEP]

### appeals and inquiries

appeals, inquiries, or questions concerning deviation removals, violation
notices, account suspensions, or other administrative actions should be
addressed to the official deviantart helpdesk where they will be forwarded to
the appropriate department for review. [CLS] [SEP]

please refrain from using the deviantart forums, the deviantart note system or
personal email to staff members for these concerns. [CLS] [SEP] you are unlikely to
receive a proper response and will be redirected to use the official helpdesk. [CLS] [SEP]

petitions and other forms of public outcry are discouraged and will have no
affect on managerial reviews of staff actions and may in fact be detrimental
to the case in question. [CLS] [SEP]
