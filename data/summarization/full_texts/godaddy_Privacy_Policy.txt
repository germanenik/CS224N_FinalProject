# godaddy - privacy policy

last revised: 2/23/2020

****to view our archived privacy policy,
click[here](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/archived-privacy-
policy).****

godaddy cares about your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] for this reason, we collect and use personal
information only as needed to deliver our products, services, websites and
mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you
have requested (collectively, our “services”). [CLS] [SEP] your personal information
includes information such as:

  * name
  * address
  * telephone number
  * date of birth
  * email address
  * billing and payment information
  * candidate information (for job applicants)
  * other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

our privacy policy not only explains how and why we use your personal
information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise
take control of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we’ve also created a [trust
center](https://www.godaddy.com/trust-center) that offers answers to your most
common questions, quick links to access your account settings, instructions on
how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions
to key terms and concepts noted in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights
described below, you may reach our data protection officer (“dpo”) and our
dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at
privacy@godaddy.com. [CLS] [SEP] this inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we
can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust. [CLS] [SEP]

****what information we collect, how we collect it, and why****

much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly
from you when you:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] create an account or purchase any of our services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);
  2. [CLS] [SEP] request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number);
  3. [CLS] [SEP] complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
  4. [CLS] [SEP] participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

however, we also collect additional information when delivering our services
to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. [CLS] [SEP] these methods of
collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and
explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):

**cookies and similar technologies** on our websites and our mobile
applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items
purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics,
about how you use and interact with our services. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies
automatically collect data when you use and interact with our services,
including metadata, log files, cookie/device ids, page load time, server
response time, and approximate location information to measure website
performance and improve our systems, including optimizing dns resolution,
network routing and server configurations. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, interactions with the
features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social
media plugins) contained within the services, internet protocol (ip) address,
browser type and settings, the date and time the services were used,
information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and
cookie data, information about devices accessing the services, including type
of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application ids,
unique device identifiers and error data is collected. [CLS] [SEP] all this allows us to
provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our
sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyze and improve the
performance of our services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect your location (ip address) so
that we can personalize our services. [CLS] [SEP] for additional information, and to learn
how to manage the technologies we utilize, please visit our [cookie
policy](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP] if you wish
to opt out of interest-based advertising click [here](http://preferences-
mgr.truste.com/) [or if located in the european union click
[here](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/)]. [CLS] [SEP] please note you will continue to
receive generic ads. [CLS] [SEP]

**supplemented data** may be received about you from other sources, including
publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased
data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have
about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our
records, assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new
customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]
if you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your
information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for
which it was provided to us. [CLS] [SEP]

****how we utilize information.****

we strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its
use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2)
as necessary to deliver the services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as
we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful
purposes:

**delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our services.** we collect
various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with
our services. [CLS] [SEP] we utilize this information to:

  * improve and optimize the operation and performance of our services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
  * diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the services
  * detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our services and systems
  * collecting aggregate statistics about use of the services
  * understand and analyze how you use our services and what products and services are most relevant to you. [CLS] [SEP]

much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how
individuals use our services, and is not linked to any personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**sharing with trusted third parties.** we may share your personal information
with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with
which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own
services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them
to perform services on our behalf, such as:

  * processing credit card payments
  * serving advertisements
  * conducting contests or surveys
  * performing analysis of our services and customers demographics
  * communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
  * customer relationship management
  * security, risk management and compliance
  * recruiting support and related services. [CLS] [SEP] 

these third parties (and any subcontractors they may be permitted to use) have
agreed not to share, use or retain your personal information for any purpose
other than as necessary for the provision of services. [CLS] [SEP]

we will also disclose your information to third parties:

  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or
  * if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. [CLS] [SEP] in such transactions, your information may be among the transferred assets. [CLS] [SEP]

**communicating with you.** we may contact you directly or through a third
party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or
purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service
related communications. [CLS] [SEP] we may also contact you with offers for additional
services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where
allowed based upon legitimate interests. [CLS] [SEP] you don’t need to provide consent as
a condition to purchase our goods or services. [CLS] [SEP] these contacts may include:

  * email
  * text (sms) messages
  * telephone calls
  * messenger applications (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] whatsapp, etc.)
  * automated phone calls or text messages. [CLS] [SEP]

you may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving
communications from us and/or our partners by signing into your account and
visiting “account settings” page. [CLS] [SEP]

if we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it
will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and
whose privacy policy applies. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, it will describe any choice options
you have in regards to the use and/or sharing of your personal information
with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options. [CLS] [SEP] we are
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites. [CLS] [SEP]
please read the privacy policy of any website you visit. [CLS] [SEP]

if you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. [CLS] [SEP] using
email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the
contacts and any other personal information for the requested service. [CLS] [SEP] if you
believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you
would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us
at [privacy@godaddy.com](mailto:privacy@godaddy.com). [CLS] [SEP]

**transfer of personal information abroad.** if you utilize our services from
a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal
information may be transferred across international borders, which will only
be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we
have your consent to do so, or when the appropriate standard contractual
clauses are in place. [CLS] [SEP] also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may
provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country
of origin. [CLS] [SEP]

**compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests.** we
cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to
enforce and comply with the law. [CLS] [SEP] we will disclose any information about you to
government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole
discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal
process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the
property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or
any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or
unethical. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps
to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal
information to third parties as part of legal process. [CLS] [SEP] we will also share your
information to the extent necessary to comply with any icann, registry or
cctld rules, regulations and policies when you register a domain name with us. [CLS] [SEP]
for reasons critical to maintaining the security, stability and resiliency of
the internet, this includes the transfer of domain name registration
information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider,
and publication of that information as required by icann in the public whois
database or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate legal
interest to such information. [CLS] [SEP]

****how we secure, store and retain your data.****

we follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal
information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored,
including utilization of encryption where appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

we retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the
services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal
or business purposes. [CLS] [SEP] these might include retention periods:

  * mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
  * for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or
  * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal
information, you can contact us at
[privacy@godaddy.com](mailto:privacy@godaddy.com). [CLS] [SEP]

****how you can access, update or delete your data.****

to easily access, view, update, delete or port your personal information, or
to update your subscription preferences, please sign into your account and
visit “account settings.” please visit our [trust
center](https://www.godaddy.com/trust-center) for additional information and
guidance for accessing, updating or deleting data. [CLS] [SEP]

if you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is
necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be
honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any services
purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or
contractual record keeping requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are unable for any reason to access your account settings or our trust
center, you may also contact us by one of the methods described in the
“contact us” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

****the e.u-u.s and swiss-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield frameworks.****

[![alt](https://img1.wsimg.com/sitecore/b/a/truste-verified-privacy-
logo.png)](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-
seal/validation?rid=97e75c6a-f9e7-467c-aa50-37378aff5354 "truste privacy
shield verified")

on july 16, 2020, the court of justice of the european union issued a judgment
declaring as “invalid” the european commission’s decision (eu) 2016/1250 of 12
july 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy
shield. [CLS] [SEP] as a result of that decision, the eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework is
no longer a valid mechanism to comply with eu data protection requirements
when transferring personal data from the european union to the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

nonetheless, the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce continues to administer the
privacy shield program, and our parent company, godaddy operating company, llc
(and our related entities, including godaddy.com llc, godaddy media temple,
inc., godaddy sellbrite, inc., domains by proxy, llc, and godaddy corporate
domains, llc) complies with the eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework as set forth
by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of personal information transferred from the european union to the
united states. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy operating company, llc has certified to the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
department of commerce that it adheres to the privacy shield principles. [CLS] [SEP] if
there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the privacy
shield principles, the privacy shield principles shall govern. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more
about the privacy shield program, and to view our certification, please visit
<https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. [CLS] [SEP]

godaddy.com, llc is responsible for the processing of personal information it
receives, under each privacy shield framework, and subsequently transfers to a
third party acting as an agent on its behalf. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy.com, llc complies with
the privacy shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information
from the eu and switzerland, including the onward transfer liability
provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

with respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each
privacy shield framework, godaddy.com, llc is subject to the regulatory
enforcement powers of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal trade commission. [CLS] [SEP] in certain
situations, godaddy.com, llc may be required to disclose personal information
in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet
national security or law enforcement requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not
addressed satisfactorily, please contact our u.s.-based third party dispute
resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-
form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. [CLS] [SEP] under certain conditions, more fully
described on the [privacy shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/), you
may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have
been exhausted. [CLS] [SEP]

in compliance with the privacy shield principles, godaddy.com, llc commits to
resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
eu and swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy
shield policy should first contact us in any manner provided in the "contact
us" section below in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

godaddy.com, llc has further committed to cooperate with the panel established
by the eu data protection authorities (dpas) and the swiss federal data
protection and information commissioner (fdpic) with regard to unresolved
privacy shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the
eu and switzerland in the context of the employment relationship. [CLS] [SEP]

****_‘do not track’_ notifications.****

some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to
track you using a “do not track” signal. [CLS] [SEP] there is no consensus among industry
participants as to what “do not track” means in this context. [CLS] [SEP] like many
websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we
receive a “do not track” signal from a visitor’s browser. [CLS] [SEP] to find out more
about “do not track,” you may wish to visit
[www.allaboutdnt.com](https://allaboutdnt.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

****age restrictions.****

our services are available for purchase only for those over the age of 18. [CLS] [SEP] our
services are not targeted to, intended to be consumed by or designed to entice
individuals under the age of 18. [CLS] [SEP] if you know of or have reason to believe
anyone under the age of 18 has provided us with any personal information,
please contact us. [CLS] [SEP]

****non-discrimination.****

we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy
rights. [CLS] [SEP] unless permitted under applicable laws, we will not:

  * deny you goods or services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provide you a different level or quality of goods or services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. [CLS] [SEP]

****changes to this policy.****

we reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if we decide
to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any,
we disclose it. [CLS] [SEP] if we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will
notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page, at least
thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]

****contact us.****

if you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our privacy policy,
or how we handle your personal data, you may contact our office of the data
protection officer by email at privacy@godaddy.com. [CLS] [SEP] in the alternative, you
may contact us by either of the following means:
