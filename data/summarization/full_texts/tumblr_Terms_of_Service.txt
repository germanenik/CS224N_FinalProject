# terms of servicelast modified: 2019-09-25

tumblr is a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] company and subject to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] laws and jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] the
original version of these terms of service (and any other terms, policies, or
guidelines that we provide to you) are written in english. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent any
translated version of these terms of service (or any other terms, policies, or
guidelines that we provide to you) conflicts with the english version, the
english version controls. [CLS] [SEP]

**these terms of service contain limitations of tumblr 's liability in section
14. [CLS] [SEP] **

hello! welcome to tumblr’s terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] please read this carefully before
using our site, services, or products. [CLS] [SEP] this is a contract between you and
tumblr. [CLS] [SEP] we've also included several annotations that aren't a part of the
contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help you
follow the text. [CLS] [SEP] we've tried to be fair and straightforward. [CLS] [SEP] please feel free
to [contact us](https://www.tumblr.com/support) if you have any questions or
suggestions!

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] accepting the terms of service

please read these terms of service and our [community
guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/community) (collectively, the "
**agreement** ") carefully before using tumblr.com (the " **site** ") and/or
the other domains, websites, products, applications, mobile applications,
services, and/or content provided by tumblr, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (all of those collectively
with the site, the " **services** ") (tumblr, inc., a delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of automattic inc., a delaware corporation ("
**automattic** "), collectively with its agents, representatives, consultants,
employees, officers, and directors, " **tumblr** ," " **we** ," or " **us**
"). [CLS] [SEP] by using or accessing the services, you (" **subscriber** " or " **you**
") agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you
don't agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, you shouldn't,
and aren't permitted to, use the services. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr’s personalized services
cannot be provided and the terms of this agreement cannot be performed without
tumblr processing information about you and other users. [CLS] [SEP] processing of the
information you share with tumblr is essential to the personalized services
which we provide and which you expect, including personalized content (as
described below) and ads, and is a necessary part of our performance of the
agreement we have with you. [CLS] [SEP]

we’re just letting you know, here, that tumblr is now part of
[automattic](https://automattic.com/), a technology company that empowers
people to build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow
their audience and these [terms of
service](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms-of-service) , which apply to
your use of tumblr, have been updated to reflect this change. [CLS] [SEP] this section
also includes an agreement where you're agreeing to agree to the terms of this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] modifications to this agreement

tumblr reserves the right to modify this agreement by (1) posting a revised
agreement on and/or through the services and (2) providing notice to you that
this agreement has changed, generally via email where practicable, and
otherwise through the services (such as through a notification on your tumblr
dashboard or in our mobile applications). [CLS] [SEP] modifications will not apply
retroactively. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with
any modifications to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

we may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a
revised version of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, modifications will be
effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

in cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified version
of this agreement, but otherwise provide notice as set forth above, the
modified version of this agreement will become effective fourteen days after
we have posted the modified agreement and provided you notification of the
modifications. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the services following that period constitutes your
acceptance of the terms and conditions of this agreement as modified. [CLS] [SEP] if you
do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and should
discontinue your use of, the services. [CLS] [SEP]

note that, if you have prepaid for any paid services (as defined below) prior
to a modification of this agreement, your use of such prepaid paid services is
governed by the version of this agreement in effect at the time tumblr
received your prepayment. [CLS] [SEP]

as tumblr grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these terms of
service. [CLS] [SEP] when we do, we'll let you know. [CLS] [SEP] we're also going to make it a
practice to post old versions so it's easy to see changes/additions/deletions. [CLS] [SEP]
to see old versions, scroll down to the end of this document. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] use of the services

 **eligibility:**

you may not use the services, provide any personal information to tumblr, or
otherwise submit personal information through the services (including, for
example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address) if you are under
the minimum age. [CLS] [SEP] the minimum age is (i) thirteen (13), or (ii) for users in
the european union, sixteen (16) (or the lower age that your country has
provided for you to consent to the processing of your personal data) . [CLS] [SEP] you may
only use the services if you can form a binding contract with tumblr and are
not legally prohibited from using the services. [CLS] [SEP]

you have to be the minimum age to use tumblr. [CLS] [SEP] we're serious: it's a hard rule. [CLS] [SEP]
"but i'm, like, almost old enough!" you plead. [CLS] [SEP] nope, sorry. [CLS] [SEP] if you're not old
enough, don't use tumblr. [CLS] [SEP] ask your parents for a playstation 4, or try books. [CLS] [SEP]

**service changes and limitations:**

the services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change
without prior notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr retains the right to create limits on and
related to use of the services in its sole discretion at any time with or
without notice. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr may also impose limits on certain services or aspects
of those services or restrict your access to parts or all of the services
without notice or liability. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr may change, suspend, or discontinue any or
all of the services at any time, including the availability of any product,
feature, database, or content (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP] tumblr may also terminate or
suspend accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr is an ever-evolving platform. [CLS] [SEP] with new products, services, and features
launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits,
and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that
flop). [CLS] [SEP] we can also terminate or suspend any account at any time. [CLS] [SEP] that sounds
harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these
terms of service, our [privacy
policy](https://www.tumblr.com/privacy/automattic) , and our [community
guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/community). [CLS] [SEP]

**limitations on automated use:**

you may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the following
while accessing or using the services: (a) tamper with, or use non-public
areas of the services, or the computer or delivery systems of tumblr and/or
its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network
(particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or
circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or
attempt to access or search the services by any means (automated or otherwise)
other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are
provided by tumblr (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions) or unless
permitted by tumblr's robots.txt file or other robot exclusion mechanisms; (d)
scrape the services, and particularly scrape content (as defined below) from
the services; (e) use the services to send altered, deceptive, or false
source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging tcp-ip
packet headers or email headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or
attempt to do so), the access of any subscriber, host or network, including,
without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the
services, or by scripted use of the services in such a manner as to interfere
with or create an undue burden on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

don't do bad things to tumblr or to other users. [CLS] [SEP] some particularly egregious
examples of "bad things" are listed in this section. [CLS] [SEP]

##  4\. [CLS] [SEP] registration, tumblr urls, and security

as a condition to using certain of the services and in order for us to provide
them to you, you may be required to create an account (an " **account** "),
provide your age and an email address and select a password and tumblr
username, which will serve as a default link to your default tumblr blog of
the form [username].tumblr.com (a " **tumblr url** "). [CLS] [SEP] you must select a
different tumblr url for each new blog you create. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to provide tumblr with accurate, complete, and updated registration
information, particularly your email address. [CLS] [SEP]

it's really important that the email address associated with your tumblr
account is accurate and up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP] if you ever forget your password - or
worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address is
often the only way for us to recover your account. [CLS] [SEP]

you are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
password and for the security of your account, and you will notify tumblr
immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of
your account or account password. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] privacy

for information about how tumblr collects, uses, and shares your information,
please review our [privacy policy](https://www.tumblr.com/privacy/automattic). [CLS] [SEP]
by using the services you agree you have read the privacy policy, which
describes our collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the privacy
policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to the
united states and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use by
tumblr and the tumblr affiliates (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] content and subscriber content

 **definitions:**

for purposes of this agreement: (1) the term " **content** " means a creative
expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs,
images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies,
comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files,
graphics, themes (as defined below), and interactive features, any of which
may be generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the
services; (2) the term " **subscriber content** " means content that a
subscriber submits, transfers, or otherwise provides to the services. [CLS] [SEP] content
includes, without limitation, all subscriber content. [CLS] [SEP]

**your rights in subscriber content:**

subscribers retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in subscriber
content, and tumblr and/or third parties retain ownership and/or other
applicable rights in all content other than subscriber content. [CLS] [SEP]

you retain ownership you have of any intellectual property you post to tumblr. [CLS] [SEP]

**subscriber content license to tumblr:**

when you provide subscriber content to tumblr through the services, you grant
tumblr a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable
right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display
(publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute,
transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it
to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which
the services are available), and create derivative works of, such subscriber
content. [CLS] [SEP] the rights you grant in this license are for the limited purposes of
allowing tumblr to operate the services in accordance with their
functionality, improve and promote the services, and develop new services. [CLS] [SEP] the
reference in this license to "creat[ing] derivative works" is not intended to
give tumblr a right to make substantive editorial changes or derivations, but
does, for example, enable **reblogging** , which allows tumblr subscribers to
redistribute subscriber content from one tumblr blog to another in a manner
that allows them to add their own text or other content before or after your
subscriber content. [CLS] [SEP]

when you upload your creations to tumblr, you're giving us permission to make
them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example, via your
blog, rss, the tumblr dashboard, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] we never want to do anything with your
work that surprises you. [CLS] [SEP]

something else worth noting: countless tumblr blogs have gone on to spawn
books, films, albums, brands, and more. [CLS] [SEP] any royalties or reimbursement you get
for your creations are, needless to say, entirely yours. [CLS] [SEP] it's your work, and
we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish. [CLS] [SEP]

you also agree that this license includes the right for tumblr to make all
publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by tumblr, so that
those third parties can syndicate and/or analyze such content on other media
and services. [CLS] [SEP]

an example of what it means to "make all publicly-posted content available" to
a tumblr partner for distribution or analysis would be licensing the tumblr
"firehose," a live feed of all public activity on tumblr, to partners like
search engines. [CLS] [SEP]

note also that this license to your subscriber content continues even if you
stop using the services, primarily because of the social nature of content
shared through tumblr's services - when you post something publicly, others
may choose to comment on it, making your content part of a social conversation
that can't later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of
others. [CLS] [SEP]

one thing you should consider before posting: when you make something publicly
available on the internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all
copies of it. [CLS] [SEP]

you also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of
others, and represent and warrant that you have all of the necessary rights to
grant us this license for all subscriber content you transfer to us. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr may add its own affiliate code to links posted on tumblr at its
discretion, provided a user has not previously included their own affiliate
code into the applicable link. [CLS] [SEP] users may opt out of this functionality
[here](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/blog). [CLS] [SEP]

**content license to you:**

as a subscriber of the services, tumblr grants you a worldwide, revocable,
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download,
store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create derivative works of
content solely in connection with your use of, and in strict accordance with
the functionality and restrictions of, the services (including, without
limitation, paid services, as defined below). [CLS] [SEP] this means, for example, that we
license content to you for purposes of reblogging. [CLS] [SEP]

**compliance with community guidelines:**

you agree that you won't violate tumblr's [community
guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/community). [CLS] [SEP]

**termination and deletion:**

on termination of your account, or upon your deletion of particular pieces of
subscriber content from the services, tumblr shall make reasonable efforts to
make such subscriber content inaccessible and cease use of it and, if required
by the applicable privacy policy, delete your account data and / or subscriber
content unless permitted or required to keep this data in accordance with law;
however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) deleted subscriber content may
persist in caches or backups for a reasonable period of time and (b) copies of
or references to the subscriber content may not be entirely removed (due to
the nature of reblogging, for example). [CLS] [SEP] you can delete your account at any
time [here](https://www.tumblr.com/account/delete). [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] special provisions for application developers

if you develop software or services based on the services or any content,
whether using the [tumblr application programming
interface](https://www.tumblr.com/developers) or not, you will agree to and
comply with the [tumblr application developer and api license
agreement](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/api_agreement). [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] use of trademarks

any use of tumblr's trademarks, branding, logos, and other such assets in
connection with the services shall use [tumblr’s approved
branding](https://www.tumblr.com/logo) and shall be in accordance with the
[tumblr trademark
guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/trademark_guidelines). [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] themes

tumblr makes available specialized html and css code (" **tumblr template
code** ") for the design and layout of blog pages available for use on some of
the services (" **themes** "). [CLS] [SEP] certain themes are available for purchase as a
paid service (as defined below) (such themes, " **premium themes** "). [CLS] [SEP]
purchased premium themes may not be transferred between accounts, between
blogs, or between services on a single account and are subject to the payment
terms herein. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr grants you a license to customize the tumblr template code to create
your own themes for use on your blog page (each a " **custom theme** "). [CLS] [SEP] if
you choose, you may also contribute your custom themes for use by other
subscribers as subscriber content. [CLS] [SEP] however, as a condition of this license
allowing you to create custom themes, you agree that you won't distribute such
custom themes from locations other than tumblr-owned or approved websites
without our permission, as set out in our [community
guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/community). [CLS] [SEP]

note also that other subscribers may use your custom themes after you have
removed them from distribution, and you hereby grant those subscribers an
irrevocable license to use those custom themes as contributed by you. [CLS] [SEP] in other
words, you can remove and stop distribution of your custom themes, but
subscribers who are already using them can keep using them. [CLS] [SEP]

to develop and distribute custom themes that are premium themes, please
[contact us](https://www.tumblr.com/support). [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] paid services

some of the services require payment of fees (the " **paid services** ,"
including without limitation premium themes). [CLS] [SEP] all fees are stated in united
states dollars. [CLS] [SEP] you shall pay all applicable fees, as described in the
applicable services, in connection with such services, and any related taxes
or additional charges. [CLS] [SEP]

paid services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay aspects
of the services. [CLS] [SEP] usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or similar
terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use paid services, and do
not represent any transfer of any right, title, or ownership interest of any
kind. [CLS] [SEP] you may not relicense, resell, transfer, or exchange paid services
within or outside of the services, except as expressly allowed by the rules of
those paid services. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or eliminate,
paid services, or the terms and conditions under which paid services are
provided. [CLS] [SEP]

purchases of paid services are final and non-refundable (particularly those
paid services that may be used immediately, such as promotions, as defined
below), except at tumblr's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules
governing each paid service. [CLS] [SEP] termination of your account or your rights under
this agreement may result in forfeiture of purchased paid services. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, if your account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any premium
themes you have purchased. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr may change its prices for paid services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent
applicable, tumblr will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing
changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable paid service
and/or by sending you an email notification. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to pay the new
prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable paid
service prior to the change going into effect. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] special provisions for promotions

some features of the services may allow you to promote yourself to other
subscribers, and some of these features may be paid services (" **promotions**
"). [CLS] [SEP]

the following additional terms apply to promotions:

things that you promote will comply with this agreement; if they don't, tumblr
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel a promotion without
refund or recourse to you. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr may remove or disable any promotion for any reason in its sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

unless otherwise specified, tumblr does not guarantee any activity that
promotions may receive, including but not limited to clicks, likes, and
reblogs. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr cannot control how subscribers interact with promotions and is
not responsible for "click fraud" or other fraudulent actions by third
parties, including, without limitation, subscribers. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr doesn't guarantee
that its reporting related to promotions will be accurate or complete, nor
does it guarantee that promotions will behave in a particular manner, and
tumblr shall not be liable to you or responsible for any erroneous reporting
about or errant behavior of or related to promotions (e.g., any errors in how
likes or reblogs are counted). [CLS] [SEP]

promotions may allow targeting to some subscriber characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr does
not guarantee that any particular promotion will reach a particular sort of
individual in all cases. [CLS] [SEP]

you can cancel certain promotions at any time depending on their
functionality, but you are responsible for paying for promotions at least to
the extent they have already been used or distributed through the services. [CLS] [SEP]

by submitting a promotion, you license tumblr to run that promotion for as
long as you have specified, which, depending on the promotion, may be
perpetually. [CLS] [SEP] this license ends when the promotion has been completed or
cancelled, but it may take up to forty eight (48) hours for a promotion to
stop being reflected on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

##  12\. [CLS] [SEP] warranty disclaimer; services available on an "as is" basis

your access to and use of the services or any content is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand and agree that the services are provided to you on an "as is" and
"as available" basis. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, to the full extent
permitted by law, tumblr disclaims all warranties, express or implied, of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr
makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the
services, including any representation or warranty that the use of the
services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in
combination with any other hardware, software, system, or data, (b) meet your
requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be
corrected, (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components; or (e) be
entirely secure or that the information you share with us will be secure. [CLS] [SEP]
tumblr also makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to
content; subscriber content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the
responsibility of, the subscribers providing that content. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or
information, whether oral or written, obtained from tumblr or through the
services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] time limitation on claims and releases from liability

you agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to this
agreement or your relationship with tumblr must be filed within one year after
such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]

you further release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, tumblr and its
employees, agents, consultants, directors, shareholders, any other person or
entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or
is directly or indirectly controlled by, tumblr (the "tumblr affiliates") from
responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including but not
limited to claims of negligence), arising out of or related to the following:

disputes between subscribers, including those between you and other
subscribers. [CLS] [SEP]

the acts of third parties generally (i.e., individuals or entities who are not
tumblr or a tumblr affiliate), including third party sites and services. [CLS] [SEP]

disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your account by you or a
third party. [CLS] [SEP]

claims relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications relating
to, or content stored under or relating to, your account, including but not
limited to unauthorized interception, use, or alteration of such
communications or your content. [CLS] [SEP] for the sake of clarity, this includes any and
all claims related to the security of your account credentials. [CLS] [SEP]

claims relating to any face-to-face meetings in any way related to tumblr at
any venues (" **meetups** "), including without limitation claims related to
the actions or omissions of any subscribers or third parties who organize,
attend, or are otherwise involved in any meetups. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise expressly
disclosed in writing, tumblr does not sponsor, oversee, or in any manner
control meetups. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a california resident, you waive california civil code § 1542,
which says: "a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement
with the debtor."

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, tumblr and the tumblr
affiliates shall not be liable for: (a) any indirect, incidental, exemplary
punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever; (b) loss of:
profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses; (c) damages
relating to your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the
services; (d) damages relating to any conduct or content of any third party or
subscriber using the services, including without limitation, defamatory,
offensive or illegal conduct or content; and/or (e) damages in any manner
relating to any content. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation applies to all claims, whether based
on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, whether or not tumblr
has been informed of the possibility of such damage, and further where a
remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total liability of
tumblr and the tumblr affiliates, for any claim under this agreement,
including for any implied warranties, is limited to the greater of one hundred
dollars (us $100.00) or the amount you paid us to use the applicable
service(s). [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] exclusions to warranties and limitation of liability

some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in section 14, so the
limitations above may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

## 16\. [CLS] [SEP] termination

either party may terminate this agreement at any time by notifying the other
party. [CLS] [SEP] tumblr may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any
and all services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the
terms or conditions of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, tumblr may immediately
terminate or suspend accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright
infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

upon termination of your access to or ability to use a service, including but
not limited to suspension of your account on a service, your right to use or
access that service and any content will immediately cease. [CLS] [SEP] all provisions of
this agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive
termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
disclaimers, and limitations of liability. [CLS] [SEP] termination of your access to and
use of the services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or
accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability that you otherwise
may have to tumblr or any third party and shall not relieve you of your rights
if you are a user in the european economic area which are described in the
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 17\. [CLS] [SEP] choice of law and venue

you and tumblr agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or
equity that arises out of this agreement or the services in accordance with
this section or as you and tumblr otherwise agree in writing. [CLS] [SEP] before resorting
to formal dispute resolution, we strongly encourage you to [contact
us](https://www.tumblr.com/support) to seek a resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

**law and forum for legal disputes:**

this agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of
new york as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within new york between new york residents, without regard to conflict of law
provisions. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against tumblr
must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in new york
county, new york, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within new york
county, new york for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are (a) a united states federal, state, or local government agency or
body, (b) using the services in your official capacity, and (c) legally unable
to accept the clauses in this section, then this section doesn't apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]
for such entities, this agreement and any related action will be governed by
the laws of the united states of america, without regard to conflict of law
provisions, and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted
under federal law, the laws of the state of new york, excluding choice of law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 18\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous

this agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire
agreement between you and tumblr with respect to the subject matter hereof. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or
agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and
constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. [CLS] [SEP] the
failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right provided for herein
shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision
of this agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
agreement shall otherwise remain enforceable and in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except
