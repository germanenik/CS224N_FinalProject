forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the site and the
products and services purchased or accessed through this site (individually
and collectively, the “ _services_ ”). [CLS] [SEP] services agreements and additional
policies apply to certain services and are in addition to (not in lieu of)
this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a conflict between the provisions of a
services agreement and the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of the
applicable services agreement shall control. [CLS] [SEP]

agreement, has access to your account or uses the services. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this
agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits. [CLS] [SEP]

determined by godaddy in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and

godaddy reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of the (i)
services or (ii) individual features, functionalities, or aspects of the
services at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP] although
godaddy makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its services and
features, functionalities, or aspects of the services, there are times when a
service or specific feature, functionality, or aspect of a service that we
offer will be discontinued or reach its end-of-life ("eol"). [CLS] [SEP] if that is the
case, those services, or the specific feature, functionality, or aspect of
that service, will no longer be supported by godaddy, in any way, effective on
the eol date. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
__notice and migration.__ in the event that any service we offer has reached
or will reach eol, we will attempt to notify you thirty or more days in
advance of the eol date. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to take all necessary steps
to replace the service by migrating to a new service before the eol date, or
by entirely ceasing reliance on said service before the eol date. [CLS] [SEP] in either
case, godaddy will either offer a comparable service for you to migrate to for
the remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store credit, or a
prorated refund, to be determined by godaddy in its sole and absolute
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy may, with or without notice to you, migrate you to the
most up-to-date version of the service, if available. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to take full
responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such migration. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event that a feature, functionality, or aspect of any service we offer
has reached or will reach eol, then we will attempt to notify you thirty or
more days in advance of the eol date. [CLS] [SEP] however, if the service maintains a
least reasonably equivalent functionality without such feature, functionality,
or aspect, as determined by godaddy in its sole and absolute discretion,
godaddy will not be required to offer a comparable feature or functionality
for the service or a refund. [CLS] [SEP]

__no liability.__ godaddy will not be liable to you or any third party for any
modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the services we may
offer or facilitate access to. [CLS] [SEP]

new features to existing services) in a pre-release version. [CLS] [SEP] new services, new

**_(a) general terms, including automatic renewal terms_**

__payment due at time of order; non-refundable.__ you agree to pay all amounts
due for services at the time you order them. [CLS] [SEP] all amounts are non-refundable
unless otherwise noted in the [refund
policy](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/refund-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

__price changes.__ godaddy reserves the right to change its prices and fees at
any time, and such changes shall be posted online at this site and effective
immediately without need for further notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you have purchased or
obtained services for a period of months or years, changes in prices and fees
shall be effective when the services in question come up for renewal as
further described below. [CLS] [SEP]

__payment types.__ except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you
may pay for services by using any of the following “payment methods”: (i)
valid credit card, (ii) “good as gold prepaid services” (defined below); (iii)
electronic payment from your personal or business checking account, as
appropriate (and as defined below); (iv) paypal, (v) international payment
option (as defined below) or (vi) via in-store credit balances, if applicable
(and as defined below), each a “payment method”. [CLS] [SEP] the “express checkout”
feature automatically places an order for the applicable service and charges
the default express checkout payment method for your account. [CLS] [SEP] confirmation of
that order will be sent to the email address on file for your account. [CLS] [SEP] your
payment method on file must be kept valid if you have any active services in
your account. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you agree that the location for the processing of
your payments may change for any reason, including the type of payment method
chosen, the currency selected, or changes or updates made to your payment
method. [CLS] [SEP]

__refunds issued.__ you agree that where refunds are issued to your payment
method, godaddy's issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that
godaddy has submitted your refund to the payment method charged at the time of
the original sale, and that godaddy has no control over when the refund will
be applied towards your payment method’s available balance. [CLS] [SEP] you further
acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank
associated with your payment method establish and regulate the time frames for
posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from
five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event a refund is issued to your payment method and the payment
provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your
payment method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited
to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds
allowed, then godaddy, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit; (ii) via
issuance of a godaddy check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file
for your account; or (iii) in some jurisdictions, as a bank transfer, when the
payment processor cannot refund back to the payment method. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy also has
the right to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if
there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

__monthly billing date.__ if you are being billed on a monthly basis, your
monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the
services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case
your billing date will be the 28th of each month. [CLS] [SEP]

__auto-renewal terms.__ other than as required by applicable law, godaddy does
not retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or
standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to your usage
of our automatic renewal services, and we are therefore unable to provide any
such document upon request. [CLS] [SEP] you may view or change your automatic renewal
settings at any time by logging into your godaddy account. [CLS] [SEP]

**in order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of
services, all services are offered on automatic renewal. [CLS] [SEP] except for reasons
described below in this section, automatic renewal automatically renews the
applicable service upon expiration of the then current term for a renewal
period equal in time to the most recent service period (except for domain
names which may renew for the original service period). [CLS] [SEP] for example, if your
last service period is for one year, your renewal period will typically be for
one year. [CLS] [SEP] however, in the event renewal with the payment method on file fails,
godaddy may attempt to renew the applicable service for a period less than the
original subscription period to the extent necessary for the transaction to
succeed.**

**unless you disable the automatic renewal option, godaddy will automatically
renew the applicable service when it comes up for renewal and will take
payment from the payment method associated with the service(s) in your account
or your designated backup payment method(s) on file with godaddy. [CLS] [SEP] in
automatically renewing your services, godaddy will first attempt to charge the
payment method associated with the service(s) in your account. [CLS] [SEP] in the event
godaddy cannot successfully charge this payment method, we will attempt to
charge the payment method(s) designated as "backup" in your account. [CLS] [SEP] renewals
will be charged at godaddy’s then current rates, which you acknowledge and
agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period. [CLS] [SEP]
in order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your services,
simply log into your account manager from this site and follow the steps found
[here](https://www.godaddy.com/help/manually-renew-my-products-or-
services-725). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish for any service to automatically renew, you
may elect to cancel renewal, in which case, your services will terminate upon
expiration of the then current term, unless you manually renew your services
prior to that date. [CLS] [SEP] in other words, should you elect to cancel your product
and fail to manually renew your services before they expire, you may
experience an interruption or loss of services, and godaddy shall not be
liable to you or any third party regarding the same.**

**in addition, godaddy may participate in “recurring billing programs” or
“account updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and
ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation). [CLS] [SEP] if we are unable to
successfully charge your existing payment method, your credit card provider
(or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or
expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our
behalf without notification to us. [CLS] [SEP] in accordance with recurring billing
program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your
credit card number and/or expiration date, godaddy will automatically update
your payment profile on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy makes no guarantees that we will
request or receive updated credit card information. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree
that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your account
settings, including but not limited to (i) cancelling products and (ii)
ensuring your associated payment method(s) are current and valid. [CLS] [SEP] further, you
acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the
interruption or loss of services, and godaddy shall not be liable to you or
any third party regarding the same.**

if for any reason godaddy is unable to charge your payment method for the full
amount owed, or if godaddy receives notification of a chargeback, reversal,
payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to
your payment method, you agree that godaddy may pursue all available lawful
remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate
cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or services
registered or renewed on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy also reserves the right to
charge you reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks godaddy may perform
outside the normal scope of its services, (ii) additional time and/or costs
godaddy may incur in providing its services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance
with this agreement (as determined by godaddy in its sole and absolute
discretion). [CLS] [SEP] typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but
are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional
personal time or attention; (ii) udrp actions(s) in connection with your
domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services,
whether performed by godaddy staff or by outside firms retained by godaddy;
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of services,
incurred by godaddy as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes
brought by you, your bank or payment method processor. [CLS] [SEP] these administrative
fees or processing fees will be billed to the payment method you have on file
with godaddy. [CLS] [SEP]

godaddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies. [CLS] [SEP] the transaction
will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during
the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment. [CLS] [SEP] for
certain payment methods, the issuer of your payment method may charge you a
foreign transaction fee or other charge, which may be added to the final
amount that appears on your bank statement or post as a separate amount. [CLS] [SEP]
please check with the issuer of your payment method for details. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be
charged value added tax (" _vat_ "), goods and services tax (" _gst_ "), or
other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country
indicated in your billing address section. [CLS] [SEP]

funded into your good as gold account. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby expressly authorize
godaddy(i) to reduce your good as gold account by the amount of wire transfer

any time, and such changes shall be posted online and effective immediately

agreement), then the balance in your good as gold account will be refunded,
net the service fee. [CLS] [SEP]

additional funds may be added to your good as gold account at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

checking account (“checking account”), as appropriate). [CLS] [SEP] in connection, you
agree to allow a third-party check services provider, certegy check services,

which will be presented to your bank or financial institution for payment from
your checking account. [CLS] [SEP] the checking account must be at a financial institution
in the united states, and payment must be in u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP]

it is your responsibility to keep your checking account current and funded. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that (i) check services provider or godaddy reserve the right to
decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments
that fail to go through as a result of your checking account no longer
existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event,
neither check services provider nor godaddy shall be liable to you or any
third party regarding the same. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason check services provider is
unable to withdraw the full amount owed for the services provided, you agree
that check services provider and godaddy may pursue all available lawful
remedies in order to obtain payment (plus any applicable fees). [CLS] [SEP] godaddy is not
responsible for the actions of check services provider. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that if the
eft or bank draft is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge in
accordance with the fees permitted by law for each u.s. [CLS] [SEP] state. [CLS] [SEP] a help article
describing the check services provider and outlining the service charges

the services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed. [CLS] [SEP] such
notices may not be received if you violate these terms of service by accessing
the services in an unauthorized manner. [CLS] [SEP] your agreement to these terms of
service constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any
and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the services
in an authorized manner. [CLS] [SEP] failure to receive such notices for any reason shall
not excuse any payment or other obligation to godaddy and check services
provider. [CLS] [SEP] you further expressly authorize godaddy and its service providers,
including but not limited to check services provider and complete payment
recovery services, inc., and their affiliates to contact you, via auto-dialer,

**_(e) international payment options_**

godaddy offers a variety of alternative international payment options through
a variety of international payment providers (“ipp”). [CLS] [SEP] in the event you select
an ipp, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the ipp’s
applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your
transaction at godaddy. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to allow the ipp to debit the full
amount of your purchase from the selected account or payment method,
collectively “funding sources”. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you agree to allow the selected
ipp to debit, if applicable, an “exchange rate conversion fee”, as well as any
other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the ipp (collectively,
the “ipp fees”), from your funding sources. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that ipp
fees are subject to change at any time by the ipp without notice to you by
godaddy. [CLS] [SEP]

it is your responsibility to keep your funding sources current and funded. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree that (i) the ipp or godaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction
for any reason and (ii) neither the ipp nor godaddy shall be liable to you or
any third party regarding the same. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that godaddy will not
attempt to fulfill the services purchased by you until godaddy receives
confirmation of payment from the ipp through its associated payment processor. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time
you place an order and the time the ipp confirms payment through its
associated payment processor. [CLS] [SEP] if godaddy does not receive confirmation of
payment from the ipp through its associated payment processor within thirty
(30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which
time you will need to commence the purchase process again. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that
you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the
order through your godaddy account. [CLS] [SEP] payments received on previously cancelled
orders will be automatically refunded to the original payment method when
possible. [CLS] [SEP]

if, at the time godaddy receives confirmation of payment from the ipp (through
its associated payment processor), either (i) the services (including domain
names) are no longer available for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been
cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match
the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is
either over-funded or under-funded, godaddy may automatically issue a partial
refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-
funding) to your funding source. [CLS] [SEP] if the ipp (or its associated payment
processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, godaddy reserves the right
to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance or as a bank transfer, when the
payment processor cannot refund back to the payment method. [CLS] [SEP] if you receive a
full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
the ipp reserves the right not to refund ipp fees associated with a refunded
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, any refunds issued by godaddy will be net of the ipp
fees unless otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP]

godaddy offers sepa direct debit (“sepa”) as a payment method for customers
located in germany. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to use sepa as a payment method, you are
authorizing godaddy and adyen, our payment service provider, to send
instructions to your bank to debit your account. [CLS] [SEP] by agreeing to these terms
you have mandated godaddy to collect all of the applicable charges arising
under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the authorization shall also apply to any new bank
account used by you for purchases from godaddy. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you of the date
of direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the “pre-notification”). [CLS] [SEP]
this pre-notification will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1)
business day before payment is collected. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for making sure
that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any debit payments. [CLS] [SEP]
you also agree to indemnify godaddy against any losses that it may incur if
your financial institution withholds payment from godaddy for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

**_(f) in-store credit balances_**

in the event that your account contains an in-store credit balance: (1) you
may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your account;
and (2) you authorize godaddy to apply any available credit balance to any
outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your
account. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that godaddy is unable to successfully charge either the
payment method associated with a specific service in your account or your
backup payment methods when processing service renewals, godaddy may use any
available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the
entire transaction. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in
your account, godaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting
from an inability to collect funds from your payment methods or the in-store
credit. [CLS] [SEP] in-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the
shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). [CLS] [SEP] if you have more than one
in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of
the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first. [CLS] [SEP] if additional
funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-
selected currency will be converted using godaddy’s daily exchange rate based
on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are
allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance
left in your account. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that at the time of conversion,
godaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee. [CLS] [SEP]

you can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time through your
account on the godaddy website. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that in-store credit balances
are non-transferable, may only be used in the account in which they were
acquired and may expire. [CLS] [SEP] complimentary in-store credits will expire two years
after issuance or within any other time period godaddy may specify in your
account. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that godaddy terminates your account, you acknowledge
and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be
forfeited. [CLS] [SEP]

you also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will
be held by godaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] to the
extent any interest may accrue, you agree that godaddy is entitled to receive
and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-
store credit balance functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

**_(g) expired domain name purchases_**

for expired domains names purchased through your account, you agree that you
are responsible for payment within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for
the successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal or transfer fee (from
the end of the domain name’s previous registration period), plus icann fee, if
applicable, or any valid payment method associated with the account, will be
charged on the third day following the auction close. [CLS] [SEP] if we are unable to
collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the domain name. [CLS] [SEP]

**_(h) round up for charity_**

if you participate in round up for charity, you hereby authorize godaddy to
either 1) donate an amount selected by you, or 2) round up your transaction to
the nearest dollar and donate 100% of the difference, to a small business
relief fund (“donation”). [CLS] [SEP] godaddy will take reasonable steps to ensure your
donation is properly disbursed, in our sole discretion, to qualifying small
businesses negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic and will not withhold
any donation made by you through round up for charity. [CLS] [SEP] you understand your
donation is not eligible for a refund or in-store credit. [CLS] [SEP]

**  
**22\. [CLS] [SEP] disputes, binding individual arbitration and waiver of class actions
and class arbitrations** **

please read this section carefully. [CLS] [SEP] follow the instructions below if you wish
to opt out of the provisions requiring you to resolve disputes through
individual arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

(a) _disputes._ the terms of this section shall apply to all disputes between
you and godaddy, except for disputes governed by the uniform domain name
dispute resolution policy referenced above and available
[here](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/domain-name-dispute-
resolution-policy). [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this section, “dispute” shall mean any
dispute, claim, or action between you and godaddy arising under or relating to
any godaddy services or products, godaddy’s websites, these terms, or any
other transaction involving you and godaddy, whether in contract, warranty,
misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation,
ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to
be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. [CLS] [SEP] you and godaddy agree that
“dispute” as defined in these terms shall not include any claim or cause of
action by you or godaddy for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent
infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, and (iv) trademark
infringement or dilution. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these
terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls
within one of these four exceptions. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) _binding arbitration._ you and godaddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all
disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these terms; (ii)
these terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (iii) the
federal arbitration act (9 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this section; and (iv) this section shall survive termination
of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration means that you waive your right to a judge or jury
in a court proceeding and your grounds for appeal are limited. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as
limited by the limitation of liability set forth in section 19 of this
agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, in some
instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and
the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. [CLS] [SEP] the
decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with
jurisdiction over the parties. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) _small claims court._ notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an
individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if
the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that
court. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) _dispute notice._ in the event of a dispute, you or godaddy must first
send to the other party a notice of the dispute that shall include a written
statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the
party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief
requested (the “dispute notice”). [CLS] [SEP] the dispute notice to godaddy must be
addressed to: godaddy, 14455 n. [CLS] [SEP] hayden rd., scottsdale, az 85260, attn.: legal
department (the “godaddy notice address”). [CLS] [SEP] the dispute notice to you will be
sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise
in our records for you. [CLS] [SEP] if godaddy and you do not reach an agreement to
resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days after the dispute notice is
received, you or godaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to
this section. [CLS] [SEP] following submission and receipt of the dispute notice, each of
us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the dispute before
commencing arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

(e) _waiver of class actions and class arbitrations._ you and godaddy agree
that each party may bring disputes against the other party only in an
individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class or representative proceeding, including without limitation federal or
state class actions, or class arbitrations. [CLS] [SEP] neither you nor godaddy will seek
to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action,
or in any other proceeding in which either party acts of proposes to act in a
representative capacity. [CLS] [SEP] no arbitration or other proceeding will be combined
with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected
arbitrations or proceedings. [CLS] [SEP]

(f) _arbitration procedure._ if a party elects to commence arbitration, the
arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration association
(“aaa”) and governed by the consumer arbitration rules of the aaa (“aaa
rules”) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these terms, except that
aaa may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the
parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of
individual claims. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or
by calling 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a conflict between the aaa rules and
the rules set forth in these terms, the rules set forth in these terms shall
govern. [CLS] [SEP] you may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available
to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the limitation
of liability set forth in section 19 of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] all disputes shall be
resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator is bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator, and not any federal, state
or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all
disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of these terms, including, but not limited to, any
claim that all or any part of these terms is void or voidable. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,
including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of
the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or
counterclaim. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the
arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or
cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent
infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark
infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “disputes”
as stated above. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief
would be available in a court under law or in equity. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s award
shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court
of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by
telephone. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in
a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal
place of business if you are a small business), or in maricopa county,
arizona, at your option. [CLS] [SEP]

(g) _initiation of arbitration proceeding._ if either you or godaddy decide to
arbitrate a dispute, we agree to the following procedure:

i. [CLS] [SEP] write a demand for arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the demand must include a description of
the dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. [CLS] [SEP] you can find a
copy of a demand for arbitration at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/)
(“demand for arbitration: consumer arbitration rules”). [CLS] [SEP]

ii. [CLS] [SEP] send one copy of the demand for arbitration to aaa by mail at american
arbitration association case filing services 1101 laurel oak road, suite 100
voorhees, nj 08043. [CLS] [SEP]

iii. [CLS] [SEP] send one copy of the demand for arbitration to the other party at the
same address as the dispute notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. [CLS] [SEP]

(h) _hearing format._ in all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a
written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which
an award, if any, is based. [CLS] [SEP] during the arbitration, the amount of any
settlement offer made by godaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the
arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which
you or godaddy is entitled. [CLS] [SEP] the discovery or exchange of non-privileged
information relevant to the dispute may be allowed during the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

(i) _arbitration fees and payments._

i. [CLS] [SEP] disputes involving $75,000.00 or less. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy will promptly reimburse your
filing fees and pay the aaa’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. [CLS] [SEP] if you
reject godaddy’s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was
appointed (“godaddy’s last written offer”), your dispute goes all the way to
an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you
more than godaddy’s last written offer, godaddy will: (i) pay the greater of
the award or $1,000.00; (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if
any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and
costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and
pursuing your claim in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will determine the amount
of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and godaddy agree on them. [CLS] [SEP]

ii. [CLS] [SEP] disputes involving more than $75,000.00. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules will govern payment
of filing fees and the aaa’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. [CLS] [SEP]

iii. [CLS] [SEP] disputes involving any amount. [CLS] [SEP] in any arbitration you commence, godaddy
will seek its aaa or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it
reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought
for an improper purpose. [CLS] [SEP] in any arbitration godaddy commences, godaddy will
pay all filing, aaa, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy will not seek
its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] fees and expenses
are not included in determining the amount in dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

(j) _claims or disputes must be filed within one year._ to the extent
permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this section applies must be
filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the one-year period
begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed. [CLS] [SEP] if not filed
within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]

(k) _30-day opt-out period._ if you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration
provision in this disputes section, you must notify godaddy by e-mailing
legaloptout@godaddy.com within 30 days of the date that you accept these terms
(unless a longer period is required by applicable law). [CLS] [SEP] in the e-mail, you
must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number,
and (e) account number(s) and state the following: “i wish to opt out of the
arbitration provision contained in godaddy’s universal terms of service
agreement.” by providing your information in the method above, you are opting
out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in godaddy's universal terms of
service. [CLS] [SEP] your opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30)
days of first accepting the universal terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you
opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall
contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the
applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be
brought. [CLS] [SEP]

(l) _amendments to this section._ notwithstanding any provision in these terms
to the contrary, you and godaddy agree that if godaddy makes any future
amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver
provisions (other than a change to godaddy’s address) in these terms, godaddy
will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to
affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments. [CLS] [SEP] if you affirmatively opt-out of
any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
between us in accordance with the language of this section as stated in these
current terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have
consented to any such future amendments. [CLS] [SEP]

(m) _severability._ if any provision in this section is found to be
unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these
terms remaining in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing shall not apply to the
prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition
against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this
entire section shall be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] the terms of this section shall
otherwise survive any termination of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

(n) _exclusive venue for other controversies._ godaddy and you agree that any
controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action
waiver provisions in this section (other than an individual action filed in
small claims court) shall be filed only in the superior court of maricopa
county, arizona, or the united states district court for the district of
arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy. [CLS] [SEP]
you also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

**  
**23\. [CLS] [SEP] unclaimed property; dormancy charges****

  
please be advised that if a customer has an outstanding account balance (a
credit positive balance) for three (3) years or more for any reason, and (i)
godaddy is unable to issue payment to such customer or (ii) godaddy issued
payment to such customer in the form of a paper check, but the check was never
cashed, then godaddy shall turn over such account balance to the state of
arizona in accordance with state law. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that in either
case (i) or (ii) above, godaddy may withhold a dormancy charge in an amount
equal to the lesser of $25.00 or the total outstanding account balance
associated with such customer. [CLS] [SEP]

**  
**24\. [CLS] [SEP] successors and assigns****

  
this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. [CLS] [SEP]

**  
**25\. [CLS] [SEP] no third-party beneficiaries****

  
nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or
benefits. [CLS] [SEP]
