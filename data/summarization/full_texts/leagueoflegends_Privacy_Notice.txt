##  i. [CLS] [SEP] info we collect

**summary:** we collect info in three main ways:

  * you provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account). [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * we record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies). [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * we receive some of it from third parties (like social media companies). [CLS] [SEP]

the particular kinds of info we gather usually depend on how you interact with
us, like which riot services you use and how you do so. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

  

### a. [CLS] [SEP] info you provide

**summary:** we collect info you choose to provide or give to us in any
manner. [CLS] [SEP] you don’t have to share info when we ask you for it, but if you
decline, you might not be able to access certain riot services or take
advantage of their full functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

we collect info you enter or otherwise provide on the riot services,
including:

  * your email address, date of birth, in-game name (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] summoner name), and similar contact info (like when you [register for an account](https://signup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index));

  * your riot games account info (like your preferred game settings, key bindings, friends list, and mastery and rune pages); and
  

  * info you decide to give us (which may include info about your health) so that we can better make the riot services accessible to you by accommodating specific needs you may have, such as being deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired. [CLS] [SEP]

the riot services also offer social features like forums and chat. [CLS] [SEP] when you
use these features, the info you share is viewable by others – this means we
may collect and use the info you provide (including to enforce our [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service), such as described in
anti-cheat & fraud prevention and chat & player behavior below), and in some
cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge (for
example, if you’re chatting with another player while they stream a match). [CLS] [SEP]

when you play multiplayer games like league of legends, note that some info
will be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and
performance. [CLS] [SEP] we may record gameplay and related info (such as summoner name,
build order, and in-game actions), and replay or otherwise make it available
to other players without further notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, players can watch
each other play league of legends using [spectator
mode](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/spectator-faq), and we may use
gameplay footage to help promote the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you disclose any information relating to other people to us or to our
service providers in connection with the riot services, you represent that you
have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in
accordance with this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

### c. [CLS] [SEP] info we collect from third parties

**summary:** sometimes we obtain info from third parties to use along with the

games account, facebook may share info with us in accordance with facebook’s
privacy notice and your privacy settings on it. [CLS] [SEP] facebook also shares info with
us about your use of our official riot games and game specific fan pages on
facebook. [CLS] [SEP] we also, for example, gather advertising and analytics info from
third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the riot
services, and better manage our ad campaigns. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

we may collect info from third parties to supplement the info you provide and
the info we collect automatically for our legitimate purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for example:

  * we obtain info from third parties if you use their services in connection with the riot services (such as linking your facebook account with the riot services via the [add friends](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/faq-add-friends ) feature). [CLS] [SEP] your privacy settings on the third party’s service control what info they can share with us – it can include info like your name, profile picture, gender, age range, username, language, country, your friends and other info you have made available on the platform. [CLS] [SEP] please make sure you’re comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their posted policies, and if applicable, modifying your privacy settings directly on their service. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * we gather advertising and analytics info from third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the riot services, and better manage our ad campaigns (like by displaying more personalized ads and measuring how effective they are). [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about these companies, see analytics & interest-based ads. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * we collect info from third parties to help us identify from where you’re using the riot services (like your approximate location based on your ip address). [CLS] [SEP] this helps us, for example, process purchases (like assessing tax obligations), prevent fraud or abuse of the riot services (such as identifying suspicious transactions or activity), and customize your visit (like displaying the riot services in your local language). [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * we’ll also receive info from third-party platforms (like the apple appstore or google play) if you download the riot services (such as the [league friends](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/download-free-league-friends-mobile-app) app) on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] this might include, for example, technical details (like device ids) and the fact that you’ve downloaded one of our apps. [CLS] [SEP]

##  ii. [CLS] [SEP] how we collect info

**summary:** in addition to info you provide, we and our partners
automatically record some info about how you use and navigate the riot
services. [CLS] [SEP] we may combine this info with other info we gather from or about you
as described in this notice, including to enforce our [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service) and for analytics and
advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

  

###  a. [CLS] [SEP] cookies & related technologies

**summary:** we use our own servers and technologies like cookies to
automatically collect and store info about how you interact with the riot
services, as well as the device you use to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

“cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your
device for record-keeping and identification purposes. [CLS] [SEP] “web beacons” are
transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the
ways you interact with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on
an ad). [CLS] [SEP] similar common technologies include things like tags, scripts, local
shared objects (e.g., flash cookies), local storage (e.g., html5), and related
tools. [CLS] [SEP]

the riot services use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to
automatically collect, store, and read files on your device. [CLS] [SEP] they may be
delivered in a first-party (i.e., by riot games) or third-party (i.e., by
other companies) context. [CLS] [SEP] these tools help the riot services work and operate
more efficiently, as well as capture info about how you interact with us (see
info we collect). [CLS] [SEP]

we also use our servers in connection with these technologies to collect info
about the ways you interact with the riot services and store it in log files. [CLS] [SEP]
this may include, for example, info that your device, browser, or operating
system sends to us when you access the riot services (like device ids, ip
addresses, and hardware or software specifications) and details about how you
use your riot games account (like the particular features you use, your in-
game interactions and statistics, and other similar info). [CLS] [SEP]

we use info gathered through our servers and technologies like cookies for
several reasons based on riot games’, third parties’ or players’ legitimate
interest, including:

  * to monitor, secure, and maintain the riot services (like preventing fraud);
  

  * to enhance your browsing experience (such as allowing you to log-in to your account);
  

  * to analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);
  

  * to control the display of ads (including providing you with targeted offers);
  

  * to support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you’ve clicked on our ads or opened our emails);
  

  * to better personalize your visit and store your preferences and settings (for example, displaying content in your local language); and
  

  * to otherwise manage our relationship with players and provide the riot services under the [terms of service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service) (including help prevent toxicity and ensure a fair gaming environment, such as described in anti-cheat & fraud prevention and chat & player behavior below). [CLS] [SEP] 

you can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details
of how to manage or disable them, by reading our [cookies
policy](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/cookie-policy), and by
visiting <http://aboutcookies.org/> or consulting your browser’s privacy
features. [CLS] [SEP] some ways of managing traditional cookies may not impact the use of
other technologies, but certain browsers may offer their own tools for
removing html5. [CLS] [SEP] for additional details about managing flash cookies, click
[here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). [CLS] [SEP]
we do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that disabling technologies like cookies may prevent you from
using the full functionality of the riot services and the riot services may
not work as we intended. [CLS] [SEP]

###  b. [CLS] [SEP] analytics & interest-based ads

**summary:** we partner with third parties (like content providers, analytics
companies, and advertising networks) to help us improve the riot services and
better understand how you interact with them, as well as support our marketing
initiatives. [CLS] [SEP] these companies may collect info from you automatically in
connection with your visit. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

in addition to the technologies we place, other companies may set their own
cookies or similar tools when you visit the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] this includes
vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website
analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content (like videos from
youtube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]
we may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an
individual or aggregate basis. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, we use third-party analytics providers (like google analytics) to
help evaluate and report on use of the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] we also partner with ad
companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads
better tailored to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing
activity on the riot services and when visiting other online services). [CLS] [SEP] these
companies may set and read their own cookies and similar technologies to
gather info about your online activities across websites and services. [CLS] [SEP]

some analytics providers and ad companies offer you choices about how they
collect and use info directly on their websites. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about opting
out of google analytics, click
[here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). [CLS] [SEP] for a representative list of
third-party advertising and analytics partners that operate on the riot
services, as well as information about how to opt-out to the extent
applicable, click here. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to opt-out in some cases by
visiting <http://www.aboutads.info> or
<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>, or if you’re located in the eu
or canada,
[http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au) or
[http://youradchoices.ca/](http://www.youradchoices.ca/) respectively. [CLS] [SEP] you can
learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details of how to
manage or disable them, by reading our [cookies
policy](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

please note that opting-out of interest-based advertising won’t necessarily
entirely prevent info from being collected automatically on the riot services,
and it doesn’t mean you’ll receive fewer ads or stop them from being
displayed. [CLS] [SEP] instead, the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer
and therefore might be less relevant to your interests. [CLS] [SEP]

###  c. [CLS] [SEP] facebook fan pages

**summary:** riot games has facebook official fan pages. [CLS] [SEP] these include
official riot games and game specific fan pages. [CLS] [SEP] facebook collects data from
these pages according to its privacy policy and provides statistics and
insights to riot games to help us understand the types of actions people take
on our fan pages (“ **insights data** ”). [CLS] [SEP] facebook ireland limited (“
**facebook ireland** ”) and riot games are joint controllers for the
collection of insights data. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

you can find out more about how facebook collects insights data and what info
it shares with us

terms of how we have allocated data protection responsibilities between us
regarding insights data
[here](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum). [CLS] [SEP]

facebook ireland has agreed to take primary responsibility for the processing

insights data is being processed through a riot games facebook fan page, it’s
best to contact facebook ireland in the first instance. [CLS] [SEP] however, you can
exercise your data protection rights regarding insights data in respect of and

described in this notice (like to enforce the [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service), secure the riot
services, or if we’re required to do so by law or respond to legal process). [CLS] [SEP]
we don’t sell your information to independent third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we do share non-
contact info (like your summoner name, match history, game stats, and other
aggregate or anonymous info), including publicly via the [riot games
api](https://developer.riotgames.com). [CLS] [SEP]

if we ever stop providing riot services or certain parts of them (like if
we’re bought out or invaded by yordles), we may share your info with the
buyer. [CLS] [SEP] lastly, remember the stuff you share in social features (like chat and
forums) is public -- please be careful about how you use them!

  

**expand**

we share the info we collect with riot games-controlled subsidiaries and
affiliates that provide services to us so we can more seamlessly operate,
support, and improve the riot services (such as to facilitate account
transfers and provide player support in your local language). [CLS] [SEP] since we’re a
global company, this means your info may be transferred to or stored in
locations outside your country of residence (see international data
processing). [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about the riot games entity or, where applicable,
entities that control and are responsible for your info, see contact us below. [CLS] [SEP]

we also share info with service providers that operate on our behalf for the
purposes discussed in this notice (see iii. [CLS] [SEP] b. [CLS] [SEP] above). [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you
buy something on the riot services, we’ll share your payment-related info with
entities we’ve engaged to process payments and provide similar financial
services (like fraud prevention). [CLS] [SEP] other common examples include partners that
help us store data, send marketing emails, and provide player support
services, assist with research and analysis of our services (like research
institutions or universities), third party social media platforms or apps we
permit to link to our products or riot services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also transfer your
info in some cases to our professional advisers (who are sometimes independent
‘data controllers’) such as lawyers and accountants (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] when enforcing our
contract with you). [CLS] [SEP]

if you share info publicly through interactive features we control, such as
forums and chat, you should understand that this info becomes viewable to
others. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor your use of
them, including for purposes like enforcing our [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service) and applicable player
behavior requirements (see chat & player behavior and anti-cheat & fraud
prevention. [CLS] [SEP] to request removal of your info from forums or similar features
controlled by riot games, contact us. [CLS] [SEP]

we may disclose player info in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale,
joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any
portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any
bankruptcy or similar proceedings). [CLS] [SEP] this means your info may be one of the
assets transferred to the acquiring entity in such situations. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that your in-game name (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] summoner name) and gameplay
statistics (like your match history, item builds, and average number of kills
and deaths) are viewable to others and may be shared in-game and out-of-game
with players and other third parties. [CLS] [SEP] this includes info we share with the
league of legends developer community via the [riot games
api](https://developer.riotgames.com) so they can help contribute to the
player experience. [CLS] [SEP]

we may disclose player info in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale,
joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any
portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any
bankruptcy or similar proceedings). [CLS] [SEP] this means your info may be one of the
assets transferred to the acquiring entity in such situations, according to
riot games’ legitimate interest in engaging in such transactions and operating
and expanding our business. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also use, disclose, and preserve info to:

  * comply with applicable law or respond to legal process (like requests from law enforcement or other public or government authorities), including based upon our legitimate interest in doing so; 
  

  * securely operate the riot services (like stopping attacks on our systems), based on riot games’, players’ and third parties’ legitimate interest in the riot services being a safe and secure environment;

###  d. [CLS] [SEP] chat & player behavior

we’ve empowered our players to help police compliance with our policies
(including, for example, our [summoner codes of
conduct](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code)) related
to certain in-game behavior. [CLS] [SEP] for example, players may report each other and
submit descriptions of their in-game activity and actions to help us determine
if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that
apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as
temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions). [CLS] [SEP]

we also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to
monitor, chat and similar details about in-game interactions for a period we
determine is appropriate to help us, among other things, detect and prevent
toxicity, enforce our rules and policies and terms of services, and foster a
more positive gaming community for our players. [CLS] [SEP] we engage in these activities
to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal
obligation (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] to keep the riot services safe and secure), and/or because we
have a legitimate interest (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] understanding how the riot services are used,
keep them secure and improve them). [CLS] [SEP]

we use both manual (like enabling you to report such behaviour through player
support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning) tools and techniques
to support these efforts. [CLS] [SEP]

to enable us to monitor compliance with our policies, we develop template
patterns of inappropriate behaviour (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] verbal abuse, hate speech, cheating,
offensive or inappropriate name calling), which we consider indicative of
prohibited behaviours. [CLS] [SEP] we do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviours
on the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] we grade these patterns of inappropriate behaviour based
upon their severity with different consequences (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] temporary or permanent
account restrictions or chat restrictions) for players based upon how serious
their conduct is. [CLS] [SEP] if another player makes a complaint about your behaviour,
our automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behaviour and grading
system to compare your behaviour over time with these patterns of
inappropriate behaviour and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behaviour,
make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behaviour. [CLS] [SEP] this
primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the riot services,
detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive
integrity of our games. [CLS] [SEP]

our complaints procedure allow you to appeal a decision. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, we will
provide you a report showing the thought process and method behind the
decision along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behaviour in the
future. [CLS] [SEP] if you are still unhappy, you can request one of our agents to review
your case who will make a final determination as to the correct outcome
manually, based on the available evidence. [CLS] [SEP]

please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player
behavior (including our [terms of service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-
of-service)), and always be careful what you share in chat!

###  e. [CLS] [SEP] anti-cheat & fraud prevention

we always seek to offer players a fair, fun, and competitive gaming experience
on the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] our [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service) strictly prohibit use
of unauthorized third-party programs that interact with the riot services,
including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers, and automation
programs. [CLS] [SEP] when you create or use a riot games account, purchase things from
us, play our games, or otherwise interact with the riot services, we may use
anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies that may make automated decisions
(such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions)
based on the info we collect from or about you (see info we collect). [CLS] [SEP] we
engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to
comply with a legal obligation (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] to keep the riot services secure), and/or
because we have a legitimate interest (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] understanding how the riot
services are used, keep them secure and improve them). [CLS] [SEP]

to enable us to monitor compliance with our anti-cheat and fraud prevention
policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behaviour (e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
cheating, fraud), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviours. [CLS] [SEP] we do
this based upon an analysis of actual behaviours on the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] we
grade these patterns of inappropriate behaviour based upon their severity with
different consequences (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] temporary or permanent account restrictions or
chat restrictions) for players based upon how serious their conduct is. [CLS] [SEP] our
automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behaviour and grading
system to compare your behaviour over time with these patterns of
inappropriate behaviour and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behaviour,
make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behaviour. [CLS] [SEP] this
primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the riot services,
detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive
integrity of our games. [CLS] [SEP]

our complaints procedure allow you to appeal a decision. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, we will
provide you a report showing the thought process and method behind the
decision along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behaviour in the
future. [CLS] [SEP] if you are still unhappy, you can request one of our agents to review
your case who will make a final determination as to the correct outcome
manually, based on the available evidence. [CLS] [SEP]

##  vi. [CLS] [SEP] your rights, choices and controls

**summary:** you have choices regarding your use of the riot services and the
ways we process info. [CLS] [SEP] since you can interact with us in many different ways,
the particular controls available to you often depend on the nature of our
relationship. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

you can use many parts of the riot services without ever creating an account,
purchasing our products or services, or otherwise submitting info like your
name or email address to us. [CLS] [SEP] if you do choose to visit or use the riot
services, we generally retain the related personal information as long as your
account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the riot services,
operate our business (including for legitimate purposes like complying with
our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud,
resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice
and the [terms of service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service) or
to achieve the purposes set out in this notice, unless a longer retention
period is permitted or required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

the precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending
on the nature of the information, why we need it and relevant legal or
operational retention needs. [CLS] [SEP] factors we consider in determining these periods
include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended
as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to
a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been
aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the
retention period applicable for your personal data needed to provide the riot
service to you (such as accessing the games) is limited to your account life. [CLS] [SEP]
when your account is deleted, riot will delete the relevant information for
that purpose (providing the service to you) but will keep some personal
information (summoner name for instance) for other defined purposes such as
security and fraud detection. [CLS] [SEP] as another example, chat logs/history data is
retained for a period of two years from its creation. [CLS] [SEP] this is to enable riot
to properly investigate infringements of our rules and policies such as fraud,
toxicity, cheating and harmful behaviour. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also limit the info you share with third parties, such as by choosing
not to link your riot games account with third-party services (see third-party
websites and services). [CLS] [SEP]

we offer players choices about the types of communications they receive from
riot games. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to receive marketing and promotional emails from us
but later change your mind, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions
in the relevant email. [CLS] [SEP] these choices don’t apply to mandatory communications
that are part of the riot services, like important account-related notices. [CLS] [SEP]

the riot services also have many built-in tools to help players exercise
control over their info directly. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can generally delete old
forum posts, mute or disable voice chat functionality, and change other
preferences from your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] if you need help with any of these
options, be sure to contact us. [CLS] [SEP]

many internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies. [CLS] [SEP] you
may also be able to manage other similar technologies, like html5, by changing
your browser settings (see info we collect automatically). [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t want to take advantage of the services that third-party analytics
and advertising companies provide on the riot services, you may be able to
opt-out of some of them by visitin <http://www.aboutads.info> or
<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>, or if you’re located in the eu
or canada, <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> or <http://youradchoices.ca/>
respectively, or if you’re located in australia,

party advertising and analytics partners that operate on the riot services, as
well as details about how to opt-out to the extent applicable, click here. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your info, or if you would
like to request to access, correct, update, restrict or delete your personal
info, object to or opt out of the processing of your personal info, withdraw
your consent to our use of your info, or if you would like to request a copy
of your personal info for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to
the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), please contact
us or visit [privacy.riotgames.com](https://www.riotgames.com/en/privacy-
notice) and follow the instructions provided. [CLS] [SEP] your right to object includes
where we process your info for direct marketing, for performing a task in the
public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third
party. [CLS] [SEP] you can also learn more about how to request access to your account
info [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360001299888-requesting-your-account-data), or about how to delete
your account [here](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-
us/articles/202647784-account-deletion-faq). [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california resident,
you also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of
these rights. [CLS] [SEP]

if you withdraw your consent (including for marketing purposes), it does not
affect the lawfulness of what we did up until that point. [CLS] [SEP]

before we process such requests, we may ask you to verify your identity (like
by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain info to help us
confirm ownership) and we may request payment where allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP] note that
asking us to remove personal info or refrain from processing it may also
result in account suspension or termination where this info is necessary to
make riot services available to you (we normally tell you this at the point we
collect the info), in which case you’ll no longer be able to access those riot
services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also retain certain info associated with your account for
purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books
and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts
and terms, such as this notice and the [terms of
service](https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service). [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re in the eea/uk, you may lodge a complaint with an eu/uk/eea data
protection authority for your country or region where an alleged infringement
of applicable data protection law occurs. [CLS] [SEP] riot games lead supervisory
authority under the gdpr is the irish data protection commission (see

##  vii. [CLS] [SEP] security

**summary:** we’re committed to securing player info and complying with our
obligations towards applicable data protection laws, but can’t absolutely
guarantee the security of any data we collect from you. [CLS] [SEP] by choosing to share
info with us (or anybody else online these days), you’re acknowledging this
risk. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

we use appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security safeguards
to help protect your info from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure both
during transmission and in storage. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use computer systems with
limited access in controlled facilities to store info. [CLS] [SEP] we also use
technologies like encryption and hashing to protect some of the info we
collect. [CLS] [SEP]

however, please note that no server, communications network, or data
transmission over the internet is 100% secure. [CLS] [SEP] the riot services are no
exception. [CLS] [SEP] we can’t guarantee the security of any info transmitted through the
riot services and make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such
loss or misuse. [CLS] [SEP]

it’s up to you whether you’d like to share info with us; if you do, you’re
acknowledging that you’re doing so with this risk. [CLS] [SEP]

##  viii. [CLS] [SEP] updates and revisions

**summary:** we’ll make changes to this policy over time to keep you better
informed about how we handle player info. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**expand**

we’ll update our privacy notice from time to time to reflect changes in
technology, law, our business operations, or any other reason we determine is
necessary or appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] when we do make changes, we’ll update the “last
modified” date at the top of the notice and post it to the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] if
we make material changes to the notice or the ways we process player info,
we’ll provide you additional notice as well (such as by prominently posting a
notice of the changes on the riot services before they take effect or sending
you a notification directly). [CLS] [SEP]

we encourage you to check back periodically to review this notice for any
changes since your last visit. [CLS] [SEP] this will help ensure you better understand
your relationship with riot games, including the ways we process your info. [CLS] [SEP]
