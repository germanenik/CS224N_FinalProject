marketing, and to improve and adjust user experiences. [CLS] [SEP] to find out more about
“cookies”, other similar technologies and the options available to manage

**cookies and other similar technologies**

we use cookies and other similar technologies on our website, products and
services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer that
hold information that a website can read. [CLS] [SEP] for example, cookies can be used to
authenticate your visit and prevent you from having to log in every time you
visit the website. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect both personal and non-personal information from you when you use
our websites, products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on how we deal with
your information, please see our [privacy policy](/en-gb/terms/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

we and our partners also use other technologies, including data stored on your
web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other
software for similar purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in this policy, we refer to “cookies” and other
similar technologies as “cookies.” these technologies can be used to recognise
your device as it interacts with our services. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we can recognise
when you visit pages on our or others’ sites, use parts of an app or when you
open emails we send you. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies include the following:

  * ****pixel tags:**** pixel tags are small blocks of code we install on our webpages, emails or advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] these are used to relay information about how you interact with our services and may contain information about your device and browser. [CLS] [SEP] for example, information about your device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, ip address, whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an advertisement. [CLS] [SEP] pixels also provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ****local storage:**** where other types of cookies cannot be used, local storage allows us to store additional data to help improve your experience while using our services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ****ip address:**** every device that is connected to the internet has an internet protocol address. [CLS] [SEP] when you interact with our services, we and our partners use your ip address for security purposes, for example, to prevent fraud. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use your ip address to identify your location and display content that is more appropriate to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ****device identifiers:**** we may also create or collect a unique device identifier so we can understand how you use your devices to access our services. [CLS] [SEP]
