fees, are $5,000.00 or less (âsmall claimâ), the arbitrator may, if you
prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs as
part of any award, but may not grant us our attorney fees, expert witness fees
or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. [CLS] [SEP] in a
small claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than half of the total
administrative, facility and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of such fees,
whichever is less, and we shall pay the remainder of such fees. [CLS] [SEP]
administrative, facility and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your
total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees,
exceed $5,000.00 (âlarge claimâ) shall be determined according to aaa
rules. [CLS] [SEP] in a large claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing
party, or apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert
witness fees and costs to the extent allowed by the applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] judgement
may be entered on the arbitratorâs award in any court of competent
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

  

you may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to
us. [CLS] [SEP] to opt out, you must send notice by email to optout@sea.samsung.com, with
the subject line: âarbitration opt outâwebsite terms of use.â your opt-
out email must include: (a) your name and address; (b) e-mail address; and (c)

that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary,
and the remaining provisions of these terms will remain in full force and
effect. [CLS] [SEP] you may be subject to additional terms and conditions that govern your
use of third-party services, content, or software. [CLS] [SEP]

  
  

# no waiver
