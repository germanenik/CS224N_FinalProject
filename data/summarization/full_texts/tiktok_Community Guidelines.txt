##  **introduction**

 _last updated, december 2020_

tiktok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. [CLS] [SEP] we are building a
global community where people can create and share, discover the world around
them, and connect with others across the globe. [CLS] [SEP] as we grow, we are committed
to maintaining a supportive environment for our community. [CLS] [SEP] our community
guidelines define a set of norms and common code of conduct for tiktok; they
provide guidance on what is and is not allowed to make a welcoming space for
everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

at tiktok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. [CLS] [SEP] we
encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage
in what inspires them; and we believe that a safe environment helps everyone
express themselves openly. [CLS] [SEP] we deeply value the global nature of our community,
and we strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we
operate. [CLS] [SEP] we also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by
only allowing authentic content on tiktok. [CLS] [SEP]

our community guidelines apply to everyone and to everything on tiktok. [CLS] [SEP] we
proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation before
content gets reported to us. [CLS] [SEP] we also encourage our community members to use
the [tools we provide on tiktok ](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-
hc/report-a-problem)to report any content they believe violates our community
guidelines. [CLS] [SEP]

we will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images,
comments, and text – that violates our community guidelines. [CLS] [SEP] individuals are
notified of our decisions and can appeal if they believe no violation has
occurred. [CLS] [SEP] we will suspend or ban accounts and/or devices that are involved in
severe or repeated violations; we will consider information available on other
platforms and offline in these decisions. [CLS] [SEP] when warranted, we will report the
accounts to relevant legal authorities. [CLS] [SEP]

our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. [CLS] [SEP] for some content –
such as spam, videos under review, or videos that could be considered
upsetting or depict things that may be shocking to a general audience – we may
reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results or limiting
distribution in the for you feed. [CLS] [SEP]

we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our
community guidelines could be in the public interest. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, we may allow
exceptions under certain circumstances, such as educational, documentary,
scientific, or artistic content, satirical content, content in fictional
settings, counterspeech, and content in the public interest that is newsworthy
or otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. [CLS] [SEP]

in consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our community guidelines
from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our
commitment to keeping tiktok a safe place for creativity and joy. [CLS] [SEP]

  

##  **violent extremism**

we take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off tiktok. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote
dangerous individuals or organizations. [CLS] [SEP] when there is a threat to public
safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we
may suspend or ban the account. [CLS] [SEP] when warranted, we will report threats to
relevant legal authorities. [CLS] [SEP] to effectively protect our community, we may
consider information available on other platforms and offline to identify
violent and extremist individuals and organizations on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] if we
find such individuals or organizations on tiktok, we will close their
accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

### threats and incitement to violence

we consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or
encouraging other people to commit violence. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow threats of

violence or hatred, dehumanize individuals or groups, or embrace a hateful
ideology. [CLS] [SEP]

criminal organizations

criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have
engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape,
