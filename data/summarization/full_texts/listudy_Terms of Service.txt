# terms of service

translated terms of service shall only serve as an informal source of
information. [CLS] [SEP] please read the english version for the official version
applicable to the site. [CLS] [SEP] [english version of the terms of service](/en/terms-
of-service)

this page explains our terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] when you use listudy, you’re agreeing to
all the rules on this page. [CLS] [SEP] some of them need to be expressed in specific
legal language but we’ve done our best to offer you clear and simple
explanations of what everything means. [CLS] [SEP]

by using this website (the “site”) and services (together with the site, the
“services”) offered by listudy.org (together with our subsidiaries,
affiliates, representatives, and directors – collectively “listudy”, “we”, or
“us”) you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “terms”). [CLS] [SEP] you’re
also agreeing to our privacy policy and cookie policy, and agreeing to follow
any other rules on the site. [CLS] [SEP]

we may change these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we do, we’ll let you know
about any significant or material changes, by notifying you on the site. [CLS] [SEP] new
versions of the terms will never apply retroactively – we’ll tell you the
exact date they go into effect. [CLS] [SEP] if you continue using listudy after a change,
that means you accept the new terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## creating an account

to sign up for a listudy account, you need to be 16 or over. [CLS] [SEP] you’re
responsible for your account and all the activity on it. [CLS] [SEP]

you can browse listudy and use some of our services without registering an
account. [CLS] [SEP] but to use all of listudy’ functions, you’ll need to register. [CLS] [SEP] this
is done by choosing a username, setting a password, and securing it with an
email address. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t submit accurate information, you might not be able
to access your account. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose any email (even fictitious ones). [CLS] [SEP] just
make sure to remember the email, because it is used to log in. [CLS] [SEP]

don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that
violate anyone’s rights. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t follow these rules, we reserve the right
to close your account without warning. [CLS] [SEP]

when these terms discuss “users” or a “user”, we’ll be referring to both
registered and unregistered users, unless it relates to features, information
or data an unregistered user does not or cannot have access to. [CLS] [SEP]

## user rights

both registered and unregistered users have rights to protect their property,
privacy, and identity unless they have consented or agree to making their
identity public. [CLS] [SEP] most information on this topic can be found in our privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

listudy believes that users should have their public information, identity,
and data protected as strongly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] we use european union data
protection law as our baseline, and in many respects go further than what the
law requires. [CLS] [SEP] we’ve also chosen to extend these rights to all users, not just
those under a european union jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

by agreeing to these terms, registered users can have access to all of
listudy’ features and are free to use them for their own personal,
educational, charitable, or developmental purposes. [CLS] [SEP] listudy itself is also
free/libre open-source software licensed under the gnu agpl. [CLS] [SEP] this doesn’t
prevent listudy from having the ultimate decision in what kind of use of the
services is appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

users are responsible for the content they post. [CLS] [SEP] some examples of content
would include information, data, text, and pgn files. [CLS] [SEP] we won’t be responsible
for the content you post. [CLS] [SEP]

in all circumstances, we may retain certain information as required by law or
necessary for our legitimate operating purposes. [CLS] [SEP] all of the provisions within
this agreement survive the termination of an account. [CLS] [SEP]

## closing and terminating your account

you can close your account at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

you can terminate your account at any time by contacting the listudy
administrators. [CLS] [SEP] this will permanently erase your account and all content and
data. [CLS] [SEP] although we may retain certain information as required by law or as
necessary for our legitimate operating purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## our rights

to operate, we need to be able to maintain control over what happens on our
website. [CLS] [SEP] to summarise, we reserve the right to make decisions to protect the
health and integrity of our systems. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll only use these powers when we
absolutely must. [CLS] [SEP]

we can make changes to the listudy site and services without letting you know
in advance, or being liable for any loss, damage, or harm that arises as a
result. [CLS] [SEP]

we have the ultimate say in who can use our site and services. [CLS] [SEP] we can cancel
accounts, or decline to let users use our services. [CLS] [SEP]

we are not responsible for any loss, damage, or harm that may arise from any
occasional downtime. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to contact the relevant authorities if a user is breaking
the law, and share relevant data with the authorities, if harm or damage
occurs either against our users or against the operation of our
infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP]

this list is non-exhaustive, and we reserve the right to add, edit, or remove
entries from it at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

## privacy

our privacy policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us
when you use our services. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that through your use of the
services you consent to the collection and use, as set out in the privacy
policy, of this information. [CLS] [SEP] listudy currently follows european data
protection, and applies these rights to users of all nationalities, not just
european users. [CLS] [SEP]

## copyright

listudy is licensed under the gnu agpl license. [CLS] [SEP]

listudy respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users
of the services to do the same. [CLS] [SEP] listudy reserves the right to remove content
alleged to be infringing without prior notice at our sole discretion and
without liability to you. [CLS] [SEP] we will respond to notices of alleged copyright
infringement, that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us,
as described in our copyright policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe your content has been copied in a way that constitutes
copyright infringement please alert us by contacting us at
copyright@listudy.org. [CLS] [SEP]

you retain your rights to any content you submit, post or create through the
services including chess games. [CLS] [SEP] by submitting, posting or displaying content
on or through our services, you grant us a global, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, reproduce, process,
adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such content in any
and all media or distribution channels. [CLS] [SEP] such additional uses may be made
without compensation paid to you with respect to the content you make
available through the services. [CLS] [SEP] this does not remove your rights from other
3rd party sites, such as twitch or youtube. [CLS] [SEP]

## stuff we’re not responsible for

services made available are on an as is and as available basis. [CLS] [SEP] we’re not
responsible for whether this stuff actually works, though if it does that’s an
added bonus to all of us. [CLS] [SEP]

listudy makes no warranty or representation and disclaims all responsibility
and liability for the completeness, availability, timeliness, accuracy and
security of the content and services. [CLS] [SEP]

we disclaim all responsibility for any harm or loss of any data to your
computer system, the deletion of or failure to store or transmit
communications or content maintained by the services or whether the services
will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure or
error-free basis. [CLS] [SEP] listudy cannot be held responsible for any loss, financial
or otherwise, from third party sources, including misrepresentations,
negligence or fraud. [CLS] [SEP]

no advice, information or written correspondence whether oral or written
procured from listudy entities or through listudy services will create any
warranty or representation not expressly made herein. [CLS] [SEP]
