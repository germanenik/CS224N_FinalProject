**26. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution**

26.1 before filing a claim against pwe, you agree to try to resolve the
dispute informally by sending a notice of dispute via email to
legal@perfectworld.com with the subject line of "attn: legal". [CLS] [SEP]



26.2 the notice must include your name, mailing address, and phone number (if
any), and must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, as well
as set forth the specific relief sought. [CLS] [SEP] if a dispute is not resolved within
one month  after we receive your notice, either you or we may bring a formal
arbitration proceeding in accordance with the jams international arbitration
rules ("jams"). [CLS] [SEP]



**27. [CLS] [SEP] agreement to arbitrate**

27.1 arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] please read the following sections carefully, as they affect
your rights. [CLS] [SEP] you and pwe agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms
or the service through final and binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to
arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and includes claims based in
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge that these terms evidence a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and thus the united states arbitration act shall govern the
interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the arbitration
clause in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

27.2 opting-out of arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you may opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate
by providing pwe written notice within thirty (30) days of first accepting
these terms. [CLS] [SEP] your notice must include: (i) your full name (first and last);
(ii) the email address you used to register your account; and (iii) a clear
statement that you decline this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] email your opt-out
notice via email to: legal@perfectworld.com with the subject line: "attn:
legal"



27.3 costs of arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] pwe will pay all jams filing, administration, and
arbitrator fees for any arbitration we initiate. [CLS] [SEP] you will pay the fees for any
arbitration you initiate, in accordance with the jams rules. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you
initiate an arbitration after attempting to informally resolve a dispute in
accordance with these terms, and are seeking relief valued at $300 or less
(both to you and us), pwe will pay all jams filing, administration, and
arbitrator fees. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim is for greater than $300 but less than $10,000,
pwe will pay all such fees in excess of $20. [CLS] [SEP] after pwe receives notice at the
email address above that you have commenced such an arbitration, pwe shall
promptly reimburse you for any portion of the filing fee you have paid that
pwe has agreed to pay. [CLS] [SEP]



27.4 frivolous claims. [CLS] [SEP] if the arbitrator determines that either the substance
of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper
purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the federal rule of civil
procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all jams filing, administration, and
arbitrator fees shall be governed by the jams rules and you agree to reimburse
us for any amount we have paid on your behalf to the jams. [CLS] [SEP] pwe shall not seek
its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or
brought for an improper purpose. [CLS] [SEP]



27.5 arbitration procedures. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that one arbitrator from the jams will
arbitrate the dispute under the jams international arbitration rules, as
modified by this arbitration provision. [CLS] [SEP] the award of the arbitrator shall be
accompanied by a reasoned opinion. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be held in the united
states county where you live or work, or any other location that we mutually
agree to. [CLS] [SEP]



27.6 no class actions. [CLS] [SEP] you may only resolve disputes with us on an individual
basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class,
consolidated, or representative action. [CLS] [SEP] you may not bring a claim as part of a
class arbitration, class action, private attorney general action, or
consolidation with other arbitrations. [CLS] [SEP]



27.7 judicial forum. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that this agreement to arbitrate is found
not to apply to you or your claim, you and pwe agree that any judicial
proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or
state courts of san mateo county, california. [CLS] [SEP] both you and pwe consent to
venue and personal jurisdiction there, and waive any objection as to
inconvenient forum. [CLS] [SEP]



27.8 time limitation to bring claims. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding any statute or law to
the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these
terms or your use of the service must be filed within one (1) year after such
claim or cause of action arose, otherwise that claim or cause of action will
be barred forever. [CLS] [SEP]



27.9 future changes to agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding any provision
in these terms to the contrary, you agree that if pwe makes any future change
to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice email address
above, website links, or telephone numbers listed in this provision), any such
changes will not affect disputes that arose before the effective date of the
change. [CLS] [SEP]



**28. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability**

28.1 in no event shall we, pwe, its directors, members, affiliates,
subsidiaries, employees or agents be liable for any direct, special, indirect
or consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind, including but not
limited to loss of use, loss of profits or loss of data, whether in an action
in contract, tort (including but not limited to negligence) or otherwise,
arising out of or in any way connected with the use of or inability to use the
website, the service, the games or any of the content or the materials
contained in or accessed through the website or the service, including without
limitation any damages cased by or resulting from reliance by user on any
information obtained from us or pwe, or that result from mistakes, omissions,
interruptions, deletion of files or email, errors, defects, viruses, delays in
operation or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not
resulting from acts of god, communications failure, theft, destruction or
unauthorized access to pwe's records, programs or services. [CLS] [SEP]



28.2 in no event shall the aggregate liability of pwe, whether in contract,
warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed),
product liability, strict liability or other theory, arising out of or
relating to the use of or inability to use the service, the website or any of
the games exceed any compensation you pay, if any, to pwe for access to or use
thereof. [CLS] [SEP]



28.3 some member states in the eu do not allow the foregoing limitations of
liability by (mandatory) law, so they may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] in such case you
explicitly agree that our (or any such other released parties) liability to
you shall be limited to the   maximum extent permitted by applicable mandatory
law. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we cannot be held responsible or liable for anything that
occurs or results from accessing or subscribing to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

agreement or your rights hereunder, or the games or any other software
provided by us, and any attempt to the contrary is void. [CLS] [SEP]

reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this
agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
remaining provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

limitations, stated herein, are necessary and reasonable in order to protect
pwe, its business, and its licensors, and you expressly agree that monetary
damages would be inadequate to compensate pwe fully for any breach of this

agree and knowledge that any such violation or threatened violation will cause
irreparable injury to pwe and that, in addition  to any other remedies that
may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, pwe shall be entitled to
obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of this
