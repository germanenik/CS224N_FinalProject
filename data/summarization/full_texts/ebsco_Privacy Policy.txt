you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in
accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] non-personal information:** ebsco information services collects
information that does not directly reveal your identity or does not directly
relate to an identifiable individual. [CLS] [SEP] this may include a unique identifier
(unconnected to an individual’s personal information) and related analytics
and usage information that we use to track usage of our services, track trends
in our services, administer the services, and improve our users’ experience. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] how do we collect the information?**

the categories of sources from which we collect personal information are
described in the table above. [CLS] [SEP]

we only collect and use personal information when you voluntarily provide it
to us or when an institutional customer provides it to us in connection with
its method of authenticating users for access to our services, with the
exception of your ip address, geolocation, and certain device information
which may be automatically captured when you access our services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your
personal information, we will only use that information for the specific
reason for which it was provided to us. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to use some of the unique functions within our services, a user must
first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will
require the user’s disclosure of limited personal information. [CLS] [SEP] such disclosure
is strictly voluntary. [CLS] [SEP]

because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an email
address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email. [CLS] [SEP]

we automatically collect non-personal information generated from your use of
our services. [CLS] [SEP] we use this non-personal information in the aggregate. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
combine these types of non-personal information with personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies and similar technologies:** for information about the cookies and
other tracking technologies used by our services and how to manage your
settings for these cookies and technologies, please visit our [cookie
policy](https://www.ebsco.com/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] how do we use the information?**

the business or commercial purpose(s) for which personal information is
collected is described in the table above. [CLS] [SEP]

we use the personal information we collect for the limited purposes of
processing your transactions, establishing and/or verifying a person’s or
account holder’s identity, customer service, improving and customizing our
services and their content, authorization, content processing, content
classification, and providing you with information concerning our services. [CLS] [SEP] we
will retain this information for as long as your account is active or as
needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes, and enforce our agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, our ebscohost service employs a personalization feature that
requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that feature. [CLS] [SEP]
the personalization feature of ebscohost is a powerful tool that provides
users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have
conducted. [CLS] [SEP] we believe the personalization feature is a useful tool that will
enhance the user's experience with the service, but it does require the user
to provide personal information to us. [CLS] [SEP]

we use the non-personal information we collect to administer the services,
improve access to the services, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific
usage statistics, protect the services and their content from inappropriate
use, and improve the user's experience. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use the personal information and non-personal information we collect by
sharing it with third-party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content
providers of ebsco information services (collectively, "service providers")
for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, providing
access to our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining
support services for our businesses. [CLS] [SEP] we are not in the business of selling
personal information to third-parties or service providers and will share it
with service providers only as we describe in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] in
situations where we share personal information with service providers, we
ensure access is granted to the service providers only upon the condition that
the personal information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying
out the services these service providers are performing for ebsco information
services. [CLS] [SEP] as part of making the determination whether we will share personal
information with service providers, we will obtain assurances that they will
appropriately protect and maintain the confidentiality of personal information
consistent with this privacy policy and as required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

the personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, and
processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. [CLS] [SEP] these
countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of
your country. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, the servers we use to provide our services are
located in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] this means that when we collect your personal
information, we may process it in the united states or the country where you
live. [CLS] [SEP] however, when we process your personal information, irrelevant of its
processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to
ensure that your personal information remains protected in accordance with
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your usage data related to our services with our affiliates and
certain service providers for purposes of providing or improving our services. [CLS] [SEP]
we will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our
services to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to provide our
services, enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement between
us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are provided
access to our services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our contractual
obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as
required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

we also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we are
required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the
information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to the
extent permitted by applicable local law, to respond to claims, or to protect
or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our
employees, customers, or the public. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not use your personal information for automated-decision making. [CLS] [SEP]

in the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of ebsco
information services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired,
customer information, which may include personal information, may be one of
the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which
case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such
customer information. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] what is our legal basis for collecting and using personal information?**

our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described
above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific
context in which we collect it. [CLS] [SEP]

however, we will normally collect personal information from you only:

  * where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you or your organization;
  * where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or
  * where we have your consent to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect
your vital interests or those of another person. [CLS] [SEP]

if we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
requirement or to provide the services or a feature of the services pursuant
to a contract with your institution, we will make this clear at the relevant
time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is
mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your
personal information). [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our
legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you
at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal
basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us
using the contact information provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] how do we secure personal information?**

ebsco information services has taken appropriate technical and organizational
measures to ensure that personal information we have collected or will collect
in the future is secure. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we have limited the number of people who
have access to personal information, by electronic security systems and
authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access. [CLS] [SEP]

as a reminder, ebsco information services provides links to third-party
websites. [CLS] [SEP] these websites may not have the same privacy policies as ebsco
information services. [CLS] [SEP] we take reasonable care in recommending these websites,
but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] we urge
users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our
services and linking to a third-party website. [CLS] [SEP]

we always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving
consumer data we receive. [CLS] [SEP] we have appropriate security measures in place in
our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of
information that we have collected from you in connection with our services. [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] what are my rights?**

depending on your country or state of residency, you may have legal rights
with respect to your personal information, including one or more of the
following (each of which may be subject to certain exceptions that will be

attn: data privacy officer, legal department

  4. [CLS] [SEP] _via email:_ [privacy@ebsco.com](mailto:privacy@ebsco.com)

_verification of requests_

all requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person making
the request (the “requstor”) is the individual about whom we have collected
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the method we use to verify the requestor’s identity may
vary based on the type of customer or user, the services used, and the type of
personal information we have collected. [CLS] [SEP] in most cases, we will require the
requestor to provide the following information when submitting a request:

  * type of customer or user
  * first name
  * last name
  * email address
  * country
  * state
  * legal relationship to the subject of the request

we will use this identifying information to communicate with the requestor and
receive confirmation that they submitted the request, and then match this
identifying information with the personal information we already maintain. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also use the contact information that we already maintain to communicate
with the individual to confirm that they submitted the request. [CLS] [SEP] in rare cases,
we may ask for additional information to verify the request, which may include
a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the
individual whose personal information is the subject of the request. [CLS] [SEP]

if the requestor submits a request to delete personal information, we will
separately confirm that the individual wants their personal information
deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

we may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the requestor to a
reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty
(depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal
information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a unauthorized
request) or, in the case of a request to delete personal information, we may
deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the individual
wants their personal information deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

_authorized agent_

if you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will require that you:

  * provide the authorized agent written permission to act as your authorized agent; and
  * verify the authorized agent’s identity directly with us. [CLS] [SEP]

the above authorized agent requirements do not apply if you have provided the
authorized agent with legally binding power of attorney in accordance with
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

we may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have
been authorized by you to act on their behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

**h. [CLS] [SEP] what choices do i have?**

we understand that you may not want to allow our disclosure of your personal
information to our service providers, or to let us use that information for
purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which it
originally was collected or that you later may authorize. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you may
contact us to inform us that you do not want to permit these uses of your
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] to do so, please contact us using the contact
information provided above. [CLS] [SEP]

it is important to us that the personal information we collect is appropriate
and relevant to the purposes for which we intend to use it. [CLS] [SEP] we will use
personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for
which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the person providing the
information. [CLS] [SEP] ebsco information services will take reasonable steps to ensure
that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete,
and current. [CLS] [SEP]

you may sign-up to receive email newsletters or other marketing materials from
us. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may
immediately update your email preferences free of cost by using the
“unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you or through your account
settings within the services or by submitting a request using any of the
methods provided above. [CLS] [SEP]

**i. [CLS] [SEP] collection and use of information from children: information for
parents**

most of our services are not directed toward children. [CLS] [SEP] for our services that
are designed to be used by children under 16 years of age, we comply with the
provisions of the children's on-line privacy protection act ("coppa") and

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] non-personal information:** ebsco information services collects

(unconnected to an individual’s personal information) and related analytics
and usage information that we use to track usage of our websites, track trends
in our websites, administer the websites, and improve our users’ experience. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] how do we collect the information?**

the categories of sources from which we collect personal information are
described in the table above. [CLS] [SEP]

we only collect and use personal information when you voluntarily provide it
to us, with the exception of your ip address, geolocation, and certain device
information which may be automatically captured when you access our websites. [CLS] [SEP]

under limited circumstances, we also collect limited business contact
information from legitimate third parties (for example, third parties that
provide attendee lists or business prospect lists). [CLS] [SEP] this helps us to update or
expand our records. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide us personal information about others, or if
others give us your personal information, we will only use that information
for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. [CLS] [SEP] examples of the types
of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased
from third parties and combined with information we already have about you,
may include name, email address, job title, and company/institution
affiliation. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to use some portions of our websites, a user must first complete a
registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require the user’s
disclosure of limited personal information. [CLS] [SEP] such disclosure is strictly
voluntary. [CLS] [SEP]

because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an email
address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email. [CLS] [SEP]

we automatically collect non-personal information generated from your use of
our websites. [CLS] [SEP] we use this non-personal information in the aggregate. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
combine these types of non-personal information with personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies and similar technologies:** for information about the cookies and
other tracking technologies used by our websites and how to manage your
settings for these cookies and technologies, please visit our [cookie
policy](https://www.ebsco.com/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

**social media features:** our websites may use social media features, such as
the facebook ‘like’ button (“social media features”). [CLS] [SEP] these features may
collect your ip address and which page you are visiting on our websites, and
may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. [CLS] [SEP] you may be given
the option by such social media features to post information about your
activities on our websites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a
third-party social media network in order to share with others within your
network. [CLS] [SEP] social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted
directly on the websites. [CLS] [SEP] your interactions with these features are governed
by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant social media
features. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] how do we use the information?**

the business or commercial purpose(s) for which personal information is
collected is described in the table above. [CLS] [SEP]

we use the personal information we collect for limited internal purposes that
may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions,
establishing and/or verifying a person’s or account holder’s identity,
customer service, improving and customizing our websites and their content,
development of products and services, content processing, content
classification, and providing you with information concerning our products and
services. [CLS] [SEP] we will retain this information for as long as it is needed for the
purposes for which it was collected, and/or to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

we use the non-personal information we collect to administer the websites,
perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect the
websites and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's
experience. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use the personal information and non-personal information we collect by
sharing it with third party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content
providers of ebsco information services (collectively, "service providers")
for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, servicing our
systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses. [CLS] [SEP] we are not in the
business of selling personal information to third parties or service providers
and will share it with service providers only as we describe in this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP] in situations where we share personal information with service
providers, we ensure access is granted to the service providers only upon the
condition that the personal information is kept confidential and is used only
for carrying out the services these service providers are performing for ebsco
information services. [CLS] [SEP] as part of making that determination whether we will
share personal information with service providers, we will obtain assurances
that they will appropriately protect and maintain the confidentiality of
personal information consistent with this privacy policy and as required by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

the personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, and
processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. [CLS] [SEP] these
countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of
your country. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, the servers we use to provide our services are
located in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] this means that when we collect your personal
information, we may process it in the united states or the country where you
live. [CLS] [SEP] however, when we process your personal information, irrelevant of its
processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to
ensure that your personal information remains protected in accordance with
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your usage data related to our websites with our affiliates and
certain service providers for purposes of providing or improving our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
we will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our
websites to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to enhance the
website experience, to enforce the terms of use, or as required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

we also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we are
required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the
information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to the
extent permitted by local law, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance
the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees,
customers, or the public. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not use your personal information for automated-decision making. [CLS] [SEP]

in the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of ebsco
information services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired,
customer information, which may include personal information, may be one of
the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which
case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such
customer information. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] what is our legal basis for collecting and using personal information?**

our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described
above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific
context in which we collect it. [CLS] [SEP]

however, we will normally collect personal information from you only:

  * where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you or your organization;
  * where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or
  * where we have your consent to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect
your vital interests or those of another person. [CLS] [SEP]

if we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
requirement or to perform a contract, we will make this clear at the relevant
time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is
mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your
personal information). [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our
legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you
at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal
basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us
using the contact information provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] how do we secure personal information?**

ebsco information services has taken appropriate technical and organizational
measures to ensure that personal information we have collected or will collect
in the future is secure. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we have limited the number of people who
have access to personal information, by electronic security systems and
authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access. [CLS] [SEP]

as a reminder, ebsco information services provides links to third-party
websites. [CLS] [SEP] these websites may not have the same privacy policies as ebsco
information services. [CLS] [SEP] we take reasonable care in recommending these websites,
but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] we urge
users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our
websites and linking to a third-party website. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving
consumer data we receive. [CLS] [SEP] we have appropriate security measures in place in
our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of
information that we have collected from you in connection with our websites. [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] what are my rights?**

_verification of requests_

all requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person making
the request (the “requstor”) is the individual about whom we have collected
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the method we use to verify the requestor’s identity may
vary based on the type of customer or user, the websites used, and the type of
personal information we have collected. [CLS] [SEP] in most cases, we will require the
requestor to provide the following information when submitting a request:

  * state
  * legal relationship to the subject of the request

we will use this identifying information to communicate with the requestor and

identifying information with the personal information we already maintain. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also use the contact information that we already maintain to communicate
with the individual to confirm that they submitted the request. [CLS] [SEP] in rare cases,
we may ask for additional information to verify the request, which may include
a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the
individual whose personal information is the subject of the request. [CLS] [SEP]

if the requestor submits a request to delete personal information, we will
separately confirm that the individual wants their personal information
deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

we may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the requestor to a
reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty
(depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal
information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a unauthorized
request) or, in the case of a request to delete personal information, we may
deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the individual
