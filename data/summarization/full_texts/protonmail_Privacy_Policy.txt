# privacy policy

_last modified: february 15, 2021_

in the following policy, protonmail refers to the service offered by proton
technologies ag (the "company" or "we") through the protonmail.com website
(the "service"). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy explains (i) what information we collect
through your access and use of our service (ii) the use we make of such
information; and (iii) the security level we provide for protecting such
information. [CLS] [SEP]

by visiting protonmail.com and using the services provided here, you agree to
the terms outlined in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## legal framework

the company is domiciled in switzerland at the following address:

proton technologies ag, route de la galaise 32, 1228 plan-les-ouates geneva,
switzerland

all data storage infrastructure is also located solely within switzerland, and
thus governed by the laws and regulations of switzerland. [CLS] [SEP] additional
information about the legal framework can be found in our [transparency
report](/blog/transparency-report/). [CLS] [SEP]

## data related to the opening of an account

any email address provided to protonmail through either our waiting list,
optional email verification, or optional notification/recovery email setting
in your account, is considered personal data as defined and protected by the
swiss federal data protection act (dpa). [CLS] [SEP]

such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about
protonmail, to send you information related to security, to send you an
invitation link to create your protonmail account, to verify your protonmail
account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also inform you about new proton products in which you might have an
interest. [CLS] [SEP] you are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those features
through the account settings panel. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to maintain the integrity of the service, protonmail must take
measures to avoid creation of accounts by spammers. [CLS] [SEP] this is because if
spammers use protonmail to send messages, protonmail’s ip addresses can become
blocked by major mail providers such as gmail, yahoo, outlook, etc. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of
accounts by spam bots or human spammers, protonmail uses a variety of human
verification methods. [CLS] [SEP] you may be asked to verify using either recaptcha,
email, or sms. [CLS] [SEP] ip addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are
saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if
you are a spammer. [CLS] [SEP] if this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a
cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by
us. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more](/support/knowledge-base/human-verification/)

## data collection

our company’s overriding policy is to collect as little user information as
possible to ensure a completely private and anonymous user experience when
using the service. [CLS] [SEP] we also have no technical means to access your encrypted
message contents. [CLS] [SEP]

service's user data collection is limited to the following:

**visiting our website:** we employ a local installation of matomo, an open
source analytics tool. [CLS] [SEP] analytics are anonymized whenever possible and stored
locally (and not on the cloud). [CLS] [SEP]

**account creation:** it is not necessary to provide personal information in
order to create an account, but you may provide an external email address for
notification or password recovery purposes. [CLS] [SEP] should you choose to provide it,
we do associate another email address with your account (for password
recovery, or notifications). [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis for processing is consent and you
are free to remove that data in the account panel of your protonmail account. [CLS] [SEP]

**account activity:** due to limitations of the smtp protocol, we have access
to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the ip
address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent
and received times. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have access to encrypted message content but
unencrypted messages sent from external providers to protonmail are scanned
for spam and viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of
our users. [CLS] [SEP] we also have access to the following records of account activity:
number of messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of
messages, last login time. [CLS] [SEP]

**communicating with protonmail:** your communications with the company, such
as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our
staff. [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to
troubleshoot more efficiently and improve the quality of the protonmail
service. [CLS] [SEP]

**ip logging:** by default, protonmail does not keep permanent ip logs. [CLS] [SEP]
however, ip logs may be kept temporarily to combat abuse and fraud, and your
ip address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that
breach our terms and conditions (spamming, ddos attacks against protonmail
infrastructure, brute force attacks, etc). [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis of this processing
is our legitimate interest to protect our service against nefarious
activities. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
your login ip address is also kept permanently (until you delete it) if you
enable authentication logging for your account (by default this is off). [CLS] [SEP] the
legal basis of this processing is consent, and you are free to opt-in or opt-
out at any time in the security panel of your protonmail account. [CLS] [SEP]

**payment information:** the company relies on third parties to process credit
card, paypal, and bitcoin transactions so the company necessarily must share
payment information with third parties. [CLS] [SEP] anonymous cash or bitcoin payments and
donations are accepted however. [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis of this processing is the
necessity to the execution of the contract between you and us. [CLS] [SEP]

**native applications:** when you use our native applications, we (or the
mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information in addition to
the information mentioned elsewhere in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we may use mobile
analytics software (such as fabric.io app statistics and crash reporting, play
store app statistics, app store app statistics, or self-hosted sentry crash
reporting) to send crash information to our developers so that we can fix bugs
rapidly. [CLS] [SEP] some platforms (such as the google play store or the apple app store)
may also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics like which type of devices
and operating systems that are most commonly used (like percentage of android
6.x vs android 7.x), the total number of installs, total number of uninstalls,
and the total number of active users, and may be governed by the privacy
policy and terms and conditions of the google play store or the apple app
store. [CLS] [SEP] none of the software on our apps will ever access or track any
location-based information from your device at any time. [CLS] [SEP] any personal data
acquired during this process is anonymized. [CLS] [SEP]

**import assistant:** when using import assistant to transfer your data, you
can choose from multiple options:  
**import assistant with “sign in with google”:** when you use our import
assistant tool to import your data from google and authenticate using the
“sign in with google” option, import assistant’s use of information received
from google apis will comply with the [google api services user data
policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-
policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the limited
use requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

**import assistant with a username and password combination:** when you use
our import assistant tool to import your emails from another service provider,
the credentials of the email account from which the importation is performed
are stored by the company for the duration of the importation. [CLS] [SEP] once the
importation is performed, those credentials are entirely deleted from our
systems. [CLS] [SEP]

## data use

we do not have any advertising on our site. [CLS] [SEP] any data that we do have will
never be shared except under the circumstances described below in the data
disclosure section. [CLS] [SEP] we do not do any analysis on the limited data we do
possess with two exceptions:

  * emails sent unencrypted to protonmail accounts (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] gmail to protonmail) are scanned automatically pursuing the legitimate interest of detecting spam so we can block ips which are sending a lot of spam to protonmail users and place spam messages in a spam directory. [CLS] [SEP] inbound messages are scanned for spam in memory, and then encrypted and written to disk. [CLS] [SEP] we do not possess the technical ability to scan messages after they have been encrypted. [CLS] [SEP]
  * emails sent by protonmail users to outside (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] gmail) users with encryption disabled are scanned automatically pursuing the legitimate interest of detecting spam in the same manner as incoming email. [CLS] [SEP] this is to ensure a protonmail account which is being used for spamming purposes can be detected and locked so email deliverability for legitimate users is not degraded. [CLS] [SEP]

## data storage

all servers used in connection with the provisioning of the service are
located in switzerland and wholly owned and operated by the company. [CLS] [SEP] only
employees of the company have physical or other access to the servers. [CLS] [SEP] data is
always stored in encrypted format on our servers. [CLS] [SEP] offline backups may be
stored periodically, but these are also encrypted. [CLS] [SEP] we do not possess the
ability to access any user encrypted message content on either the production
servers or in the backups. [CLS] [SEP]

## third party networks

proton's alternative routing technology allows proton apps to bypass many
censorship blocks, but your network traffic may go through third party
networks which we do not control. [CLS] [SEP] this could enable a third party to record
your ip address or see that you are using proton apps (the same information
that your internet service provider is able to see). [CLS] [SEP] these third parties
cannot see your actual data, which remains encrypted. [CLS] [SEP] by default, alternative
routing is not used for proton apps unless they detect that censorship
measures are active on your network. [CLS] [SEP] alternative routing can also be
completely disabled in the settings panel of all of our mobile and desktop
applications. [CLS] [SEP] however, doing so may cause you to be unable to access your
proton account if you are on a network that is censoring proton. [CLS] [SEP] [learn
more](https://protonmail.com/blog/anti-censorship-alternative-routing)

## right to access, rectification, erasure, portability, and right to lodge a
complaint

through the service, you can directly access, edit, delete or export personal
data processed by the company in your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

if your account has been suspended for a breach of our terms and conditions,
and you would like to exercise the rights related to your personal data, you
can make a request to our support team. [CLS] [SEP]

in case of violation of your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint
to the competent supervisory authority. [CLS] [SEP]

## data retention

when a protonmail account is closed, data is immediately deleted from
production servers. [CLS] [SEP] active accounts will have data retained indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP]
deleted emails are also permanently deleted from production servers. [CLS] [SEP] deleted
data may be retained in our backups for up to 14 days. [CLS] [SEP]

## data disclosure

we will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are instructed to
do so by a fully binding request coming from the competent swiss authorities
(legal obligation). [CLS] [SEP] while we may comply with electronically delivered notices
(see exceptions below), the disclosed data can only be used in court after we
have received an original copy of the court order by registered post or in
person, and provide a formal response. [CLS] [SEP]

if a request is made for encrypted message content that protonmail does not
possess the ability to decrypt, the fully encrypted message content may be
turned over. [CLS] [SEP] if permitted by law, protonmail will always contact a user first
before any data disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] under swiss law, it is obligatory to notify the
target of a data request, although such notification may come from the
authorities and not from the company. [CLS] [SEP]

protonmail may from time to time, contest requests if there is a public
interest in doing so. [CLS] [SEP] in such situations, the company will not comply with the
request until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, not
all requests described in our transparency report will lead to data
disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]

## modifications to privacy policy

protonmail reserves the right to periodically review and change this policy
from time to time and we will notify users who have enabled the notification
preference about changes to our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] continued use of the service
will be deemed as acceptance of such changes. [CLS] [SEP]
