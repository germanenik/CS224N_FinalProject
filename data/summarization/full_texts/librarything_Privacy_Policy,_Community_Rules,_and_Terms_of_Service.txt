privacy and tos ____

[ about librarything](/about)[privacy and tos](/privacy)[press
information](/press)[who we are](/whoweare.php)[contact us](/contact)

## it's for you

[authors](/about/authors)[libraries](/about/libraries)[publishers](/about/publishers)[bookstores](/about/bookstores)

# privacy policy, community rules, and terms of service

_this policy has been updated and is effective as of may 25, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] the
previous version may be found[here](/privacy_20180524.php)._

these terms apply to users of librarything.com, and its associated domains,
such as librarything.nl and librarything.es. [CLS] [SEP] they also apply to tinycat
(librarycat.org). [CLS] [SEP]

## privacy policy

### the law

we take reader privacy very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] reader privacy enjoys special
constitutional protections under us law, and librarything will not cooperate
with us law enforcement unless compelled to do so. [CLS] [SEP] librarything will not
cooperate with non-us law enforcement unless compelled, or if we are convinced
the law is at least as just, and applied as justly, as us standards. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are using librarything from a foreign country with an oppressive government,
librarything urges you not to put yourself at risk. [CLS] [SEP]

as of june 30, 2020, we have never received a national security letter, fisa
order, or any other classified request for user information. [CLS] [SEP]

### no sale of personal information

librarything will not sell or give personally-identifiable information to any
third party. [CLS] [SEP] this would be evil, and we are not evil. [CLS] [SEP] yes,
[still](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-
dont-be-evil-code-conduct-removed-alphabet-a8361276.html). [CLS] [SEP]

there is one exception to this rule, described below (see reviews under
sharing and transfer of information). [CLS] [SEP] review sharing is entirely optional and
member-controlled. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve and currently exercise the right to sell or give away anonymous or
aggregate information. [CLS] [SEP]

see sharing and transfer of information, below, for more on this topic. [CLS] [SEP]

### emails from librarything

librarything membership does not require an email address. [CLS] [SEP]

librarything respects your inbox. [CLS] [SEP] we do not sell your email address to
authors, publishers, marketing companies, or anyone else. [CLS] [SEP]

by default, most new members who provide their email address are subscribed to
our "state of the thing" newsletter. [CLS] [SEP] members who join from the eu after may
25, 2018 are not subscribed automatically, and will have to consent explicitly
to receive the state of the thing. [CLS] [SEP]

by default, members who provide their email address receive profile comments
by email. [CLS] [SEP] this can be disabled in the [privacy center](/settings/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]
librarything reserves the right to send profile-comment emails for gdpr-exempt
system notifications, and customer support. [CLS] [SEP]

see librarything early reviewers and member giveaways, below, for terms
surrounding those optional programs. [CLS] [SEP]

### member privacy center

all librarything members have access to their own member [privacy
center](/settings/privacy), where they can see and then update:

  * subscription settings for different types of librarything emails
  * review-sharing preferences
  * eu or non-eu residency
  * display preferences for name, location and other non-required fields
  * application-sharing preferences, such as to facebook and twitter
  * export and download account data (incomplete as of june 8, 2018)
  * disable or delete your account

### private libraries

librarything allows "private" libraries—libraries that others can't see. [CLS] [SEP] we
cannot give an absolute 100% guarantee of privacy. [CLS] [SEP] after all, even amazon had
a day when all their "anonymous" reviewers were exposed by mistake. [CLS] [SEP] if the
public disclosure of your library would really damage you, by all means don't
post it online. [CLS] [SEP]

librarything has a "private books" feature, marked as a "beta" feature. [CLS] [SEP] it is
not fully functional, and does not guarantee security. [CLS] [SEP]

## community rules

### member accounts

individual accounts are designed for personal collections. [CLS] [SEP] couples and
families are fine too. [CLS] [SEP] organizations, like churches, companies, schools, and
museums, can also join, with some restrictions. [CLS] [SEP] (see [organizational
accounts](/organizations).)

in event of dispute, account ownership is determined as follows: if a paid
account--from when librarything charged a modest membership fee for accounts
with over 200 books--ownership belongs to the party that paid for the
membership. [CLS] [SEP] for all other accounts, ownership is determined by the email
address linked to the account. [CLS] [SEP] if there is no email address linked to the
account, librarything staff will make a good faith effort to determine
ownership. [CLS] [SEP] our decisions are final. [CLS] [SEP]

### social features

#### freedom of discussion and personal attacks

  * librarything prohibits all personal attacks on members. [CLS] [SEP] as [wikipedia's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:no_personal_attacks) policy states, "comment on content, not on the contributor."
  * personal attacks are attacks on a person. [CLS] [SEP] to dispute or disparage someone's words is not a personal attack. [CLS] [SEP] it is the line between "you are a liar" and "your recent post was a lie." the former is a violation of the tos. [CLS] [SEP] the latter is not. [CLS] [SEP]
  * personal attacks include name-calling. [CLS] [SEP] name-calling is not restricted to pure insults (e.g., "asshole"), but also ones that imply both a personal and a content problem (e.g., "liar," "nazi"). [CLS] [SEP]
  * librarything has no speech code per se. [CLS] [SEP] you can dispute ideas and words without limitation. [CLS] [SEP]

#### good advice

  * use common sense. [CLS] [SEP] be polite. [CLS] [SEP] think before you post. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you're upset by something or someone, try to calm down before responding. [CLS] [SEP]
  * discussions can become heated and passionate. [CLS] [SEP] don't forget that the person on the other side is human. [CLS] [SEP]
  * remember that librarything talk is a public space; don't say anything to others that you wouldn't want a room full of people to overhear. [CLS] [SEP]
  * avoid quoting or otherwise exposing private communication. [CLS] [SEP] while this does not necessarily violate the terms of service, you should consider whether it qualifies as a personal attack or a disclosure of private information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * consider the context before posting. [CLS] [SEP] a political or religious dispute does not belong in a knitting group. [CLS] [SEP]

#### how to deal with abuse

  * if you come across an abusive post, click the "flag abuse" link. [CLS] [SEP] the flag will be visible only after it has been flagged twice. [CLS] [SEP] after four different users have flagged a post, it will be deleted. [CLS] [SEP]
  * please do not flag posts as "abuse" simply because you disagree with what is said, or if someone criticizes your favorite book, author, or idea--that's not abuse, it's a difference of opinion. [CLS] [SEP] we welcome differences of opinion!
  * librarything staff do not review all flags. [CLS] [SEP] severe abuse should be reported to librarything staff. [CLS] [SEP]
  * one violation of the terms of service will not be considered to justify another one. [CLS] [SEP]
  * reasonable people can disagree about what constitutes abuse, but flagging is not a weapon. [CLS] [SEP] clear misuse of the flagging feature—either to flag or counter-flag—is itself a manipulation of the system and a violation of the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### how librarything deals with abuse

  * as stated, members are encouraged to report abuse, not merely to flag it. [CLS] [SEP] email info@librarything.com. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when reporting abuse be as specific as possible. [CLS] [SEP]
  * avoid responding to abuse with abuse. [CLS] [SEP] it will not be excused. [CLS] [SEP]
  * librarything staff are empowered to admonish, warn, suspend, and ban users for violations of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we are happy to talk things through, but our decisions are final. [CLS] [SEP]

#### other rules

  * librarything is not an advertising medium. [CLS] [SEP] egregious commercial solicitation is forbidden. [CLS] [SEP]
  * no matter how great your novel, this _does_ apply to authors. [CLS] [SEP] (see [tips and guidelines for authors](http://www.librarything.com/about_authors.php).)
  * authors caught manipulating the system have had all their books permanently marked with a spam and manipulation warning. [CLS] [SEP] you don't want that, believe me. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not spam member comments or group invitations. [CLS] [SEP] inviting people in your town to a new group is okay; inviting hundreds of members is not. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not repost flagged content in talk. [CLS] [SEP] if you believed you were flagged unfairly, go ahead and discuss the issue (without getting personal). [CLS] [SEP] you can discuss it, with short selections. [CLS] [SEP] but you may not repost it. [CLS] [SEP] if people want to read it, they can; talk allows you to click something to see the flagged content. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * do not create "pointless," "meaningless" or "random" groups or topics. [CLS] [SEP] we give all groups the benefit of the doubt, but the creation of multiple, duplicative and contentless groups is against these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
  * no personal groups (groups with fewer than two members). [CLS] [SEP] 
  * do not intentionally disclose sensitive private information about another member. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may not post any content that violates copyright or other intellectual property law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * librarything may not be used for any illegal activity. [CLS] [SEP]
  * librarything may not be used to injure, threaten, stalk, impersonate, or harass someone. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not plagiarize another member's content. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not upload x-rated or otherwise highly objectionable pictures. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not upload suggestive images of minors or seeming minors. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your username may not be an insult, either general or specific. [CLS] [SEP] sheesh!
  * we reserve the right to remove accounts with no books after three months. [CLS] [SEP] (but we have never done so.)

#### system integrity

  * do not subvert or misuse site features. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not set up "shell" or "sock puppet" accounts for any purpose whatsover. [CLS] [SEP]
  * common knowledge, covers and other core, shared bibliographic data must be edited in good faith. [CLS] [SEP]
  * librarything is for _your_ books--books you own, have read or want. [CLS] [SEP] it would not be appropriate to fill your librarything catalog with all the books in your local library or project gutenberg. [CLS] [SEP]
  * except by permission or through an authorized api, you may not add to or query your library automatically. [CLS] [SEP] see our [apis](http://www.librarything.com/services/). [CLS] [SEP]

### early reviewers and member giveaways

librarything early reviewers ("lter") gives librarything members the chance to
receive and review advanced reader editions of upcoming books from select
publishers. [CLS] [SEP]

librarything member giveaways ("ltmg") are an informal way for librarything
members and authors to give away books. [CLS] [SEP] ltmg reviews may be requested, but not
required. [CLS] [SEP]

the mailing address and email information you provide for either program will
only be used to send you books. [CLS] [SEP]

recipients of books who submit reviews to librarything hereby grant
librarything, the book's publisher, and its author perpetual non-exclusive
permission to use of the review, together with their first name and city/town
of residence, for purposes of entertainment, advertising, promotion, or
publicity without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP]
librarything, the publisher, and the author reserve the right to edit reviews
for clarity or language or to use only excerpts from them. [CLS] [SEP] neither
librarything nor the publisher is under any obligation to publish a review. [CLS] [SEP]

for more rules and conditions see [your
profile](http://www.librarything.com/er/profile). [CLS] [SEP]

### pay-for-review schemes

librarything encourages members to participate in book give-away programs. [CLS] [SEP]
(librarything has two: [early reviewers](http://www.librarything.com/er/list)
and [member giveaways](http://www.librarything.com/er/giveaway/list).) we
forbid reviews from "pay-for-review" schemes. [CLS] [SEP]

  * reviewers must be free to write what they think. [CLS] [SEP] they may not be required or rewarded to write positive reviews, or punished for writing bad ones. [CLS] [SEP]
  * reviewers must own and control their reviews, granting other parties only a non-exclusive license. [CLS] [SEP]
  * reviewers must act on their own volition, cross-posting their review when and where they want. [CLS] [SEP] companies that sell services based on how many sites get reviews are explicitly forbidden from using librarything. [CLS] [SEP]
  * reviewers must not be paid for their reviews, except in free books and similar non-monetary perks. [CLS] [SEP]

### member recommendations

in adding a member recommendation to any given work page, you are expected to
make good-faith, disinterested recommendations. [CLS] [SEP] you can only make three
recommendations per book, and cannot recommend the same book more than five
times overall. [CLS] [SEP] **recommending your own book is strictly forbidden.** members
can rate the validity of other member recommendations from the [rate
recommendations](http://www.librarything.com/profile_raterecommendations.php)
page. [CLS] [SEP] you are free to recommend books already listed by others or by
librarything itself. [CLS] [SEP]

## terms of service

### eu members and the general data protection regulation (gdpr)

librarything abides by us law. [CLS] [SEP] we also intend to voluntarily follow the
provisions of the general data protection regulation (gdpr), which applies to
eu citizens and residents. [CLS] [SEP] we must therefore identify who is and who is not
covered by the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

as of may 25, 2018, librarything has assigned eu status to members based upon
their ip address at sign-up, or, where that is not available to us, recent
usage. [CLS] [SEP] this status does not change unless changed by the member. [CLS] [SEP]

to change your eu status, go to your member [privacy
center](/settings/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] choosing the incorrect legal status is a violation
of librarything's terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]

#### data protection officer

per the gdpr, librarything's data protection officer (dpo) is tim spalding. [CLS] [SEP]
our dpo can be reached at tim@librarything.com. [CLS] [SEP]

#### the gdpr's defined roles and the handling of data in librarything and
tinycat

under the terms of the gdpr, librarything operates as either **data
controller** or **data processor** , depending on whether the service is
provided to users directly, or to organizations which have their own users. [CLS] [SEP]

for tinycat customers—excepting free, personal members—librarything is assumed
to be in the position of data processor, and the customer in the position of
data controller, managing the data of their **data subjects**. [CLS] [SEP] the same may
apply to librarything customers using librarything's "lending" feature or
otherwise providing librarything to others. [CLS] [SEP]

it is the data controller's ultimate responsibility for controlling their
patron or student (i.e., data subject) data, and ensuring gdpr compliance for
their data subjects, including collecting consent, managing consent-
revocation, enabling access, etc. [CLS] [SEP]

### copyright

by posting content to librarything, you grant--and you represent and warrant
that you have the right to grant, represent and warrant--librarything a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, omnipotent, royalty-free, fully-
transferable and sublicenseable right to display, use, analyze, aggregate,
modify, adapt, publish, translate, transform, create derivative works from and
perform in any venue or media, online or offline, as well as

> "in painting, sculpture, and rapt poesy, / and arts, though unimagined, yet
> to be." (shelley, _prometheus unbound_ )

**we do not assert copyright over the things you post to librarything. [CLS] [SEP] the
phrase "non-exclusive" above means you can post your content elsewhere.** by
posting something to librarything you let us use it, but you do not restrict
what you can do with it. [CLS] [SEP] we love it when people post their reviews on their
blog, on amazon and other sites!

as stated above, librarything will not sell any personally-identifiable
information to any third party. [CLS] [SEP]

you can control whether your reviews will ever be made available to libraries
or others. [CLS] [SEP] click [here](/editprofile.php) to edit your profile and change your
preference. [CLS] [SEP]

### get off my lawn, you kids!

the children's online privacy protection act (coppa) severely restricts what
information can be collected from children under 13. [CLS] [SEP] the eu's general data
protection regulation (gdpr) also severely restricts what information can be
collected from children under 16. [CLS] [SEP] for these reasons, all children under 13 are
prohibited from using librarything, and, unfortunately, all european union
children under 16 are prohibited from using librarything. [CLS] [SEP] _au revoir mes
petits choux!_

librarything's age minimum does not apply to tinycat customers providing
tinycat to others. [CLS] [SEP] tinycat libraries are, in this case, the data controller/s
and are responsible for ensuring gdpr compliance for their patrons. [CLS] [SEP] tinycat
does not provide messaging or social networking features to patrons. [CLS] [SEP]

librarything is a warm and welcoming community, and almost everyone is nice. [CLS] [SEP]
but younger members, and members of all ages, are warned not to provide
profile information without weighing the risks and benefits, and never to
provide their phone number, address, or other critical personal data online. [CLS] [SEP]

### dmca

if you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that
constitutes copyright infringement, please notify librarything as set forth in
the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 ("dmca"). [CLS] [SEP] for your complaint to
be valid under the dmca, you must provide the following information in
writing:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the service;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] information reasonably sufficient to permit librarything to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, e-mail address;
  5. [CLS] [SEP] a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
  6. [CLS] [SEP] a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner. [CLS] [SEP]

the above information should be submitted to the following designated agent:

> tim spalding librarything, inc. [CLS] [SEP] attn: dmca notice 286 spring street #2,
> portland, me 04102 phone: 207-899-4108 email: [info![at
> sign](https://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/squiggle.gif)librarything.com](mailto:info@librarything.com)

under federal law, if you knowingly misrepresent that online material is
infringing, you may be subject to criminal prosecution for perjury and civil
penalties, including monetary damages, court costs, and attorneys' fees. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying librarything and
its affiliates that your copyrighted material has been infringed. [CLS] [SEP] the
preceding requirements are intended to comply with librarything's rights and
obligations under the dmca, including 17 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] §512(c), but do not constitute
legal advice. [CLS] [SEP] it may be advisable to contact an attorney regarding your rights
and obligations under the dmca and other applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

please also note that we laugh off requests to remove books you don't like on
dmca grounds. [CLS] [SEP] book titles and author names are not copyrightable. [CLS] [SEP] that's not
how this works. [CLS] [SEP] that's not how any of this works. [CLS] [SEP]

### hipaa compliance and patron privacy

if you're a health industry organization considering
[tinycat](https://www.librarycat.org/) and librarything for tracking patrons
and lending data, please be advised that librarything does not ensure full
[hipaa](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/)
compliance. [CLS] [SEP]

consider these tips to maintain patron privacy within tinycat and
librarything:

  * do not share your admin login with anyone unless you expect them to have access to all of your library and patron data. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not add patron information, such as names and phone numbers, but use only patron barcodes or ids. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have simple circulation enabled, go to your [patron accounts settings](https://www.librarycat.org/admin/settings/patronaccounts), and select _barcode/id_ under the "patron list" setting. [CLS] [SEP] this will protect the privacy of your patrons' names. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have full circulation enabled, go to your [patrons settings](https://www.librarycat.org/admin/settings/patronsettings) and make sure that all patron fields except "barcode/patron id" are set to _admin only_. [CLS] [SEP] set the "barcode/patron id" field to _patron can see_ , if you prefer. [CLS] [SEP]

### sharing and transfer of information

librarything provides enrichment services, including librarything for
libraries (<https://www.librarything.com/forlibraries>) and syndetics unbound
(<https://proquest.syndetics.com>), which dynamically enrich library catalogs
and other book sites with data from librarything and librarything members. [CLS] [SEP]
librarything also provides access to the same information via data feeds. [CLS] [SEP]

our enrichment services include aggregate, anonymous and anonymized metadata,
such as popularity, average ratings, and tags. [CLS] [SEP] no personally-identifiable
information is shared with this data. [CLS] [SEP]

our enrichment services also include some member-provided reviews. [CLS] [SEP] such
sharing includes member names and the content of user reviews. [CLS] [SEP] members can

center](/settings/privacy), above), including options to share with no outside
entity, with just libraries, or with all entities. [CLS] [SEP] changing these settings in
no way affect members' ability to use the site. [CLS] [SEP]

reviews from members who elect to share reviews with all entities may be
shared with powerreviews, a review-aggregation service used by booksellers and
retailers. [CLS] [SEP] starting january 15, 2021, this data may include ip addresses, to
be used for the sole purpose of powerreview's fraud- and spam-detection

the keys necessary to perform api requests. [CLS] [SEP] in other words, all that stuff
that facebook gave companies like cambridge analytics, and which they misused,
we have never stored and don't store now. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to store your
facebook "name."

### we take it all back

these terms and conditions are subject to the usual change-at-any-time rule
that websites put on their terms and conditions and which seem so unfair. [CLS] [SEP]
("what, i have to submit a dna sample?") we have edited them as new situations
have come up, but we promise not to change any of the core principles,
particularly with regard to sale of information, copyright and death rays. [CLS] [SEP] we
promise to make all changes openly, with tracking and with the opportunity for
users to withdraw their accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

by using librarything.com directly or through a medium like a computer with a
keyboard and maybe a mouse attached you agree to take these important and
consequential terms of use seriously even though, or even because, we have
only one sentence at the end in capital letters. [CLS] [SEP]

## tired, yet?

### employment

librarything is an equal opportunity employer and will not discriminate
against any employee or applicant on the basis of religion, race, color,
national origin, ethnic origin, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation,

status, veteran status, or any other classification protected by applicable
federal, state, or local law. [CLS] [SEP]
