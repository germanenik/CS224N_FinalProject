## how does google protect my privacy and keep my information secure?

we know security and privacy are important to you – and they are important to
us, too. [CLS] [SEP] we make it a priority to provide strong security and give you
confidence that your information is safe and accessible when you need it. [CLS] [SEP]

we’re constantly working to ensure strong security, protect your privacy, and
make google even more effective and efficient for you. [CLS] [SEP] we spend hundreds of
millions of dollars every year on security, and employ world-renowned experts
in data security to keep your information safe. [CLS] [SEP] we also built easy-to-use
privacy and security tools like google dashboard, 2-step verification and ads
settings. [CLS] [SEP] so when it comes to the information you share with google, you’re in
control. [CLS] [SEP]

you can learn more about safety and security online, including how to protect
yourself and your family online, at the [google safety
center](https://www.google.com/safetycenter/?hl=en). [CLS] [SEP]

[learn more](https://privacy.google.com?hl=en) about how we keep your personal
information private and safe — and put you in control. [CLS] [SEP]

## how can i remove information about myself from google's search results?

google search results are a reflection of the content publicly available on
the web. [CLS] [SEP] search engines can’t remove content directly from websites, so
removing search results from google wouldn’t remove the content from the web. [CLS] [SEP]
if you want to remove something from the web, you should [contact the
webmaster](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109?hl=en) of the site
the content is posted on and ask him or her to make a change. [CLS] [SEP] once the content
has been removed and google has noted the update, the information will no
longer appear in google’s search results. [CLS] [SEP] if you have an urgent removal
request, you can also [visit our help page for more
information](https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en). [CLS] [SEP]

## are my search queries sent to websites when i click on google search
results?

in some cases, yes. [CLS] [SEP] when you click on a search result in google search, your
web browser also may send the internet address, or url, of the search results
page to the destination webpage as the [referrer url](privacy/key-
terms?hl=en#toc-terms-http). [CLS] [SEP] the url of the search results page may sometimes
contain the search query you entered. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using ssl search (google’s
encrypted search functionality), under most circumstances, your search terms
will not be sent as part of the url in the referrer url. [CLS] [SEP] there are some
exceptions to this behavior, such as if you are using some less popular
browsers. [CLS] [SEP] more information on ssl search can be found
[here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/173733?hl=en). [CLS] [SEP] search
queries or information contained in the referrer url may be available via
google analytics or an application programming interface (api). [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
advertisers may receive information relating to the exact keywords that
triggered an ad click. [CLS] [SEP]
