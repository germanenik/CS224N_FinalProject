[CLS] [SEP] you and bitly agree that the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these terms of service, and that you and bitly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

      2. [CLS] [SEP] conducting arbitration and arbitration rules. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association (“aaa”). [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual, the arbitration will be conducted under the aaa’s consumer arbitration rules (the “aaa rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] if you enter these terms of service on behalf of an organization, the arbitration will be conducted under the aaa’s commercial arbitration rules. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP] a party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to aaa and give notice to the other party as specified in the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa provides a form demand for arbitration at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP]
      3. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim is for u.s. [CLS] [SEP] $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim exceeds u.s. [CLS] [SEP] $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location.

[CLS] [SEP] if we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. [CLS] [SEP] if you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
      5. [CLS] [SEP] class action waiver. [CLS] [SEP] you and bitly agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution section shall be null and void. [CLS] [SEP]
      6. [CLS] [SEP] if bitly changes any of the terms of this “dispute resolution” section after the date you first accepted these terms of service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these terms of service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [support@bitly.com](mailto:%20support@bitly.com)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “last updated” date above or in the date of bitly’s email to you notifying you of such change. [CLS] [SEP] by rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and bitly in accordance with the terms of this “dispute resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these terms of service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these terms of service). [CLS] [SEP]
      7. [CLS] [SEP] severability. [CLS] [SEP] with the exception of any of the provisions in section 20(e) of these terms (“class action waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these terms of service is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these terms of service will still apply. [CLS] [SEP]
  11. [CLS] [SEP]  _miscellaneous_
    1. [CLS] [SEP]  **relationship of the parties.** the parties shall be independent contractors under this agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP]  **entire agreement and severability.** this agreement is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between the parties with respect thereto, including any non-disclosure agreements signed by the parties. [CLS] [SEP] except as may be modified in writing by the parties, including by a bitly enterprise supplemental agreement, no additional or conflicting terms set out on customer order, invoice, statement or other document, or contained in any “shrinkwrap” or “clickwrap” agreements, are binding. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP]  **force majeure.** except for any fees due hereunder, neither party shall not be liable for any delay in performing or failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such delay or failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, cyber-attacks, mechanical, electronic or communications failures, acts of god, terrorism, war, natural disasters, failure of any telecommunications or transportation or of any third party provider or supplier (e.g., host or app store providers) or labor disputes. [CLS] [SEP]
    4. [CLS] [SEP]  **assignment.** except to an affiliate or in the event of a merger, acquisition or other change of control, neither party may assign this agreement without the prior written permission of the other party, and any attempt to do so is void. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement shall be binding on any permitted successors and assigns. [CLS] [SEP]
    5. [CLS] [SEP]  **notices.** unless otherwise specified in this agreement, all notices under this agreement will be in writing to the addresses listed above and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when sent, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. [CLS] [SEP]
    6. [CLS] [SEP]  **headings; interpretation.** the section and paragraph headings in this agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. [CLS] [SEP] any use of “including” “for example” or “such as” in this agreement shall be read as being followed by “without limitation.”
    7. [CLS] [SEP]  **export.** the parties shall comply with all applicable export and import control laws and regulations, and, in particular, shall not export or re-export the bitly services without all required united states and foreign government licenses. [CLS] [SEP]
    8. [CLS] [SEP]  **government use.** the bitly services are “commercial items” as that term is defined at 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 12.212. [CLS] [SEP] any access to or use of the bitly services by any government entity is prohibited, except as expressly permitted by the terms of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, any use by u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government entities must be in accordance with 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 12.212 and 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4. [CLS] [SEP] if customer uses the bitly services in its official capacity as an employee or representative of a u.s., state or local government entity and is legally unable to accept the indemnity, jurisdiction, venue or other clauses herein, then those clauses do not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
    9. [CLS] [SEP]  **general.** the failure of bitly to enforce any right or provision of these terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] the waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of bitly. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly set forth in these terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these terms or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
    10. [CLS] [SEP]  **publicity.** customer grants bitly the right to use customer’s logos or trademarks in marketing or publicity materials and on its website to identify customer as a customer that uses the bitly services. [CLS] [SEP]
