the following at least 48 hours prior to your next scheduled renewal date to
avoid charge: update your user account at lootcrate.com or email support at

if you cancel your subscription, you will not be eligible for a prorated
refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current

indirect, punitive, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages
or attorney's fees or costs, that result from the use of, or the inability to
use, the site or materials on or provided through the site, even if loot
crate‚Ñ¢ has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and even if a
remedy set forth in these terms of service is found to have failed its
essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] in no event will loot crate's‚Ñ¢ liability to you exceed the
amounts that you paid to loot crate‚Ñ¢ in connection with your loot crate‚Ñ¢
membership or other purchases made on the site. [CLS] [SEP] applicable law may not allow
the limitation of exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential
damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

while loot crate‚Ñ¢ takes precautions against security breaches, no website or
internet transmission is completely secure, and as such, loot crate‚Ñ¢ shall not
be liable for any damages whatsoever that may result from unauthorized access,
hacking, data loss, or other breaches that may occur on the site. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect
information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product
information received from our suppliers, loot crate‚Ñ¢ shall have the right to
refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. [CLS] [SEP]
loot crate‚Ñ¢ shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether
or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. [CLS] [SEP] if your
credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is
canceled, loot crate‚Ñ¢ shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card
account in the amount of the charge. [CLS] [SEP]

loot crate‚Ñ¢ has no liability for injury or damage caused by products within
the crate. [CLS] [SEP] such liability is the sole responsibility of the product brand or

these terms are applicable to you upon your accessing the site. [CLS] [SEP] these terms,
or any part of them, may be modified or terminated by loot crate‚Ñ¢ without

**arbitration agreement and class action waiver:**

purpose:

this arbitration agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of
any disputes that may arise between you and loot crate. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration is a form
of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit
their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an
arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided
in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial. [CLS] [SEP]

please read this arbitration agreement carefully. [CLS] [SEP] it provides that all
disputes between you and loot crate shall be resolved by binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
arbitration replaces the right to go to court. [CLS] [SEP] in the absence of this
arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring
claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be
represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to,
class actions). [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise provided, entering into this arbitration
agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and
all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] there is no judge or jury in
arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator must follow this arbitration agreement and can award the same
damages and relief as a court (including attorney's fees, if otherwise
authorized by applicable law). [CLS] [SEP]

for the purpose of this arbitration agreement, "loot crate" means the loot
company llc and loot crate, inc. [CLS] [SEP] and their respective parents, subsidiaries,
and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, and agents. [CLS] [SEP] the term ‚Äúdispute‚Äù means any dispute, claim, or
controversy between you and loot crate regarding any aspect of your
relationship with loot crate, whether based in contract, statute, regulation,
ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation,
fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or
any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability
or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the exception of the
enforceability of the class action waiver clause below). [CLS] [SEP] "dispute" is to be
given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. [CLS] [SEP]

we each agree that, except as provided below, any and all disputes, as defined
above, whether presently in existence or based on acts or omissions in the
past or in the future, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding
arbitration rather than in court in accordance with this arbitration
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

pre-arbitration dispute resolution:

for all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give
loot crate an opportunity to resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] you must commence this
process by mailing written notification to the loot company llc. [CLS] [SEP] that written
notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written
description of the dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you
seek. [CLS] [SEP] if loot crate does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction within
45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your
dispute in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you may pursue your dispute in a court only under the
circumstances described below. [CLS] [SEP]

you must initiate any dispute within one (1) year after such the basis for
your dispute arose, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary. [CLS] [SEP] in the
event that you do not initiate your dispute within such one (1) year period,
such dispute shall be time-barred. [CLS] [SEP]

arbitration procedures:

if this arbitration agreement applies and the dispute is not resolved as
provided above (‚Äúpre-arbitration claim resolution‚Äù) either you or loot crate
may initiate arbitration proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] the american arbitration association
(‚Äúaaa‚Äù), [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/ "www.adr.org"), or jams,
[www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/ "www.jamsadr.com"), will arbitrate
all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single
arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration,
and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
all issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this
arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

for arbitration before the aaa, for disputes of less than $75,000, the aaa's
supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes will apply; for
disputes involving $75,000 or more, the aaa's commercial arbitration rules
will apply. [CLS] [SEP] in either instance, the aaa‚Äôs optional rules for emergency
measures of protection shall apply. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are available at www.adr.org
or by calling 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP] for arbitration before jams, the jams
comprehensive arbitration rules & procedures and the jams recommended
arbitration discovery protocols for domestic, commercial cases will apply. [CLS] [SEP] the
jams rules are available at[www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/
"www.jamsadr.com") or by calling 1-800-352-5267. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement
governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. [CLS] [SEP] under
no circumstances will class action or representative action procedures or
rules apply to the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

because your contract with loot crate, the terms of service, and this this
arbitration agreement concern interstate commerce, the federal arbitration act
(‚Äúfaa‚Äù) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. [CLS] [SEP] however, the arbitrator
will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the faa and the
applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. [CLS] [SEP]

arbitration award:

the arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be
available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award
relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not
provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. [CLS] [SEP] such award by the
arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of
appeal provided by the faa, and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

governing law:

your use of this site constitutes your consent and submission to service of
process under applicable united states law and your submission to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in
the state of california in new york county, for the purposes of any legal
action or claim pertaining to these terms of service, or arising from the use
of this site, your user account and/or any website content and you hereby
waive any defenses such as lack of personal jurisdiction or forum non
conveniens. [CLS] [SEP] these terms of service shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the law of the state of california, and without regard to the
choice of law principles thereof

location of arbitration:

you may initiate arbitration in either los angeles, ca, or in the federal
judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written
notification of pre-arbitration dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that loot
crate initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial
district that includes your address that you provide in your written
notification of pre-arbitration dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

payment of arbitration fees and costs:

loot crate will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator‚Äôs costs and
expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you
incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert
witnesses. [CLS] [SEP] fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable
law. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law,
if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with loot crate as provided
in the section above titled ‚Äúpre-arbitration dispute resolution‚Äù and the
arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you
will be entitled to recover from loot crate your actual and reasonable
attorney‚Äôs fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

disputes with other users:

if you have a dispute with one or more users, you release loot crate‚Ñ¢ and from
claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
nature, known and unknown including without limitation attorney‚Äôs fees,
arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a
california resident, you waive california civil code ¬ß1542, which says: "a
general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if
known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

**class action waiver:**

the parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person‚Äôs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or
representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative
action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both
you and loot crate specifically agree to do so following initiation of the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] neither you, nor any other member of loot crate and/or user of
loot crate services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise
participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney
general proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

limitation of procedural rights:

you understand and agree that, by entering into this arbitration agreement,
you and loot crate are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a
trial before a judge or jury in a public court. [CLS] [SEP] in the absence of this
arbitration agreement, you and loot crate might otherwise have had a right or
opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to
participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including
class actions). [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise provided below, you give up those rights. [CLS] [SEP]
other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to
appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
the right to appellate review of an arbitrator‚Äôs decision is much more limited
than in court, and in general an arbitrator‚Äôs decision may not be appealed for
errors of fact or law. [CLS] [SEP]

small claims court:

as an alternative to arbitration, you may bring a claim against loot crate in
a small claims court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] such a claim may be brought in
your name only, and not as a class action, representative action, consolidated
action or private attorney general action. [CLS] [SEP] no small claims court or other
court shall have the right to consolidate multiple parties‚Äô claims or award
relief to any person who is not a direct party to such small claims court
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

continuation:

this arbitration agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with
loot crate and your use of loot crate services. [CLS] [SEP]

sales tax; such state and local sales tax is based on the shipping address and

related to use of the site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or
any other person accessing the site using your internet account. [CLS] [SEP]

**severability**

if any clause within these terms including but not limited to, the arbitration
agreement (and other than the class action waiver clause above), is found to
be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from these terms, and
the remainder of these terms will be given full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] if the class
action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then the entire
arbitration agreement will be unenforceable, and any dispute will be decided
by a court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

**discount codes**

except as may be explicitly permitted through this site, you agree not to

third-party links: in an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors,

has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and
