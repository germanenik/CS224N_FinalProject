provider and patient to ensure that only adults over 18 use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

# **if you are a provider**

this section applies only if you sign up and have been given access to a
provider account. [CLS] [SEP] some features are not activated automatically and require
explicit authorization by you. [CLS] [SEP]

## **types of data collected**

### **personal data**

we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information
that can be used to contact or identify you. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, and anything else
you provide in the waiting room will be seen by patients when they “enter” the
waiting room. [CLS] [SEP] such information includes:

  * email address
  * first name and last name
  * specialty* 
  * position or title*
  * national provider identifier (npi)*
  * states licensed to practice*
  * mobile number*
  * country, phone number **

_* this information is optional._

_** only required if using stripe payment services; this information is not
stored in the service._

by using the service, you allow us to contact you by email regarding service
features, changes, maintenance, and other products that may be introduced from
time-to-time. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you enable email notifications within the
service, we will send you an email notifying you that a patient is waiting in
the waiting room. [CLS] [SEP]

if you wish to be notified by text message that a patient is waiting in the
waiting room, you may optionally provide your mobile number. [CLS] [SEP]

all your data are processed in secure and hipaa-compliant cloud services using
healthcare blocks. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to focus on creating solutions where high
security and privacy are enabled by default. [CLS] [SEP] we use industry-best security
measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
unauthorized destruction of all your data. [CLS] [SEP]

### **single sign-on**

you may elect to login to the doxy.me service via a third-party authentication
service. [CLS] [SEP] this is called single sign-on (sso) and means that you must first
authenticate to that third-party identity provider prior to accessing the
service. [CLS] [SEP] facebook and google identity connectors are built into the service
for the you to optionally use. [CLS] [SEP] also, doxy.me offers a custom feature whereby
you may specify your own sso service. [CLS] [SEP]

by using sso, you will be transferred to an authentication agent for that
particular identity provider where your login credentials (usually a name and
password) are used to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not have access to
credentials used by a third-party identity provider. [CLS] [SEP] once you have
authenticated via sso, a token is returned to us indicating that your identity
has been verified and you will be granted access to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### **invitations**

you may invite patients to sessions by the following methods:

  * email sent by the service
  * email sent by your computer or smartphone email system
  * email sent by a web service (e.g., gmail, hotmail)
  * mobile text message

any information you enter into the invitation will be used to create and send
the message. [CLS] [SEP] once that task is completed, the information is no longer used
and is permanently deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

### **screenshare**

the service provides a feature whereby you may share all or part your computer
screen with the patient or you may request to view the patient’s screen. [CLS] [SEP]

there are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen. [CLS] [SEP] it is
up to you to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than
that which the patient is allowed to see) is viewable during the screensharing
session. [CLS] [SEP]

conversely, it is up to the patient to ensure that there is no sensitive or
confidential information on their screen prior to agreeing to the screenshare. [CLS] [SEP]

### **protected health information (phi)**

although the doxy.me service is targeted to the healthcare community, no phi
is collected during the video conference between patient and provider. [CLS] [SEP]

any health or other sensitive information you discuss or share with your
patient is encrypted over a secure channel using the ssl internet protocol. [CLS] [SEP]
doxy.me will not, and is not, able to view the audio-video component of the
session. [CLS] [SEP]

### **file transfer**

then destroyed after 15 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]

### **chats**

any chats between you and the patient are temporarily stored in your computer
memory, not on doxy.me servers. [CLS] [SEP] your chat history stays after the session ends
so you may copy to an internal system. [CLS] [SEP] once the browser is closed, the chat
history is permanently deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

### **patient payment information**

if you choose to ask the patient to pay you during the session, you may use
the third-party stripe credit card payment system. [CLS] [SEP] prior to requesting
payment, you must setup a stripe account in the settings section of your
account. [CLS] [SEP] the patient will receive a payment pop-up screen asking to provide
their name and credit card details. [CLS] [SEP] all credit card transactions are handled
by stripe. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not capture or utilize any information entered in the
payment pop-up screen. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please visit
[https://stripe.com/](https://stripe.com/)

### **service payment information**

if you choose to upgrade the service for a fee, you have the option to pay via
the stripe third-party credit card payment system. [CLS] [SEP] all credit card
transactions are handled by stripe. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not capture or utilize any
information entered in the payment pop-up screen but does receive payment
information from stripe when the transaction is completed. [CLS] [SEP]

### **teleconsent appointment consent form**

you may ask or require a patient to sign a teleconsent appointment consent
form. [CLS] [SEP] the purpose of the form is to convey what telehealth communication is,
patient rights, and obligations for each party. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me provides a template
form or, depending on your account type, you may upload your own form. [CLS] [SEP]

after the patient signs the form, it should be downloaded by both you and your
patient as it is not stored by the service and will be permanently deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

### **session privacy**

at any time during the session, you may disable the audio, video, or both. [CLS] [SEP]
doing so may prevent effective communication with the patient. [CLS] [SEP] however, there
may be times when you wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons. [CLS] [SEP]

you may terminate the session at any time. [CLS] [SEP]



# **if you are a patient**

this section only applies if you have received a unique web link (such as
[https://yourclinic.doxy.me/drsmith](https://yourclinic.doxy.me/drsmith)) by a
provider and wish to communicate with the provider by video conference using
the service. [CLS] [SEP] some features are not activated automatically and require
explicit authorization by you. [CLS] [SEP]

## **types of data processed**

### **name to enter waiting room**

a patient does not need an account or register with doxy.me in order to use
the service. [CLS] [SEP]

a provider will email or text you a provider website link in order to enter
the waiting room. [CLS] [SEP] when you click on that link, it will take you to the welcome
screen and you will be asked to enter your name and click a “check in” button. [CLS] [SEP]

your name is only seen by the provider and used for an initial identification. [CLS] [SEP]
there is no verification of the entry, nor is there a requirement that you use
your full name. [CLS] [SEP] your name is used only for the current session and is not
stored or otherwise used by the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### **session privacy**

at any time during the session, you may disable the audio, video, or both. [CLS] [SEP]
doing so may prevent effective communication with the provider. [CLS] [SEP] however, there
may be times when you wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons. [CLS] [SEP]

you may also terminate the session at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

### **protected health information (phi)**

although the doxy.me service is targeted to the healthcare community, no phi
is collected during the session between patient and provider. [CLS] [SEP]

any health or other sensitive information you discuss or send the provider is
sent over a secure channel using the ssl internet protocol. [CLS] [SEP]

### **file transfer**

if you choose to send a file to the provider, that file will be sent securely
and then destroyed after 15 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]

### **photo capture**

if your provider chooses to capture a photo of you, that image will be sent
securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]

### **chats**

any chats between you and the provider are temporarily stored in computer
memory, not on doxy.me services. [CLS] [SEP] once the browser is closed, the chat history
is permanently deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

### **payment information**

if you choose to pay the provider during the session, a credit card
authorization screen will pop-up asking you to provide your name and credit
card details. [CLS] [SEP] all credit card transactions are handled by stripe, a third-
party. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not capture or utilize any information you enter in the
payment pop-up screen. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please visit
[https://stripe.com/](https://stripe.com/)

### **teleconsent appointment consent form**

your provider may ask you to sign a teleconsent appointment consent form. [CLS] [SEP] the
purpose of the form is to inform you of what telehealth communication is, and
your rights and obligations. [CLS] [SEP] you should read the form completely and not
hesitate to ask your provider for any clarifications. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are required to sign the form, your signature will be electronically
captured by using your mouse and be embedded in the form. [CLS] [SEP] the form may be
downloaded by both you and your provider and is not stored by the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### **screenshare**

the service provides a feature whereby you may share all or part of your
computer screen with the provider. [CLS] [SEP] you will be sent a message to confirm that
you wish to share your screen or a specific window. [CLS] [SEP]

there are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen. [CLS] [SEP] it is
up to you to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than
that which you wish to show the provider) be viewable during the screensharing
session. [CLS] [SEP]

for instance, if you do not wish the provider to see your email system or
other open windows, it would be best to terminate those applications prior to
the screenshare. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’d like to know more or exercise your right to opt out in regard to all
the sales carried out by doxy.me, both online and offline, you can contact us
for further information using the contact details provided in this document. [CLS] [SEP]

**what are the purposes for which we use your personal information?**

we may use your personal information to allow the operational functioning of
doxy.me and features thereof (“business purposes”). [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, your
personal information will be processed in a fashion necessary and
proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly
within the limits of compatible operational purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also use your personal information for other reasons such as for
commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “detailed information on
the processing of personal data” within this document), as well as for
complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent
authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an
actual damage. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not use your personal information for different, unrelated, or
incompatible purposes without notifying you. [CLS] [SEP]

## **your california privacy rights and how to exercise them**

**the right to know and to portability**

you have the right to request that we disclose to you:

  * the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;
  * in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where we disclose:
    * for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
    * for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient. [CLS] [SEP]

the disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information
collected or used over the past 12 months. [CLS] [SEP]

if we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be
"portable", i.e. [CLS] [SEP] delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to
transmit the information to another entity without hindrance – provided that
this is technically feasible. [CLS] [SEP]

**the right to request the deletion of your personal information**

you have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information,
subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited
to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on doxy.me, to
detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal
activities, to exercise certain rights etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

if no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will
delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do
so. [CLS] [SEP]

**how to exercise your rights**

to exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable
request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document. [CLS] [SEP]

for us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. [CLS] [SEP]
therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable
request which must:

  * provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
  * describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity
and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually
relates to you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a
person registered with the california secretary of state to act on your
behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor
under your parental authority. [CLS] [SEP]

you can submit a maximum number of two (2) requests over a period of 12
months. [CLS] [SEP]

**how and when we are expected to handle your request**

we will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide
information about how we will process your request. [CLS] [SEP]

we will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. [CLS] [SEP] should we need
more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we
need. [CLS] [SEP] in this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill
your request. [CLS] [SEP]

our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. [CLS] [SEP]

should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our
denial. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless
such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, we may
charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. [CLS] [SEP] in either case, we
will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it. [CLS] [SEP]
