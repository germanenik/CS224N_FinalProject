#  privacy policy

last modified: april 21, 2020

at ynab, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. [CLS] [SEP] every
company has a privacy policy, but when it comes right down to it, we want you
to understand how we protect your privacy and to know what data we collect and
how we use it. [CLS] [SEP] so let’s get to it. [CLS] [SEP]

## overview

this policy describes the types of information you need a budget llc (“ynab”,
“company” or “we”) may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit
and utilize the budgeting software available through our apps, software, and
the website [youneedabudget.com](https://www.youneedabudget.com)
(collectively, our “website“). [CLS] [SEP] this includes our practices for collecting,
using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information and the basis
for doing so. [CLS] [SEP]

this policy applies to information we collect on the website, in e-mail, text
and other electronic messages between you and this website and, through mobile
and desktop applications you download from this website or other services
(such as the ios app store or google play store), which provide dedicated non-
browser-based interaction between you and this website. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by
giving notice on this page and/or within this application and/or sending a
notice to you via any contact information available to us. [CLS] [SEP] it is strongly
recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last
modification listed at the top. [CLS] [SEP]

## collection and use of personal data

ynab relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise
process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] generally, this includes analytics, user database management,
managing support and contact requests, transaction aggregation, hosting and
backend infrastructure and infrastructure monitoring. [CLS] [SEP]

we process data:

  * in order to provide the services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the [terms of service](https://www.youneedabudget.com/terms). [CLS] [SEP] for example, we cannot provide our services without an email address to sign into your account, conduct customer support, or send educational materials; we cannot provide the service without users providing financial information on which a budget is based;
  * where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;
  * to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies;
  * where you have made the information public;
  * where necessary in the public interest;
  * where necessary for the purposes of ynab’s or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members or partners;
  * where you provide consent (for example, to join email mailing lists). [CLS] [SEP]

we also process your data based on our legitimate interest in:

  * providing a quality service and in improving that service;
  * ensuring the services are secure;
  * protection against fraud, spam and abuse, etc.;
  * understanding how clients and visitors interact with our websites and services, so that we can continuously improve the experience and effectiveness of doing so. [CLS] [SEP]

### categories of data we collect

we collect information about you, including information that directly or
indirectly identifies you, through your use of ynab. [CLS] [SEP] we do so:

  * when you provide the information, through filling out forms or otherwise providing information on our websites and apps;
  * when we connect to your financial institutions in order to retrieve transaction data on your behalf;
  * when you use location services to record transactions in our mobile apps;
  * when you correspond with us to receive customer support via email or chat. [CLS] [SEP]

this includes:

  * your email address that you provide to us as a username, or that is provided to us by your social media account(s) if you use those for sign-in. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your ip address when you interact with our website and apps. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you chose to directly link financial accounts to ynab, your login credentials (including usernames and passwords) for the accounts you link to our services, account security and/or challenge questions for those accounts, and other information from the financial accounts that you link to our service (including account balances, transactions and holdings). [CLS] [SEP]
  * your location when you record a transaction in our mobile applications and have previously activated location services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses different than that used to establish your account), if you contact us. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * details of transactions you carry out through our website and of the fulfillment of your orders. [CLS] [SEP] you may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our website. [CLS] [SEP]
  * information that you provide by filling in forms on our website. [CLS] [SEP] this includes information provided at the time of registering to use our website, subscribing to our service, or requesting further services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also ask you for information when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our website. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to provide you with customer support or service offerings, including responding to and resolving your inquiries and requests via email or text-based chat. [CLS] [SEP] when you request assistance from our customer support team with respect to importing third-party financial account data, to allow a customer support representative to review a limited amount of data from recent transactions for the sole purpose of facilitating technical implementation of the account aggregation services. [CLS] [SEP] when asked to do so by you, our customer support representative may utilize that transaction data on your behalf in interactions with third-party financial account providers intended to facilitate implementation of requested account aggregation within our services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### cookies & technical data

ynab collects information as visitors and clients browse and interact with the
website and/or apps. [CLS] [SEP]

##### site visitors

when you visit our website, we may place a cookie on your browser so that our
system can recognize you when you make a return visit. [CLS] [SEP] third parties may also
place cookies on your browser for targeted advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] that cookie
allows us to recognize your browser on a return visit. [CLS] [SEP] we do not otherwise
collect or process data when you are a visitor. [CLS] [SEP]

##### signed-in users

to help analyze how you and other visitors navigate ynab websites and
applications, and compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response
rates, we, with assistance from third-party analytics service providers
(described below), collect certain information when you visit our site. [CLS] [SEP] this
information includes ip address, geographic location of the device, browser
type, browser language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your
visit(s), page views and page elements (e.g., links) that you click, and other
similar data. [CLS] [SEP] we may use cookies, pixel tags, and tracking scripts on our site
or in our email messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such
information. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to provide better, more relevant content
on our site, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, to identify and
fix problems, and to improve your overall experience on our site. [CLS] [SEP]

##### opting out of cookies

there are a number ways to limit the cookies that your browser accepts or
limit the way in which they’re used. [CLS] [SEP]

one way to limit cookies is by opting out of third party cookies/advertising
networks, like [google analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
and the [digital advertising alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info). [CLS] [SEP] if you
are in canada or the eu you can use the [daac’s
youradchoices.ca](https://youradchoices.ca), or [edaa’s
youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) respectively. [CLS] [SEP] some people
use what are called “ad blockers” to limit advertising/tracking. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t
endorse any _particular_ ad blocker, but want you to know that it’s an option
since you’re reading this and are likely quite privacy-minded. [CLS] [SEP]

opting out of cookies using the above methods likely won’t cause problems with
our services per se, but it makes it harder for us to spend our advertising
budget effectively because we won’t know how you discovered ynab and sometimes
won’t even know if you’re already a customer of ours. [CLS] [SEP] among other things, that
means we might embarrass ourselves by showing you the same advertisement even
if you are already a fan. [CLS] [SEP] depending on the services you block, it might also
make it harder for us to know how you’re using our apps, or know if you’re
running into problems. [CLS] [SEP]

another way of limiting cookies is by controlling cookies in your web
browser’s settings. [CLS] [SEP] (disabling cookies in this way is more likely to actually
break or worsen the experience when using some of our services). [CLS] [SEP]  
here are instructions for the most common browsers:

  * [google chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-gb)
  * [internet explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)
  * [microsoft edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy)
  * [mozilla firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-us/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer#w_cookie-settings)
  * [safari (desktop)](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac)
  * [safari (mobile)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201265)
  * [android browser](https://support.google.com/ics/nexus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2425067)

### recipients of personal data

we share data to fulfill the purposes for which you provide it; to enforce or
apply our [terms of service](https://www.youneedabudget.com/terms), including
billing. [CLS] [SEP] we may disclose or transfer personal information that we collect or
you provide as described in this privacy policy:

  * to contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business, in particular providing infrastructure and analytics services, and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

    * by utilizing transaction aggregation services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of the respective privacy policies of those partners ([mx](https://www.mx.com/privacy-policy/), [plaid](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy)), and you expressly grant aggregation partners the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary to provide the services to you. [CLS] [SEP]
    * to the extent that any user previously utilized account linking and aggregation services through the service provider quovo, inc., you expressly authorize quovo, inc. [CLS] [SEP] to transmit any information or data arising out of those services to plaid, subsequent to the acquisition of quovo by plaid, so that plaid can offer you its services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our website users is among the assets transferred. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in aggregated form, and/or information that does not identify any individual. [CLS] [SEP]

  * with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

  * to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to enforce or apply our [terms of service](https://www.youneedabudget.com/terms) or terms of sale and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of you need a budget llc, our customers or others. [CLS] [SEP] this includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. [CLS] [SEP]

significant way, you have the right to provide your point of view and have
those decisions reviewed by a member of our staff. [CLS] [SEP]
