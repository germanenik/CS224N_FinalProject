and/or features (collectively, the "service") you acknowledge that you accept
the practices and policies outlined in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a
resident of the european union ("eu"), united kingdom, lichtenstein, norway,

brilliant collects information you voluntarily submit to the service, such as,

information you elect to submit to the service in a public or quasi-public
manner may be disclosed to other users of the application or the general
public ("user submission(s)"). [CLS] [SEP] for example–if you make a post to a message
board or chat forum that includes any personal information – such information
will be made publicly available. [CLS] [SEP] we endeavor to make sure the service's
functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended
submission. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types
of information whenever you interact with the service. [CLS] [SEP] such information may
include the user's ip address, domain server, and type of internet browser. [CLS] [SEP]
this information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer
the service. [CLS] [SEP] this information is anonymous and contains no personally
identifiable data. [CLS] [SEP]

_do not track policy._ through cookies we place on your browser or device, we
may collect information about your online activity after you leave our
services. [CLS] [SEP] just like any other usage information we collect, this information
allows us to improve the services and customize your online experience, and
otherwise as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] your browser may offer you a
"do not track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and
web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that
you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over
time and across different websites. [CLS] [SEP] our services do not support do not track

meet the foregoing age requirements is a "minor". [CLS] [SEP] minors are prohibited from
signing up or using the service in any way. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a minor, please do not
attempt to register for the services or send any personal information about
yourself to us. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn that we have collected personal information from a
minor, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe
that a minor may have provided us personal information, please contact us at
[privacy@brilliant.org](mailto:privacy@brilliant.org). [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to
require any user to verify that the user is not a minor, and if a user does
not provide such verification in a timely manner, we will terminate the user's

may be shared in a public or quasi-public manner. [CLS] [SEP]

_service providers and agents:_ we employ other companies and people to

_business transfers:_ in some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. [CLS] [SEP] in
these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the
business assets that are transferred. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, if brilliant, or substantially
all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that brilliant goes
out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the
assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that
such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of brilliant may continue to
use your personal information as set forth in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
