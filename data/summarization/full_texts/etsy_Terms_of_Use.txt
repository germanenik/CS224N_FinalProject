**this document and the other documents that we reference below make up our

short).**

north america or south america, the contract is between you and etsy, inc.; if

subsidiaries collectively as “etsy.”

all disputes through binding individual arbitration, which means that you
waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and that
you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or
representative actions.** _*_

this contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use etsy.com,
pattern by etsy, our mobile apps, and the other services provided by etsy
(we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our “services”), so please read
it carefully. [CLS] [SEP] by using any of our services (even just browsing one of our
websites), you’re agreeing to the terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t agree with the terms,
you may not use our services. [CLS] [SEP] agree with us? great, read on!

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] those other documents we mentioned

etsy’s services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to
make, sell, and buy unique goods. [CLS] [SEP] here’s a handy guide to help you understand
the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending on how you use the
services:

our house rules for everyone. [CLS] [SEP] if you use any of our services, you agree to
these terms, our [privacy policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/privacy), and our
[anti-discrimination policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/anti-
discrimination-policy/123551108902). [CLS] [SEP]

**[our house rules for sellers](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/sellers)**. [CLS] [SEP]
if you list any items for sale through our services, these policies apply to
you. [CLS] [SEP] you can read them [here](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/sellers). [CLS] [SEP]

**[our house rules for buyers](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/buyers)**. [CLS] [SEP]
if you use our services to browse or shop, these policies apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] you
can read them [here](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/buyers). [CLS] [SEP]

**[our house rules for third
parties](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/third-party)**. [CLS] [SEP] these policies
apply to [intellectual property owners](https://www.etsy.com/legal/ip), [etsy
api users](https://www.etsy.com/legal/api),
[affiliates](https://www.etsy.com/legal/affiliates), and [anyone requesting
information from etsy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/requests-for-information). [CLS] [SEP]

**search and advertising ranking disclosures.**
[this](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/search-advertisement-ranking-
disclosures/899478564529) is a concise summary of how etsy organizes search
results and advertising results that could include your content. [CLS] [SEP]

all of these policies are a part of our terms, so be sure to read the ones
that are relevant for you. [CLS] [SEP] of course, you’ll still want to read the rest of
this document because it applies to everyone!

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] your privacy

we know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to
us. [CLS] [SEP] our [privacy policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/privacy) details how your
information is used when you use our services. [CLS] [SEP] by using our services, you're
also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the
privacy policy, so please read it [here](https://www.etsy.com/legal/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

both etsy and sellers process members’ personal information (for example,
buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and are therefore considered
separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information
under eu law. [CLS] [SEP] that means that each party is responsible for the personal
information it processes in providing the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if a seller
accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling
another buyer’s order, the seller, not etsy, will be responsible for that
unauthorized disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]

if, however, etsy and sellers are found to be joint data controllers of
buyers’ personal information, and if etsy is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs
expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of buyer
personal information, you agree to indemnify etsy for the expenses it occurs
in connection with your processing of buyer personal information. [CLS] [SEP] see section
9. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification (or what happens if you get us sued) below for more
information about your indemnification obligations to etsy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] your account with etsy

you’ll need to create an account with etsy to use some of our services. [CLS] [SEP] here
are a few rules about accounts with etsy:

**a. [CLS] [SEP] you must be 18 years or older to use our services.** minors under 18 and
at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our services through an
account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission
and under their direct supervision. [CLS] [SEP] children under 13 years are not permitted
to use etsy or the services. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for any and all account
activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be commercial
products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a
minor's access to material online. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, see etsy's [minors
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/minors). [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] be honest with us.** provide accurate information about yourself. [CLS] [SEP] it’s
prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or company
through your account. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] choose an appropriate name.** if you decide to not have your full name
serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use language that
is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual property rights, or
otherwise violates the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] you're responsible for your account.** you’re solely responsible for any
activity on your account. [CLS] [SEP] if you’re sharing an account with other people, then
the person whose financial information is on the account will ultimately be
responsible for all activity. [CLS] [SEP] if you’re registering as a business entity, you
personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the terms on
behalf of the business. [CLS] [SEP] also, your accounts are not transferable. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] protect your password.** as we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible
for any activity on your account, so it’s important to keep your account
password secure. [CLS] [SEP] [here’s a help article on how to make your account more
secure](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015569567). [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] let's be clear about our relationship.** these terms don't create any
agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship
between you and etsy. [CLS] [SEP]

[this detailed help article](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-
us/articles/115015568007) should answer any questions you may have about
registering an account with etsy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] your content

content that you post using our services is your content (so let’s refer to it
as “your content”). [CLS] [SEP] we don’t make any claim to it, which includes anything you
post using our services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos,
listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

**a. [CLS] [SEP] responsibility for your content.** you understand that you are solely
responsible for your content. [CLS] [SEP] you represent that you have all necessary rights
to your content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s
rights by posting it. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] permission to use your content**. [CLS] [SEP] by posting your content through our
services, you grant etsy a license to use it. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t claim any ownership to
your content, but we have your permission to use it to help etsy function and
grow. [CLS] [SEP] that way, we won’t infringe any rights you have in your content and we
can help promote it. [CLS] [SEP] . [CLS] [SEP] for example, you acknowledge and agree etsy may offer
you or etsy buyers promotions on the site, from time to time, that may relate
to your listings

**c. [CLS] [SEP] rights you grant etsy.** (here’s the legalese version of the last
section). [CLS] [SEP] by posting your content, you grant etsy a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display,
edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of
your content. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to provide the services and to promote etsy, your
etsy shop, or the services in general, in any formats and through any
channels, including across any etsy services, our partners, or third-party
website or advertising medium. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to assert any moral rights or
rights of publicity against us for using your content. [CLS] [SEP] you also recognize our
legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license,
to the extent your content contains any personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

that sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to keep etsy going. [CLS] [SEP] consider
these examples: if you upload a photo or video of a listing on your etsy shop,
we have permission to display it to buyers, and we can resize or enhance it so
it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if you post a description in
english, we can translate it into french so a buyer in paris can learn the
story behind your item; and if you post a beautiful photo or video of your
latest handmade necklace, we can feature it– often along with your shop name
and shop picture– on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard
to help promote your business and etsy’s. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] reporting unauthorized content.** etsy has great respect for intellectual
property rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to
remove infringing content from the services. [CLS] [SEP] if content that you own or have
rights to has been posted to the services without your permission and you want
it removed, please follow the steps listed in our [intellectual property
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/ip). [CLS] [SEP] if your content is alleged to infringe
another person’s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such
as disabling it if we receive proper notice or terminating your account if you
are found to be a repeat infringer. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll notify you if any of that happens. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] inappropriate, false, or misleading content.** this should be common
sense, but there are certain types of content we don’t want posted on etsy’s
services (for legal reasons or otherwise). [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you will not post
any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or
otherwise offensive or in violation of our [prohibited items
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/prohibited), [community
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/community), or any part of our terms. [CLS] [SEP] you
also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the
services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] your use of our services

**license to use our services.** we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, and revocable license to use our services—subject to the terms
and the following restrictions in particular:

**a. [CLS] [SEP] don’t use our services to break the law.** you agree that you will not
violate any laws in connection with your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] this includes
any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your
shop requires, and to meet applicable legal requirements in applicable
jurisdiction(s). [CLS] [SEP] this includes the sale and delivery of your items, such as
age verification upon delivery, where required by law. [CLS] [SEP] you may not [sell
anything that violates any laws](https://www.etsy.com/legal/prohibited); you
must comply with our [sanctions
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/sanctions-policy/122383404929), and
you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices),
theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful
acts or crimes against etsy, another etsy user, or a third party. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] pay your bills.** you are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to
etsy. [CLS] [SEP] except as set forth below, you are also solely responsible for
collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases or sales you
make through our services. [CLS] [SEP] for digital items sold to buyers in australia,
belarus, chile, the eu, iceland, india, indonesia, japan, malaysia, mexico,
moldova, new zealand, norway, quebec (canada), russia, saudi arabia, serbia,
singapore, south africa, south korea, switzerland, taiwan, turkey, united arab
emirates or the united kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] etsy will help collect and remit the correct
amount of value-added tax or vat. [CLS] [SEP] some countries may refer to vat using other
terms, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] goods and services tax (gst), but we’ll just refer to vat, gst,
and any local sales taxes collectively as “vat.” in addition, etsy will
calculate, collect, and remit sales tax where applicable. [CLS] [SEP] please see [this
faq](https://help.etsy.com/hc/articles/360000343968) for more information. [CLS] [SEP]
your fees, bills, taxes, and how you can pay them are fully explained in our
[fees & payments policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees). [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] don’t steal our stuff.** you agree not to crawl, scrape, or spider any
page of the services or to reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source
code of the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to use our api, please follow our [api terms
of use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/api). [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] don’t try to harm our systems.** you agree not to interfere with or try
to disrupt our services, for example by distributing a virus or other harmful
computer code. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] follow our trademark policy.** the name "etsy" and the other etsy marks,
phrases, logos, and designs that we use in connection with our services (the
etsy trademarks), are trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of etsy in the
us and other countries. [CLS] [SEP] if you’d like to use our trademarks, please follow our
[trademark policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/trademarks). [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] share your ideas.** we love your suggestions and ideas! they can help us
improve your experience and our services. [CLS] [SEP] any unsolicited ideas or other
materials you submit to etsy (not including your content or items you sell
through our services) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to
you. [CLS] [SEP] you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-
licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for
any purpose, without compensation to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**g. [CLS] [SEP] talk to us online.** from time to time, etsy will provide you with
certain legal information in writing. [CLS] [SEP] by using our services, you’re agreeing
to our [electronic communications
policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/electronic-communications), which describes
how we provide that information to you. [CLS] [SEP] it says that we can send you
information electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper
copies (it’s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement
is the same as your signature on paper. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] termination

**termination by you.** we'd hate to see you go, but you may terminate your
account with etsy at any time from your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] you can find more
information in [this help article](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-
us/articles/115015693707). [CLS] [SEP] terminating your account will not affect the
availability of some of your content that you posted through the services
prior to termination. [CLS] [SEP] oh, and you’ll still have to pay any outstanding bills. [CLS] [SEP]

**termination by etsy.** we may terminate or suspend your account (and any
accounts etsy determines are related to your account) and your access to the
services should we have reason to believe you, your content, or your use of
the services violate our terms. [CLS] [SEP] if we do so, it’s important to understand that
you don’t have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our services,
for example, to sell or buy on our websites or mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP] generally, etsy
will notify you that your account has been terminated or suspended, unless
you’ve repeatedly violated our terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons
preventing us from notifying you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you or etsy terminate your account, you may lose any information associated
with your account, including your content. [CLS] [SEP]

**we may discontinue the services** etsy reserves the right to change,
suspend, or discontinue any of the services for you, any or all users, at any
time, for any reason, including those laid out in etsy’s policies under these
terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] we will not be liable to you for the effect that any changes to
the services may have on you, including your income or your ability to
generate revenue through the services. [CLS] [SEP]

**survival.** the terms will remain in effect even after your access to the
service is terminated, or your use of the service ends. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] warranties and limitation of liability (or the things you can’t sue us
for)

**items you purchase.** you understand that etsy does not manufacture, store,
or inspect any of the items sold through our services. [CLS] [SEP] we provide the venue;
the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by
independent sellers, so etsy cannot and does not make any warranties about
their quality, safety, or even their legality. [CLS] [SEP] any legal claim related to an
item you purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the item. [CLS] [SEP] you
release etsy from any claims related to items sold through our services,
including for defective items, misrepresentations by sellers, or items that
caused physical injury (like product liability claims). [CLS] [SEP]

**content you access.** you may come across materials that you find offensive
or inappropriate while using our services. [CLS] [SEP] we make no representations
concerning any content posted by users through the services. [CLS] [SEP] etsy is not
responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of
content posted by users that you accessed through the services. [CLS] [SEP] you release us
from all liability relating to that content. [CLS] [SEP]

**people you interact with.** you can use the services to interact with other
individuals, either online or in person. [CLS] [SEP] however, you understand that we do
not screen users of our services, and you release us from all liability
relating to your interactions with other users. [CLS] [SEP] please be careful and exercise
caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, especially if you
are meeting someone in person. [CLS] [SEP] [this help
article](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/personal-safety-when-meeting-
members-in/243317335177) has some good advice about handling in person
meetings. [CLS] [SEP]

**third-party services.** our services may contain links to third-party
websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to
facebook, twitter, and pinterest). [CLS] [SEP] you may also need to use a third party’s
product or service in order to use some of our services (like a compatible
mobile device to use our mobile apps). [CLS] [SEP] when you access these third-party
services, you do so at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] the third parties may require you to
accept their own terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] etsy is not a party to those agreements; they
are solely between you and the third party. [CLS] [SEP]

**gift cards and promotions.** you acknowledge that etsy does not make any
warranties with respect to your gift card balance and is not responsible for
any unauthorized access to, or alteration, theft, or destruction of a gift
card or gift card code that results from any action by you or a third party. [CLS] [SEP]
you also acknowledge that we may suspend or prohibit use of your gift card if
your gift card or gift card code has been reported lost or stolen, or if we
believe your gift card balance is being used suspiciously, fraudulently, or in
an otherwise unauthorized manner. [CLS] [SEP] if your gift card code stops working, your
only remedy is for us to issue you a replacement gift card code. [CLS] [SEP] by
participating in a special offer or promotion, you agree that you may not
later claim that the rules of that special offer or promotion were ambiguous. [CLS] [SEP]

**warranties.** etsy is dedicated to making our services the best they can be,
but we’re not perfect and sometimes things can go wrong. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that
our services are provided “as is” and without any kind of warranty (express or
implied). [CLS] [SEP] we are expressly disclaiming any warranties of title, non-
infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well
as any warranties implied by a course of performance, course of dealing, or
usage of trade. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not guarantee that: (i) the services will be secure or available at any
particular time or location; (ii) any defects or errors will be corrected;
(iii) the services will be free of viruses or other harmful materials; or (iv)
the results of using the services will meet your expectations. [CLS] [SEP] you use the
services solely at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow limitations
on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

liability limits. [CLS] [SEP] to the fullest extent permitted by law, neither etsy, nor
our employees or directors shall be liable to you for any lost profits or
revenues, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive
damages arising out of or in connection with the services or these terms. [CLS] [SEP] in
no event shall etsy’s aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater
of one hundred ($100) us dollars (usd) or the amount you paid etsy in the past
twelve months. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
---  
  
## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification (or what happens if you get us sued)

we hope this never happens, but if etsy gets sued because of something that
you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. [CLS] [SEP] that means you’ll defend etsy
(including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or
demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions,
your use (or misuse) of our services, your breach of the terms, or you or your
account’s infringement of someone else’s rights. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if
you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we
can execute our strategy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] disputes with other users

if you find yourself in a dispute with another user of etsy’s services or a
third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve
the dispute amicably. [CLS] [SEP]

**case system.** buyers and sellers who are unable to resolve a dispute
related to a transaction on our websites or mobile apps may participate in our
case system. [CLS] [SEP] you can find details about the case system in [this help
article](https://help.etsy.com/hc/articles/115013294548). [CLS] [SEP] etsy will attempt to
help you resolve disputes in good faith and based solely on our interpretation
of our policies, in our sole discretion; we will not make judgments regarding
legal issues or claims. [CLS] [SEP] etsy has no obligation to resolve any disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

**release of etsy.** you release etsy from any claims, demands, and damages
arising out of disputes with other users or parties. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] disputes with etsy

if you’re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. [CLS] [SEP]
but if we can’t, then these rules will govern any legal dispute involving our
services:

**a. [CLS] [SEP] governing law.** the terms are governed by the laws of the state of new
york, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the united
states of america. [CLS] [SEP] these laws will apply no matter where in the world you
live, but if you live outside of the united states, you may be entitled to the
protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local
consumer protection law. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration.** you and etsy agree that any dispute or claim arising from
or relating to the terms shall be finally settled by final and binding
arbitration, using the english language, administered by the american
arbitration association (the “aaa”) under its consumer arbitration rules (the
"aaa rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by
reference into this section, and as of the date of these terms you can find
the aaa rules
[here](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/consumer_arbitration_rules_web.pdf)),
unless otherwise required by law. [CLS] [SEP] **arbitration, including threshold questions
of arbitrability of the dispute, will be handled by a sole arbitrator in
accordance with those rules. [CLS] [SEP] judgment on the arbitration award may be entered
in any court that has jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

for eu sellers, if any dispute arises in connection with the terms, the
parties should first try to resolve the dispute through the complaints
procedure published [here](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-
gb/articles/360051541413). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, the dispute may be referred by either
party to the centre for effective dispute resolution (“cedr”) for mediation. [CLS] [SEP]
the parties agree to enter into mediation to settle a good faith dispute and
will do so in accordance with the cedr’s mediation procedures. [CLS] [SEP] unless
otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of notice of the dispute,
the mediator will be nominated by cedr. [CLS] [SEP] to initiate the mediation a party must
give notice in writing to the other party to the dispute, referring the
dispute to mediation. [CLS] [SEP] a copy of the referral should be sent to cedr. [CLS] [SEP]

any arbitration or mediation under the terms will take place on an individual
basis. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that by agreeing to the terms, you and etsy are each
waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action
lawsuit. [CLS] [SEP] class arbitrations shall only be available if requested by either
party under its class action arbitration rules and approved by the arbitration
entity. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to
bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other
equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator
or mediator. [CLS] [SEP] you may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but
only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim
remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] costs of arbitration.** payment for any and all reasonable aaa filing,
administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the consumer
arbitration rules, and in the case of cedr, its rules. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of your
claim does not exceed $10,000 usd, etsy will pay for the reasonable filing,
administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless
the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. [CLS] [SEP] for mediation through
cedr, the parties will pay their share of mediation costs, and under certain
conditions such fees may be refundable to you, depending on the outcome of the
mediation. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] forum.** we’re based in new york, so any legal action against etsy
related to our services must be filed and take place in new york county, new
york. [CLS] [SEP] for all actions under the aaa rules, the proceedings may be filed where
your residence is, or in new york, new york, and any in-person hearings will
be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties
taking into account their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]
for any actions not subject to arbitration or mediation, you and etsy agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court located in new
york county, new york if your contract is with etsy, inc.; if your contract is
with etsy ireland uc, you and etsy agree to submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of ireland. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] government exception.** if you are a government agent or entity in the
united states using the services in your official capacity, and you are
legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do
not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, the terms and any action related to the terms
will be governed by the laws of the united states (without reference to
conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent
permitted under federal law, the laws of the state of new york. [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] modifications.** if we make any changes to this “disputes with etsy”
section after the date you last accepted the terms, those changes will not
apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against etsy prior to the date
the changes became effective. [CLS] [SEP] etsy will notify you of substantive changes to
the “disputes with etsy” section at least 30 days prior to the date the change
will become effective. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send
etsy a written notification (including email) or close your account within
those 30 days. [CLS] [SEP] by rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your
account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and etsy in
accordance with the provisions of this “disputes with etsy” section as of the
date you last accepted the terms, including any changes made prior to your
rejection. [CLS] [SEP] if you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you
agree to be bound by the current version of the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to the terms

we may update these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we believe that the changes
are material, we’ll definitely let you know by posting the changes through the
services and/or sending you an email or message about the changes. [CLS] [SEP] that way
you can decide whether you want to continue using the services. [CLS] [SEP] changes will
be effective upon the posting of the changes unless otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP] you
are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. [CLS] [SEP] your use
of the services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the
updated terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] some finer legal points

the terms, including all of the policies that make up the terms, supersede any
other agreement between you and etsy regarding the services. [CLS] [SEP] if any part of
the terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the
minimum extent necessary so that the terms will otherwise remain in full force
and effect. [CLS] [SEP] our failure to enforce any part of the terms is not a waiver of
our right to later enforce that or any other part of the terms. [CLS] [SEP] we may assign
any of our rights and obligations under the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] contact information

if you have any questions about the terms, please email us at
[legal@etsy.com](mailto:legal@etsy.com). [CLS] [SEP]

*in some countries you may have additional rights and/or the preceding may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]
