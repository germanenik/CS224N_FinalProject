#  privacy policy

phone2action is committed to protecting your privacy and all data on our
networks. [CLS] [SEP] please find the phone2action privacy policy below. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any
questions about data security, or if you believe you have discovered an issue,
please [contact us immediately via this web
form](https://phone2action.com/security-request/). [CLS] [SEP]

 **phone2action privacy policy  
** **effective as of january 1, 2020**

phone2action, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (the “company”, “we”, “us”, “ours”) is committed to
protecting your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] we have prepared this privacy notice (or “notice”) to
describe to you our practices regarding our collection and use of your
personal data (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy notice provides information
about the types of information we collect from our services and website and
what we may do with that information. [CLS] [SEP]

in this notice, we will outline and describe the following with respect to the
personal data that we collect:

  * what information we collect
  * how we collect it
  * how we use it
  * with whom we share your information
  * what we disclose internationally
  * how long we keep your information
  * your rights under the law
  * the security of your information
  * our data privacy officer
  * our policy regarding children
  * information for california residents

you will note that throughout this notice we use words that are capitalized. [CLS] [SEP]
these are special terms that are defined. [CLS] [SEP] those definitions are set forth at
the end of this notice, in section xii. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _i. [CLS] [SEP] what information we collect_**

 ** _a. [CLS] [SEP] information you provide_ :**

if you are just browsing the phone2action website, we do not ask you to enter
any personal information about yourself unless you complete a company form. [CLS] [SEP] if
you wish to take action in any campaigns powered by our technology, the
personal information that you provide can include your name, title, physical
address (including zip code), email address, and phone number. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect
information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of our
platform, which may include photos, your personal comments and positions on
topics, which could include political information and other information of a
sensitive nature that you choose to submit. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect your user
name, or handle, from facebook or twitter when you connect to us from them or
wish to connect to them from us. [CLS] [SEP] we may also combine information you provide
with personal data we collect automatically (as further described in part i,
section b below) and with data we receive from third-parties. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
associate information you provide with information we collect about you from
different devices, browsers and platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _b. [CLS] [SEP] information collected automatically_ :**

certain information that identifies you may be passively collected and stored
on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your internet protocol
(“ **ip** ”) address, browser type, operating system and information regarding
what website pages you accessed and when. [CLS] [SEP] an ip address is a number that is
automatically assigned to your computer when you use the internet. [CLS] [SEP] in some
cases your ip address stays the same from browser session to browser session;
but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your ip address may vary
from session to session. [CLS] [SEP] we also use cookies and navigational data like
uniform resource locators (“ **url** ”) to gather information regarding the
date and time of your visit to our website or access to our platform through a
campaign, and the information for which you searched and viewed. [CLS] [SEP] this type of
information is collected to make our services more useful to you and our
clients, and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests
and needs. [CLS] [SEP]

“ **cookies** ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your
devices while you are viewing a website. [CLS] [SEP] we may use both session cookies
(which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which
stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a better
experience with our platform. [CLS] [SEP] persistent cookies can be removed by following
your internet browser directions. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to disable cookies, some
aspects of our services may perform differently, for instance, you will need
to re-enter your information each time you return to use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not offer third-party advertising on our website, therefore we do not
respond to “do not track signals” or other mechanisms that might enable
website visitors to opt out of tracking on the phone2action site. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
by using our website and agreeing to this policy, **you consent to our use of
cookies** in accordance with the terms of this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _c. [CLS] [SEP] information collected from third-parties_ :**

in addition to the information that we collect as described above, we also
collect information about you from our third-party integrators and vendors. [CLS] [SEP]
these parties are used by us to run our platform and integrate our services
with our clients, so that you can take action and participate in campaigns
through our platform. [CLS] [SEP] the information that we collect through these channels
includes your geo location data, derived from the address that you submit,
legislative data, such as your legislative or political district, candidate
and elected official information, voter registration and polling location. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _ii. [CLS] [SEP] how we collect your information_** ****

we collect your personal data in a number of ways, and this section will
describe those methods. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _a. [CLS] [SEP] your direct interaction with us_** : we collect your personal data
when you interact directly with us by coming to our website to browse or to
enter information in a campaign that uses our platform. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _b. [CLS] [SEP] from our clients_** : another way we collect your personal data is
from our clients who contract with us to use phone2action services. [CLS] [SEP] if you
provide your information via a campaign that uses our platform, we will
collect the information you provide on the form such as name, e-mail address
and the full content of your message, including attached files, and other
information you provide. [CLS] [SEP] this method of personal data submission to us could
occur **(i)** , for instance if you complete a form created by a client but
powered by phone2action, or **(ii)** where the client captures the data you
enter and then transmits that data to us. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _c. [CLS] [SEP] from third-party technologies and social network sites_ :**

we may receive personal data about you from other sources with which you have
interacted, such as through third-party technologies that are integrated into
the services like alexa, which is owned by amazon, or through social networks
like facebook or twitter when you grant us permission to access these
technologies to further use phone2action services. [CLS] [SEP] further, we may associate
this personal data obtained from these sources with the other personal data we
have collected about you from other sources as described in this notice. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not control or supervise how these third-parties process your personal data,
and any information request that you have regarding the disclosure of your
personal data from them to us should be made directly to those third-parties. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _d. [CLS] [SEP] third-party analytics_ : **

third-parties who provide us with analytics services for our platform and
services may collect some of the information described in section i,
including, for example, ip address, access times, browser type and language,
device type, device identifiers and wi-fi information. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we use
google analytics and similar services to perform certain analytical tasks
about our web user’s activities. [CLS] [SEP] we use the user-id feature of google
analytics to combine behavioral information across devices and sessions
(including authenticated and unauthenticated sessions). [CLS] [SEP]

 **iii. [CLS] [SEP] _how we use your information and the legal basis for sharing it_**

we may use your information to:

  * process information you have submitted on a form either through one of our client’s campaign forms on a phone2action website form; via text message, voice recognition, conversational messaging system, or via phone call. [CLS] [SEP]
  * seek your views or comments on the services we provide;
  * send you marketing materials and information about other phone2action products with your consent;
  * carry out our obligations arising from our website’s terms of use, or arising from any contracts entered into by us with our clients;
  * provide, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment and comply with our legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

applicable laws require us to have a “legal basis” for using and sharing your
information. [CLS] [SEP] these legal bases include the following:

  * your consent - to fulfill your express requests. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to carry out our legitimate interests in our platform. [CLS] [SEP] “legitimate interests” is a concept in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your personal data and we do so only if our interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms. [CLS] [SEP] we sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to fulfill our obligations with you when the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to measure the adequate performance of our interactions with you, and to comply with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to promote the safety and security of the services, our users, and other parties. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may use the information to protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _iv. [CLS] [SEP] how we share your information_**

 **a. [CLS] [SEP] _with_ y _our consent_ :**

where you have provided express and unambiguous consent, we share your
personal data as described at the time of consent. [CLS] [SEP] this form of consent is
also given when you take action on a client campaign or when you sign a
petition. [CLS] [SEP] we do not otherwise share any of your personal data that identifies
you, except as instructed by you. [CLS] [SEP]

the specific ways in which you consent to share personal data that you provide
to us is when we enable you to send individual e-mails and related messages to
lawmakers, regulatory agencies, and other organizations and leaders that are
the target of a campaign through our platform. [CLS] [SEP] these messages may include your
full name, e-mail address, mailing address and other contact information you
may have provided as part of the submission. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for
the specific message(s) you send using our services. [CLS] [SEP]

for certain campaigns that you completed some of your information may be made
public, including without limitation your name, city, and state (“public
petition information”). [CLS] [SEP] all other information you have been asked to provide
will not be made public. [CLS] [SEP]

based on our legitimate interest to operate and promote our platform we may
display parts of the platform (e.g., a campaign web form and your postings on
it) on sites operated by our clients, using technologies such as widgets or
via apis. [CLS] [SEP] if your postings are displayed on a client’s site, information from
your posting may also be displayed. [CLS] [SEP]

information you share publicly through our platform may be indexed through
third party search engines, such as google or bing. [CLS] [SEP] we do not control the
practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing
your outdated information. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that personal data that you submit
when you take action on our platform through our website or services may be
available, via the internet, around the world. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot prevent the use (or
misuse) of such personal data by others. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _b. [CLS] [SEP] third-party sub-processors_ :**

we use third-party sub-processors (including contractors and service
providers) to provide the services and to help with our operations, which may
require that these sub-processors have access to and use your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, we may use a third-party to communicate with you (via telephone,
email, or sms) to provide customer support, to receive additional data about
you, and to perform analytics and other work that we may need to outsource. [CLS] [SEP]
the sub-processors are bound by law and/or contract to protect the
confidentiality and security of personal data, and to only process your
personal data to provide requested services and only act on our documented
instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _c. [CLS] [SEP] third-party websites_ :**

we may provide links to other websites, such as social network sites
(facebook, twitter) and other websites may provide links to our website. [CLS] [SEP]
third-party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy
policies. [CLS] [SEP] phone2action has no control over such third-party websites, and **by
using our platform and services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not
responsible for the availability of such third-party sites, and do not endorse
and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or
other materials on or available from such sites. [CLS] [SEP] you further acknowledge and
agree that phone2action will not be responsible or liable, directly or
indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in
connection with use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or
other materials on or available from such sites.**

 ** _d. [CLS] [SEP] de-identified information about you_ :**

we may also share aggregated or de-identified information (i.e., information
that does not personally identify you directly), or statistical information
about you, including statistical data and historical use data, with others for
a variety of purposes, including for their own uses, for example, for
improving their services for you and others, or for educational purposes. [CLS] [SEP] your
personal data will not be shared on an individual, identifiable basis under
these circumstances, nor can you ask us to restrict this type of sharing,
since it does not identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _e. [CLS] [SEP] as required by law or legitimate business interest_ : ******

in addition, we may disclose your personal data where such disclosure is
necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or
in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another
natural person. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, we may disclose your personal data to our
professional advisers as reasonably necessary for the purposes of managing
risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or
defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
or out-of-court procedure. [CLS] [SEP] also, we may share some or all of your personal
data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger or similar
transaction involving sale or transfer of some or all of our business or
assets. [CLS] [SEP] if another company acquires our company or assets, that company will
possess the personal data collected by us and will assume the rights and
obligations regarding your personal data as described in this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _v. [CLS] [SEP] we disclose your personal data internationally_**

 **a.** ** _our headquarters_ :**

our headquarters is in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] whether or not you live in the
united states, information we collect from you will be processed in the united
states. [CLS] [SEP] the united states has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy”
from foreign officials, including the european union under article 45 of the
gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] we rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in article
49 of the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, for eea residents, we collect and transfer to
the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] personal data only: (i) with your consent; (ii) to perform a contract
with you; (iii) to conclude or perform a contract with another person in the
furtherance of your or our legal interests (such as with a client); (iv) or to
fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of ours in a manner that does not
outweigh your rights and freedoms. [CLS] [SEP] we strive to apply suitable safeguards to
protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only
consistent with your relationship with phone2action and the practices
described in this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _b. [CLS] [SEP] third-parties_ :**

while many of our third party sub-processors are global companies with
operations in the eea, some of the third-party sub-processors with whom we
share personal data are located outside of the eea. [CLS] [SEP] certain third countries
have been officially recognized by the european commission as providing an
adequate level of protection. [CLS] [SEP] you can find the list of these countries at the
following address: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-
protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-
countries_en. [CLS] [SEP] transfers to third-parties located in other third countries
outside the eea take place using an acceptable data transfer mechanism, such
as the privacy shield for transfers to self-certified us organizations, the eu
standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, approved codes of
conduct and certifications or in exceptional circumstances on the basis of
permissible statutory derogations. [CLS] [SEP]

please contact our data privacy officer at the address or phone number listed
below, in section ix, if you want to receive further information about these
sub-processors. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _vi. [CLS] [SEP] how long we keep your personal data_**

your personal data is stored by us on the servers of the cloud-based database
management services that we engage, located in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] we retain
your personal data collected as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes
for which we collected it, and to comply with our legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP] personal
data of eea residents that remains inactive (you do not take any action or are
contacted within 1 full year) will be deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

in no event will we keep your personal data for longer than is strictly
necessary for the purposes defined in this notice. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on
where and how long your personal data is stored, please contact our data
privacy officer at the address or phone number listed below, in section ix. [CLS] [SEP]

 **vii. [CLS] [SEP] _your rights in relation to your personal data_**

 _ **a. [CLS] [SEP] for united states residents and others not living in the eea:** ****_

you have the rights provided under the laws applicable to where you live. [CLS] [SEP]
additionally, you can ask us questions about the personal data that we have
relating to you, ask us to correct any of that personal data if it is wrong
and you can verify that with us. [CLS] [SEP]

 _ **b. [CLS] [SEP] for residents of the eea:**_

if you reside within the eea, the gdpr applies. [CLS] [SEP] this law provides certain
rights for data subjects. [CLS] [SEP] under the conditions set by this law, you may be
able to exercise the following rights regarding your personal data, subject to
the exceptions provided by the gdpr (see also section ix on who to contact to
exercise those rights):

 **1\. [CLS] [SEP] access:**

you have the right to access your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] you can obtain from us
confirmation if personal data is being processed, the purpose of processing,
the categories of data, the legal basis of the processing, information on
recipients of the data and the non-eu countries in which they are located, and
the safeguards put in place for the transfer of data to non-eu countries. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have chosen to connect to a social network like facebook or twitter, you
can remove permission for the app by changing your account settings with them. [CLS] [SEP]
you are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP]

 **2\. [CLS] [SEP] rectification:**

you have the right to request us to correct inaccurate personal data and to
have incomplete data completed, but only to the extent that the data is still
under our control and has not yet been transmitted to a campaign or petition
target. [CLS] [SEP]

 **3\. [CLS] [SEP] objection:**

you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for
compelling and legitimate reasons relating to your particular situation,
except in cases where legal provisions expressly provide for that processing,
or when upon your initial request, the personal data has already been
transmitted by us to a target of a campaign or petition identified by you. [CLS] [SEP]

 **4\. [CLS] [SEP] portability:**

you may request your personal data that you have provided to us and which is
still retained by us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
format, and you have the right to request that we transmit it to other data
controllers or processors without hindrance. [CLS] [SEP] this right only exists if the
processing is based on your consent or on a contract between us, and the
processing is carried out by automated means. [CLS] [SEP]

 **5\. [CLS] [SEP] restriction:**

you may request to restrict processing of your personal data if: (i) you
contest the accuracy of it – for a period we need to verify your request; (ii)
the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of it and request
restriction instead; (iii) we no longer need it, but you tell us you need it
to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or (iv) you object to
processing based on public or legitimate interest – for a period we need to
verify your request. [CLS] [SEP] please note that this right is limited to the extent that
the data is still under our control and does not apply to any data that has
already been transmitted to a campaign or petition target at the time of your
request. [CLS] [SEP]

 **6\. [CLS] [SEP] erasure:**

you may request to have your personal data erased if: (i) it is no longer
necessary for the purposes for which we have collected it, (ii) you have
withdrawn your consent and no other legal ground for the processing exists,
(iii) you objected and no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing
exist, (iv) the processing is unlawful, or (v) erasure is required to comply
with a legal obligation. [CLS] [SEP] please note that this right is limited to the extent
that the data is still under our control and does not apply to any data that
has already been transmitted to a campaign or petition target at the time of
your request. [CLS] [SEP]

 **7\. [CLS] [SEP] right to lodge a complaint:**

you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in
particular in the eea member state of your residence, place of employment, or
the location where the issue that is the subject of the complaint occurred. [CLS] [SEP]

 **8\. [CLS] [SEP] right to refuse or withdraw consent:**

please note that in case we ask for your consent to certain processing, you
are free to refuse to give the consent and you can withdraw your consent at
any time without any adverse negative consequences. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you
withdraw your consent to the use of cookies, we cannot deny your use of the
website; however, as explained above in section 1. [CLS] [SEP] b., if you choose to
