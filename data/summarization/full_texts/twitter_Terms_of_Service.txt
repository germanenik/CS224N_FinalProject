what happens to your information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or
part of the services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not
limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these terms or
the[ twitter rules and policies](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-

including, without limitation, your license to use the services, except that
the following sections shall continue to apply: ii, iii, v, and vi. [CLS] [SEP] if you
believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following

termination of your account. [CLS] [SEP]



### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimers and limitations of liability

# the services are available "as-is"

your access to and use of the services or any content are at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP]
you understand and agree that the services are provided to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis. [CLS] [SEP] the âtwitter entitiesâ refers to
twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting
the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
twitter entities disclaim all warranties and conditions, whether express or
implied, of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-
infringement. [CLS] [SEP] the twitter entities make no warranty or representation and
disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy,
availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the services or any
content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm
that results from your access to or use of the services or any content; (iii)
the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content and other
communications maintained by the services; and (iv) whether the services will
meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-
free basis. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from
the twitter entities or through the services, will create any warranty or
representation not expressly made herein. [CLS] [SEP]  

# limitation of liability

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the twitter entities shall
not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive
damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses,
resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the
services; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the services,
including without limitation, any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of
other users or third parties; (iii) any content obtained from the services; or
(iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content. [CLS] [SEP]
in no event shall the aggregate liability of the twitter entities exceed the
greater of one hundred u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars (u.s. [CLS] [SEP] $100.00) or the amount you paid
twitter, if any, in the past six months for the services giving rise to the
claim. [CLS] [SEP] the limitations of this subsection shall apply to any theory of
liability, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including
negligence) or otherwise, and whether or not the twitter entities have been
informed of the possibility of any such damage, and even if a remedy set forth
herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP]  



### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] general

we may revise these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] the changes will not be
retroactive, and the most current version of the terms, which will always be
at [twitter.com/tos](https://twitter.com/en/tos), will govern our relationship
with you. [CLS] [SEP] we will try to notify you of material revisions, for example via a
service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP] by
continuing to access or use the services after those revisions become
effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. [CLS] [SEP]  

the laws of the state of california, excluding its choice of law provisions,
will govern these terms and any dispute that arises between you and twitter. [CLS] [SEP]
all disputes related to these terms or the services will be brought solely in
the federal or state courts located in san francisco county, california,
united states, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any
objection as to inconvenient forum. [CLS] [SEP]  

if you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the united states
using the services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the
controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do
not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] for such u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal government entities, these terms and
any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the united states
of america (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of
federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the
state of california (excluding choice of law). [CLS] [SEP]

in the event that any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these terms will
remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] twitterâs failure to enforce any right or
provision of these terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or
provision. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms are an agreement between you and twitter, inc., 1355 market
street, suite 900, san francisco, ca 94103 u.s.a. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions
about these terms, please contact [us](https://help.twitter.com/forms "contact

what happens to your information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or
part of the services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not

the[ twitter rules and policies](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-
