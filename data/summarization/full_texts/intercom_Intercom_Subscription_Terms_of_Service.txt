working or function improperly and that intercom will have no responsibility
for the impact of any such customer changes. [CLS] [SEP]

2.6. [CLS] [SEP] **contractors and affiliates.** customer may permit its contractors and
its affiliates' employees and contractors to serve as permitted users,

of the services, intercom reserves the right to place limits on access to such
apis (e.g., limits on numbers of calls or requests). [CLS] [SEP] further, intercom may
monitor customer's usage of such apis and limit the number of calls or
requests customer may make if intercom believes that customer's usage is in
breach of this agreement or may negatively affect the services (or otherwise
impose liability on intercom). [CLS] [SEP]

2.9. [CLS] [SEP] **trial subscriptions.** if customer receives free access or a trial or

intercom will have no liability under this agreement for sensitive personal

c) compliance with laws. [CLS] [SEP] customer agrees to comply with all applicable laws in
its use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

2003 or any other anti-spam laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

d) disclosures on customer properties. [CLS] [SEP] customer acknowledges that the intercom
code causes a unique cookie id to be associated with each person who accesses
the customer properties, which cookie id enables intercom to provide the
services. [CLS] [SEP] customer will include on each customer property a link to its
privacy policy that discloses customer's use of third party tracking
technology to collect data about people as described in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]
customer's privacy policy must disclose how, and for what purposes, the data
collected through intercom code will be used or shared with intercom as part
of the services. [CLS] [SEP] customer must also provide people with clear and
comprehensive information about the storing and accessing of cookies or other
information on the peoples' devices where such activity occurs in connection
with the services and as required by applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, as between
customer and intercom, customer will be solely responsible for obtaining the
necessary clearances, consents and approvals from people under all applicable
laws. [CLS] [SEP]

e) social media data. [CLS] [SEP]

i. [CLS] [SEP] _fullcontact; opt-out_. [CLS] [SEP] the services use third-party services provided by

publicly-available information about people including without limitation
social media information, profile information, gender, company, job titles,
photos, physical addresses, and website urls (" **social media data** ") based
on people's email addresses input into the services. [CLS] [SEP] fullcontact uses people's
email addresses as described in its privacy policy, available at
<https://www.fullcontact.com/privacy/>. [CLS] [SEP] customer may opt out of having
people's email addresses sent to fullcontact via the dashboard. [CLS] [SEP]

ii. [CLS] [SEP] _restrictions_.customer agrees not to use any social media data obtained
via the services for the purposes of cookie tracking, ad exchanges, ad

identified as prohibited by intercom from time to time. [CLS] [SEP]

iii. [CLS] [SEP] _disclosures_.customer agrees to obtain all necessary clearances,
consents and approvals from people in order to use social media data as
required under all applicable laws, including without limitation by disclosing
in customer's privacy policy information about the collection and use of
people's email addresses as set forth in this section. [CLS] [SEP]

3.4. [CLS] [SEP] **indemnification by customer.** customer will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless intercom from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs)
arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to any
customer data or breach or alleged breach by customer of section 3.3 (customer
obligations). [CLS] [SEP] this indemnification obligation is subject to customer receiving
(i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient
time for customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to
control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim;
and (iii) all necessary cooperation of intercom at customer's expense. [CLS] [SEP]
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (a) intercom may participate in the
defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense
and (b) customer will not settle any claim without intercom's prior written
consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases intercom and
does not require intercom to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any
liability. [CLS] [SEP]

3.5. [CLS] [SEP] **aggregated anonymous data** . [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, customer agrees that intercom may obtain and aggregate technical and
other data about customer's use of the services that is non-personally
identifiable with respect to customer (" **aggregated anonymous data** "), and
intercom may use the aggregated anonymous data to analyze, improve, support
and operate the services and otherwise for any business purpose during and
after the term of this agreement, including without limitation to generate
industry benchmark or best practice guidance, recommendations or similar
reports for distribution to and consumption by customer and other intercom
customers. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, this section 3.5 does not give intercom the right to
identify customer as the source of any aggregated anonymous data. [CLS] [SEP]

3.6. [CLS] [SEP] **eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield.** this section 3.6 applies only if customer has
entered into this agreement with intercom, inc. [CLS] [SEP] as set forth above. [CLS] [SEP] intercom,
inc. [CLS] [SEP] participates in the eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework. [CLS] [SEP] for more

intercom agrees to use commercially reasonable technical and organizational
measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or
disclosure of any service or customer data. [CLS] [SEP] however, intercom will have no
responsibility for errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or
other causes beyond intercom's control. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5. [CLS] [SEP] third-party platforms

the services may support integrations with certain third-party platforms. [CLS] [SEP] in
order for the services to communicate with such third-party platforms,
customer may be required to input credentials in order for the services to
access and receive relevant information from such third-party platforms. [CLS] [SEP] by
enabling use of the services with any third-party platform, customer
authorizes intercom to access customer's accounts with such third-party
platform for the purposes described in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] customer is solely
responsible for complying with any relevant terms and conditions of the third-
party platforms and maintaining appropriate accounts in good standing with the
providers of the third-party platforms. [CLS] [SEP] customer acknowledges and agrees that
intercom has no responsibility or liability for any third-party platform or
any customer data exported to a third-party platform. [CLS] [SEP] intercom does not
guarantee that the services will maintain integrations with any third-party
platform and intercom may disable integrations of the services with any third-
party platform at any time with or without notice to customer. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity,
this agreement governs customer's use of and access to the services, even if
accessed through an integration with a third-party platform. [CLS] [SEP]

copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in

7.2. [CLS] [SEP] **fees and payment** . [CLS] [SEP] all fees are as set forth in the applicable order

an automatic adjustment increase of up to ten percent (10%) per year. [CLS] [SEP] customer
is responsible for paying all taxes, and all taxes are excluded from any fees
set forth in the applicable order form. [CLS] [SEP] if customer is required by law to
withhold any taxes from customer's payment, the fees payable by customer will
be increased as necessary so that after making any required withholdings,
intercom receives and retains (free from any liability for payment of taxes)
an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such withholdings

related services) without liability to customer until such amounts are paid in

information in its possession. [CLS] [SEP] provided this agreement was not terminated for
customer's breach, customer may retain and use internally copies of all
reports exported from any service prior to termination. [CLS] [SEP] customer acknowledges
that following termination it will have no further access to any customer data
input into any service, and that intercom may delete any such data as may have
been stored by intercom at any time. [CLS] [SEP] except where an exclusive remedy is

9.1. [CLS] [SEP] **limited warranty** . [CLS] [SEP] intercom warrants, for customer's benefit only,
that each service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable
documentation. [CLS] [SEP] intercom's sole liability (and customer's sole and exclusive
remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to customer, for
intercom to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-
conformity, or if intercom determines such remedy to be impracticable, either
party may terminate the applicable subscription term and customer will receive
as its sole remedy a refund of any fees customer has pre-paid for use of such
service for the terminated portion of the applicable subscription term. [CLS] [SEP] the
limited warranty set forth in this section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless
customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which customer
first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse,
unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or
(iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis. [CLS] [SEP]

9.2. [CLS] [SEP] **warranty disclaimer** . [CLS] [SEP] except for the limited warranty in section 9.1,
all services and professional services are provided "as is". [CLS] [SEP] neither intercom
nor its suppliers makes any other warranties, express or implied, statutory or
otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, title,
fitness for a particular purpose or noninfringement. [CLS] [SEP] intercom does not warrant
that customer's use of the services will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor
does intercom warrant that it will review the customer data for accuracy or
that it will preserve or maintain the customer data without loss or
corruption. [CLS] [SEP] intercom shall not be liable for the results of any communications
sent or any communications that were failed to be sent using the services. [CLS] [SEP]
intercom shall not be liable for delays, interruptions, service failures or
other problems inherent in use of the internet and electronic communications,
third-party platforms or other systems outside the reasonable control of
intercom. [CLS] [SEP] customer may have other statutory rights, but the duration of
statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the shortest
period permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10. [CLS] [SEP] availability and service credits

agreement.](https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#sla) (" **sla** "). [CLS] [SEP]

during the subscription term of each service, intercom will provide end user
support in accordance with intercom's [support
policy](https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#support-policy) ("
**support policy** "). [CLS] [SEP]

## 12. [CLS] [SEP] professional services

intercom will provide the professional consulting services (" **professional
services** ") purchased in the applicable order form. [CLS] [SEP] the scope of
professional services will be as set forth in a statement of work referencing
this agreement and executed by both parties describing the work to be
performed, fees and any applicable milestones, dependencies and other
technical specifications or related information (" **sow** "). [CLS] [SEP] unless
professional services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, customer will pay
intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the order form (or, if not
specified, at intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services. [CLS] [SEP]
customer will reimburse intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as
incurred. [CLS] [SEP] customer may use anything delivered as part of the professional
services in support of authorized use of the services and subject to the terms
regarding customer's rights to use the service set forth in section 2
(intercom services) and the applicable sow, but intercom will retain all
right, title and interest in and to any such work product, code or
deliverables and any derivative, enhancement or modification thereof created
by intercom (or its agents). [CLS] [SEP]

## 13. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of remedies and damages

13.1. [CLS] [SEP] **consequential damages waiver.** except for excluded claims (defined
below), neither party (nor its suppliers) shall have any liability arising out
of or related to this agreement for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits,
failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business, or any indirect,
special, incidental, reliance, or consequential damages of any kind, even if
informed of the possibility of such damages in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

13.2. [CLS] [SEP] **liability cap.** intercom's and its suppliers' entire liability to
customer arising out of or related to this agreement shall not exceed the
amount actually paid by customer to intercom during the prior twelve (12)
months under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

13.3. [CLS] [SEP] **excluded claims.** " **excluded claims** " means any claim arising (a)
from customer's breach of section 2.7 (general restrictions); (b) under
section 3.3 (customer obligations) or 3.4 (indemnification by customer); or
(c) from a party's breach of its obligations in section 15 (confidential
information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of
any service). [CLS] [SEP]

13.4. [CLS] [SEP] **nature of claims and failure of essential purpose**. [CLS] [SEP] the parties agree
that the waivers and limitations specified in this section 13 apply regardless
of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict
liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy
specified in this agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

## 14. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification

intercom will defend customer from and against any claim by a third party
alleging that a service when used as authorized under this agreement infringes
a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] patent, u.s. [CLS] [SEP] copyright, or u.s. [CLS] [SEP] trademark and will indemnify and hold
harmless customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded
against customer or agreed in settlement by intercom (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that intercom will have
received from customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any
event notice in sufficient time for intercom to respond without prejudice);
(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and
settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary
cooperation of customer. [CLS] [SEP] if customer's use of a service is (or in intercom's
opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if intercom
determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability,
intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially
functionally similar products or services; (b) procure for customer the right
to continue using such service; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially
reasonable, (c) terminate this agreement and refund to customer the fees paid
by customer for the portion of the subscription term that was paid by customer
but not rendered by intercom. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing indemnification obligation of
intercom will not apply: (1) if such service is modified by any party other
than intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by
such modification; (2) if such service is combined with products or processes
not provided by intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is
caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of such service; (4)
to any action arising as a result of customer data or any third-party
deliverables or components contained within such service; (5) to the extent
the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or
implementation of the service but instead by features common to any similar
product or service; or (6) if customer settles or makes any admissions with
respect to a claim without intercom's prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] this section 14
sets forth intercom's and its suppliers' sole liability and customer's sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any claim of intellectual property
infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15. [CLS] [SEP] confidential information

each party (as " **receiving party** ") agrees that all code, inventions,
know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the
disclosing party (" **disclosing party** ") constitute the confidential
property of the disclosing party (" **confidential information** "), provided
that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be
reasonably known by the receiving party to be confidential or proprietary due
to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding
the disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] any intercom technology, performance information relating to
any service, and the terms and conditions of this agreement will be deemed
confidential information of intercom without any marking or further
designation. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly authorized herein, the receiving party will
(1) hold in confidence and not disclose any confidential information to third
parties and (2) not use confidential information for any purpose other than
fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the
receiving party may disclose confidential information to its employees,
agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know
(including, for intercom, the subcontractors referenced in section 17.8
(subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to
confidentiality obligations no less protective of the disclosing party than
this section 15 and that the receiving party remains responsible for
compliance by any such representative with the terms of this section 15. [CLS] [SEP] the
receiving party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information
that the receiving party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or
known to it prior to receipt of the confidential information; (ii) is or has
become public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (iii) is
rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach
of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by
employees of the receiving party who had no access to such information. [CLS] [SEP] the
receiving party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court
order, provided the receiving party notifies the disclosing party in advance
and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. [CLS] [SEP] the receiving
party acknowledges that disclosure of confidential information would cause
substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and
therefore that upon any such disclosure by the receiving party the disclosing
party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to
whatever other remedies it might have at law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 16. [CLS] [SEP] co-marketing

at the request of intercom, customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press
release (" **press release** ") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day
from the effective date, whichever is earlier. [CLS] [SEP] each party will have the right
to approve the press release in advance, but such approval will not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld. [CLS] [SEP] customer also agrees to participate in other
reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the services to
other potential customers and to use of customer's name and logo on intercom's
web site and in intercom promotional materials. [CLS] [SEP] customer agrees that intercom
may disclose customer as a customer of intercom. [CLS] [SEP]

## 17. [CLS] [SEP] general terms

17.1. [CLS] [SEP] **assignment** . [CLS] [SEP] this agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of
each party's permitted successors and assigns. [CLS] [SEP] neither party may assign this
agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that
either party may assign this agreement in connection with a merger,
reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of
such party's assets or voting securities. [CLS] [SEP] any attempt to transfer or assign
this agreement except as expressly authorized under this section 17.1 will be
null and void. [CLS] [SEP]

17.2. [CLS] [SEP] **severability**. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this agreement will be adjudged by
any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that
provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this
agreement will otherwise remain in effect. [CLS] [SEP]

17.3. [CLS] [SEP] **governing law; dispute resolution**. [CLS] [SEP]

a) direct dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any dispute, claim, question, or
disagreement arising from or relating to this agreement, whether arising in
contract, tort or otherwise, (" **dispute** "), the parties shall first use
their best efforts to resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] if a dispute arises, the
complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a
document specifically entitled "initial notice of dispute," specifically
setting forth the precise nature of the dispute (" **initial notice of
dispute** "). [CLS] [SEP] if an initial notice of dispute is being sent to intercom it
must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to:

attn: legal department intercom 55 second street, suite 400 san francisco, ca
94105

following receipt of the initial notice of dispute, the parties shall consult
and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual
interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the dispute that
is satisfactory to both parties (" **direct dispute resolution** "). [CLS] [SEP] if the
parties are unable to reach a resolution of the dispute through direct dispute
resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the initial notice of
dispute, then the dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set
forth below. [CLS] [SEP]

b) arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that a dispute between the parties cannot be
settled through direct dispute resolution, as described above, the parties
agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] by agreeing to arbitrate,
the parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall
be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, before jams in san francisco,
california. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be administered by jams in accordance with
this document and the jams streamlined rules and procedures for the
arbitration, with one addition: the limitation of one discovery deposition per
side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all
relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual
issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether
any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have
sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested
discovery. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration will occur in san francisco, california, but the parties may
choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the
submission of documents. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing. [CLS] [SEP] any issue concerning the extent
to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability,
interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the
arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply
the substantive law of california. [CLS] [SEP]

all aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither
the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the
arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory
requirements. [CLS] [SEP] the result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties
and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the
costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in
connection with the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

c) choice of law and jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] for any claim which is not subject to this
dispute resolution provision, customer agrees to submit and consent to the
personal and exclusive jurisdiction in, and the exclusive venue of, the state
and federal courts located within san francisco county, california. [CLS] [SEP] in any
dispute, california law shall apply. [CLS] [SEP]

d) construction and joinder. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement must be construed as if it was
jointly written by both parties. [CLS] [SEP] both customer and intercom agree that each
may bring or participate in claims against the other only in their respective
individual capacities, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class. [CLS] [SEP] no arbitration or claim under this agreement shall be joined to any
other arbitration or claim, including any arbitration or claim involving any
other current or former user of the services, and no class arbitration
proceedings shall be permitted. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any dispute concerning the
validity or enforceability of this provision, such claim must be adjudicated
by a court and not by an arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

e) injunctive relief. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the above provisions, intercom may apply
for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

17.4. [CLS] [SEP] **notice**. [CLS] [SEP] any notice or communication required or permitted under this
agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the
order form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party
to the other in accordance with this section and will be deemed to have been
received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt; (ii)
if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following
dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid
and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is
deposited in the mail. [CLS] [SEP]

17.5. [CLS] [SEP] **amendments; waivers**. [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise provided herein, no
supplement, modification, or amendment of this agreement will be binding,
unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party
to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] no waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to
enforce or exercise rights under this agreement, nor will any waiver be
effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on
behalf of the party claimed to have waived. [CLS] [SEP] no provision of any purchase order
or other business form employed by customer will supersede the terms and
conditions of this agreement, and any such document relating to this agreement
will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect. [CLS] [SEP]

17.6. [CLS] [SEP] **entire agreement**. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement is the complete and exclusive
statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and
cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating
to the subject matter of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] customer acknowledges that the
services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to
provide improved customer experience intercom may make changes to the
services, and intercom will update the applicable documentation accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]
the support and service level availability terms described in the support
policy and the sla may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to
customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the
modifications will not materially decrease intercom's obligations as compared
to those reflected in such terms as of the effective date). [CLS] [SEP]

17.7. [CLS] [SEP] **force majeure**. [CLS] [SEP] neither party will be liable to the other for any
delay or failure to perform any obligation under this agreement (except for a
failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that
occur after the signing of this agreement and that are beyond the reasonable
control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism,
riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications
or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. [CLS] [SEP]

17.8. [CLS] [SEP] **subcontractors** . [CLS] [SEP] intercom may use the services of subcontractors and
permit them to exercise the rights granted to intercom in order to provide the
services under this agreement, provided that intercom remains responsible for
(i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this agreement and
(ii) for the overall performance of the services as required under this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

17.9. [CLS] [SEP] **subpoenas**. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this agreement prevents intercom from
disclosing customer data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court
orders, but intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify
customer where permitted to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

17.10. [CLS] [SEP] **independent contractors**. [CLS] [SEP] the parties to this agreement are
independent contractors. [CLS] [SEP] there is no relationship of partnership, joint
venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. [CLS] [SEP]
neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on
the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent

17.11. [CLS] [SEP] **export control**. [CLS] [SEP] in its use of the services, customer agrees to
comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the united states
and other applicable jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, (i)
customer represents and warrants that it is not listed on any u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government
list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a
country that is subject to a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government embargo or that has been
designated by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government as a "terrorist supporting" country, (ii)
customer will not (and will not permit any of its users to) access or use the
services in violation of any u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export embargo, prohibition or restriction,
and (iii) customer will not submit to the services any information that is
controlled under the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] international traffic in arms regulations

17.12. [CLS] [SEP] **government end-users**. [CLS] [SEP] elements of the services are commercial
computer software. [CLS] [SEP] if the user or licensee of the services is an agency,
department, or other entity of the united states government, the use,
duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of
the services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical
data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this
agreement in accordance with federal acquisition regulation 12.212 for
civilian purposes and defense federal acquisition regulation supplement
227.7202 for military purposes. [CLS] [SEP] all services were developed fully at private
expense. [CLS] [SEP] all other use is prohibited

17.13. [CLS] [SEP] **counterparts.** this agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will be
