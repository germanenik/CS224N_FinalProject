how we collect information from you

information that you give to us

in the course of providing you access to the network, as well as products and
services, stack overflow collects and receives personal information in a few
ways, for example, when you set up a stack overflow account or register for a
product, newsletter or service., e.g. [CLS] [SEP] a demo or make comments on our site. [CLS] [SEP]
often, you can choose what information to provide, but sometimes we require
personal information from you to carry out certain activities such as account
verification or registration. [CLS] [SEP] this section details the ways in which we
collect information from you and how that information is received. [CLS] [SEP]

information we generate or collect automatically through your use of our
services

we use cookies, which are small text files that collect and track certain
technical information, and similar technologies to help us operate and provide
our services to you. [CLS] [SEP] this information includes:

  * information about the systems and device(s) you use to access our services, including, ip address, browser type and version, time zone setting, operating system and platform, device type, and device identifiers; 
  * information about your visits to the websites, including the full url clickstream to, through and from the websites (including date and time); 
  * information about your use of our mobile apps, including the information you view in our mobile apps and the date and time you view it; 
  * information to facilitate your use of our services (including to provide access to third-party websites and services), such as url requests, destination ip addresses, or device configuration details; and 
  * pages you view or search for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), your engagement with certain variable/dynamic elements of a page and methods used to browse away from the page. [CLS] [SEP] 

more information on cookies can be found [here](/legal/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

information we collect about you from third parties

our products and services may also, from time to time, contain links to and
from social media platforms. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to connect with us through a social
media platform, we may, through the social media platform connection, collect
additional information from you, such as your user names, profile picture,
contact information, contact list, and the profile pictures of your contacts. [CLS] [SEP]
similarly, the social media platforms may collect information about your
interaction with our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have any control of the
collection, use and sharing of your information when using any social media
platforms. [CLS] [SEP] you should read any associated privacy policies before using them. [CLS] [SEP]

information we collect from other sources, e.g.: information from third party
providers, information that helps us to combat fraud or that relates to your
social interactions (including your communications via social media, between
individuals, organisations, prospects and other stakeholders acquired from
companies that collect combined information);

we may combine the information we collect about you from the various sources
described above. [CLS] [SEP]

why we collect your information (purposes)

this section explains why we collect your information and what we need it for
(purposes). [CLS] [SEP] this is set out below, by reference to what the information is
required for. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect and process your personal information in order to offer the
network, and to offer you our products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you decline to provide us with personal information when we ask you, you
may not be able to access all or some of our services and you may not be able
to use the network or certain products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you do
not provide us with your email address or other information required for
account registration, we will not be able to register you for certain account
services. [CLS] [SEP]

account registration information

we need to collect your personal information for account registration
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] although the network provides for anonymous and pseudonymous
participation, in some instances in order to use certain products or services,
we require account registration. [CLS] [SEP] this requires a name associated with your
account, an email address at which we can contact you, and in some cases,
additional information including, a contact address, a billing address, and a
password to help secure your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

profile information

when completing a public “profile”, whether it is for use with the network or
our products and services, we may require you to share certain personally
identifying information in required and optional profile fields. [CLS] [SEP] the name
associated with your account, which you may review and change in your account
settings, as well as reputation points are publicly displayed and connected to
your activity on the stack overflow network and via certain products and
services such as our talent and teams platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

other profile information may also be publicly displayed if you choose to
complete certain elective components of the account registration options
including, e.g., your developer story, display picture, affiliated role and
company, your location and your preferred technologies (javascript, swift,
sql-server, etc.), and some information is publicly displayed and required,
such as how long you have been a member. [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, you may elect to share additional information that is not required
but this will be displayed publicly at your election. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are using the private network (e.g., stack overflow for teams), your
account settings including, name, affiliated role and company, and other
information may be shared with your private network team members designated as
authorized users of your private network account. [CLS] [SEP] while some of the public and
private network profile information is required, much of it is within your
control as we describe herein and can be modified, updated, and restricted by
you in your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP]

information we use to identify and authenticate you. [CLS] [SEP] we need this information
to be able to recognize you, for example, when you access your accounts. [CLS] [SEP] it
also helps us to protect your details and keep them secure. [CLS] [SEP]

marketing and sales information, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] details of the services you receive and
your preferences; information about your device or the software you use, e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
its ip address, technical specification and uniquely identifying data; cookies
and similar technologies we use to recognize you, remember your preferences
and tailor the content we provide to you – our [cookie policy](/legal/cookie-
policy) contains more details about how we use cookies . [CLS] [SEP]

device and browser information received automatically

when you visit the network or use our apps, stack overflow automatically
receives and records information from your browser or mobile device, such as
your internet protocol (ip) address or unique device identifier. [CLS] [SEP] cookies and
data about which pages you visit on our network allow us to operate and
optimize the products and services we provide to you. [CLS] [SEP] this information is
stored in secure logs and is collected automatically. [CLS] [SEP]

we may combine this browser information with other information we collect
about you. [CLS] [SEP] this information is used to keep the products and services secure,
to analyze and understand how our products and services are used, optimize
such usage, provide advertising across the network as well as certain products
and services to personalize your experience, and to help connect you with
potential job opportunities in the case of our recruiting products and
services. [CLS] [SEP]

location information

when you use the stack overflow network, and certain of our products and
services, we collect location information about you including your ip address,
your location, browser information, and how you came to the stack overflow
network. [CLS] [SEP] this is the case for individuals who have registered for an account,
and non-members who engage with the stack overflow network by visiting our
website(s) but who have not completed an account registration. [CLS] [SEP]

this information is collected for various purposes, including advertising,
analytics and to serve content as it relates to certain products or services
(e.g., talent), as well as to provide you with localized content,
recommendations, and marketing. [CLS] [SEP] you may revoke our permission to collect some
of this data, including your location and browser information through your
account settings, but this may limit functionality in some cases. [CLS] [SEP] certain
location information we collect is required for security and site
functionality. [CLS] [SEP] we share this information with certain third-parties (e.g.,
talent recruiters, payment processors, and advertising providers) in order to
provide you with our products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

who we share your information with

we may share personal information with third parties who provide services to
stack overflow, such as payment processors, email delivery services, software
providers, advertising providers and when we enter into product integrations
with software providers. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, to improve user experience, we offer
single sign-on solutions for account login and these third parties (including
facebook and google) may receive information from these services when you
elect to use them. [CLS] [SEP] when stack overflow shares your personal information and
other collected information with third party service providers, we require
that they use your information only for the purpose of providing services to
us and consistent with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

advertising and marketing partners

when you register for an account, and when you interact with stack overflow,
e.g., when you use the public network, we and authorized third parties place
cookies on you and your account activity as described in more detail within
our [cookie policy](/legal/cookie-policy). [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to serve
you certain advertising content. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, we market our products and
services to you and communicate important information, product and other
opportunities to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to receive direct marketing
communications from us, you can tell us and remove yourself from our marketing
communications via the unsubscribe and opt out options in our email
communications and your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on how to
control your account settings or to opt out of direct marketing campaigns,
please visit your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP]

analytics information

stack overflow uses data analytics to ensure site functionality and to
optimize our product and service offerings to you. [CLS] [SEP] we use web browser and
mobile analytics to allow us to understand network and apps functionality. [CLS] [SEP] in
doing so, we record information including, for example how often you visit the
network, how often you contribute content, network and apps performance data,
errors and debugging information, and the type of activity you engage in while
on the network or in your use of our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we may on occasion
share this information with third parties for research or product and services
optimization. [CLS] [SEP]

billing information

for products and services requiring payment, we collect a billing name, phone
number, and email address. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect a billing and shipping address for
invoicing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] if you elect to pay by credit card, stack overflow may
engage a third party to securely process your payment. [CLS] [SEP] all payment processing
is done through a pci dss compliant third party. [CLS] [SEP] if customers are paying by a
credit card, their card details are vaulted through a third-party payment
gateway. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow will store an encrypted token along with the last four
digits of the credit card and the expiration month and year of the card and
will not store or retain any other billing information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

developer survey

as the world’s largest developer community, stack overflow publishes an annual
developer survey to provide key insights into the developer community, as well
as other surveys from time to time, all of which include demographic (e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
gender, race, age etc) and certain personal information. [CLS] [SEP] your participation in
the developer survey as well as any other stack overflow survey is entirely
voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] in order to provide meaningful insights into the developer
community, stack overflow may collect sensitive data about you, including, but
not limited to your gender, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and
your location. [CLS] [SEP] we consider this data to be among our most sensitive, and have
taken elevated measures to protect such data as well as to de-identify your
name and other personal information from such data. [CLS] [SEP] we restrict such data
within stack overflow on a privileged basis to only those that need to see it
and while we may share your personal information with certain third parties
such as researchers, we do so only after imposing contractual obligations of
confidentiality on such third parties and only where absolutely necessary for
limited research purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

when we publish our surveys, they are published as a compilation of anonymized
data, which means that we take every effort to ensure that your information is
understood in a statistical narrative decoupled from your personal identity. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have any questions concerning the developer survey or other survey and
our security measures to protect your sensitive personal data, please contact
us at: privacy@stackoverflow.com. [CLS] [SEP]

legal basis for processing your information

we will only use your information where we have a legal basis for using it,
for example, where we have your consent, or where we need to carry out
processing to provide you with a service you have requested. [CLS] [SEP] this section
describes the legal bases we rely on for processing your information,
including when we share it with third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

when you access the stack overflow network and use the products and services
we offer, we collect, display, store, share, transmit, and process your
information in the manner described in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to carry out these activities, stack overflow may rely on the
following legal bases in order to process your personal data:

  * where you have given us consent to process the information, which you can withdraw at any time. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * where the processing is necessary: 
    * to carry out the contractual obligations in the terms of service or to provide the products and services you have requested 
    * to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims 
    * to protect the public interest or vital interest of others 
  * where it is in our legitimate interests, or that of a third party to carry out the processing. [CLS] [SEP] 

whenever we rely on legitimate interests for processing, we ensure that we
consider and balance our interests against the individual’s interests before
processing. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use your personal data on the basis of legitimate
interest for activities where individuals’ interests override our interests. [CLS] [SEP]

where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do
so in order to:

secure your personal data and information

stack overflow is committed to the safety and security of your personal data
and the information that you share with us and with the public. [CLS] [SEP] we treat your
personal data and safety from harassment as top organizational priorities. [CLS] [SEP] at
stack overflow we consider it necessary to pursue these legitimate interests
in order to keep our community, you and your information safe from spam,
harassment, intellectual property infringement, identity theft, and the
scraping and unlawful collection of your information. [CLS] [SEP]

provide and optimize products and services

we use your information to provide and improve our products and services, for
identification, verification, to provide support, for online and offline
marketing including through third party tools such as google analytics, and
for general research and analytics reporting. [CLS] [SEP] in doing so, we may learn which
of our products and services you are using most, what you’re interested in,
and to better enable you to use and access our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] as a
core part of our business, stack overflow has a legitimate interest in
enabling and customizing your experience of our product and services
offerings. [CLS] [SEP]

engage in commercial transactions

as part of providing our core products and services, stack overflow may charge
you for the use of some products and services, or certain features within
these products and services. [CLS] [SEP] in order to process your payment, and to secure
your financial information, we may facilitate the sharing of your information
with third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we share your information only with third parties who have
met strict security standards and consider the secure processing of your
financial information to be a strict and legitimate business necessity. [CLS] [SEP]

comply with regulatory and legal obligations

stack overflow has a legitimate interest in complying with certain legal
obligations and interests which, from time to time, may require the disclosure
of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow will not disclose your personal
information to legal authorities except where such disclosure is by lawful
request, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement
demands (including a subpoena, court order, or other lawful legal demand by a
legal authority with lawful jurisdiction). [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may also release
your personal information to defend our legitimate legal interests. [CLS] [SEP] we
consider our obligation to protect the stack overflow community from imminent
physical harm to be both a legitimate business interest as well as to be
within the public interest and may disclose your personal information if we
believe you or another individual may be in imminent danger of harm to
yourself or to another. [CLS] [SEP]

marketing and product communications

from time to time, stack overflow may communicate with you about commercial
and other product and services offerings. [CLS] [SEP] in doing so, we provide you with an
opportunity to opt-out of such messages at any time you choose via your
account settings. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow will not sell your personal information to
enhance our marketing opportunities or profitability (except as may relate to
a corporate event such as a sale or merger), and as we are committed to
preventing spam, our direct marketing efforts are limited in scope and
frequency. [CLS] [SEP] we engage in such activities as a legitimate business interest in
order to promote key products and service offerings and provide you with every
opportunity to unsubscribe from such communications or to further limit their
scope and frequency. [CLS] [SEP] in short, while we want to communicate some key
commercial communications with you and have determined it to be a legitimate
interest for us to be able to do so, you have the final say in whether or not
you would like to receive such commercial communications from us. [CLS] [SEP] you can
review or change your permissions in your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP]

core business operations

stack overflow may engage with third parties in business transactions
including the buying and selling of assets, the auditing of our business
practices and financials, and to engage in business development opportunities. [CLS] [SEP]
these core activities may involve the processing and/or disclosure of some
limited personal information which may be necessary and within our legitimate
interests to develop the stack overflow brand and business. [CLS] [SEP] if we transfer any
personal information in pursuing such a business transaction, we will always
ensure that strict confidentiality measures are in place to protect your
privacy interests. [CLS] [SEP]

your choice and control of the information we collect on you

privacy is a guiding principle of all stack overflow products and services and
we value your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] to this end, we provide you with the ability to control
how your information is stored, and what information is collected. [CLS] [SEP] you may
change or correct your account settings and choose not to share certain
information by creating a pseudonymous account. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, much of the data
we collect is voluntary and your choice entirely to provide us or not. [CLS] [SEP] you may
also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be
publicly displayed, such as your photo, or job history. [CLS] [SEP] in the event stack
overflow decides to provide additional opt-out or opt-in mechanisms under the
privacy shield framework, the mechanisms will be clear, conspicuous, and
readily available for you to exercise your choice. [CLS] [SEP] and of course, should you
wish, you may also request the permanent deletion of your account, in which
case all personal information collected on you will be removed from our
servers and encrypted (except, in some cases your ip address required for
security purposes, site maintenance, and spam protection). [CLS] [SEP]

we also provide you additional data control options created by the gdpr, but
provided to the stack overflow community regardless of geographic location
with respect to your information, including data access and portability
(including the right to obtain and download a copy of the personal data you
provided to stack overflow), data correction (the ability to update the
personal data we collect and display on you, in many cases via your account
settings), data deletion (where stack overflow will delete personal
information stored on you, which we are not required by necessity to
maintain), and the ability to have us stop processing your personal data (with
certain exceptions as may be necessary). [CLS] [SEP] you may submit data requests to
privacy@stackoverflow.com. [CLS] [SEP]

please also be aware that in order to respond to data requests and provide
data choices to you, we may need to first verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP]

you may additionally control the receipt of certain marketing and advertising
communications from stack overflow. [CLS] [SEP] some messages that we send are required,
and related to our legal obligations, or service related and mandatory. [CLS] [SEP] other
messages, like marketing and advertising communications are provided by us to
let you know how you can continue to share, learn, and build your knowledge
within the stack overflow community, and are voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] we provide you with
the opportunity to control which voluntary (non-mandatory/required) messages
you would like to receive in your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP]

additional information we collect on you when you use specific products

when you register for our services or if you or your organization set up a
private network, we may collect some additional information in connection with
that service or product. [CLS] [SEP] this section describes in further detail the
information we collect on you and how we use that information broken down by
our products and services offerings. [CLS] [SEP]

online and other digital advertising

when you access our websites, we may use your information to provide you with
advertising content. [CLS] [SEP]

we will only process your data for any online or digital advertising on the

stack overflow will process your information through, or on behalf of its
entities located in canada, the united states, the united kingdom, the eea. [CLS] [SEP] we
may transfer your information to companies working on our behalf and to other
third parties and agents located outside the european economic area. [CLS] [SEP]

please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries
outside the eea, including the rights of authorities to access your personal

international data transfers

stack overflow is a global community and as such, you may access the stack
overflow network from almost anywhere in the world. [CLS] [SEP] when you do this, you will
also be subject to the local laws of your jurisdiction you are accessing it
from. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing the stack overflow network and engaging with our products
and services, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected and
transferred from your local jurisdiction (including member states to the
european union) to the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

where stack overflow transfers your personal data from your local jurisdiction
(including member states to the european union) we rely on certain lawful
transfer mechanisms to do so, including the following lawful bases for such
transfers:

privacy shield

stack overflow complies with the eu - us privacy shield framework and swiss -
us privacy shield framework as set forth by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information
transferred from the european union and switzerland to the united states. [CLS] [SEP]
stack overflow has certified (note: certification under legal name stack
exchange, inc.) to the department of commerce that it adheres to the privacy
shield principles including onward transfer principles as amended by the gdpr
where applicable. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow acknowledges accountability under the onward
transfer principles of the privacy shield framework when transferring data to
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy
policy and the privacy shield principles, the privacy shield principles shall
govern. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about the privacy shield program, and to view our
certification, please visit
[https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov). [CLS] [SEP] stack
exchange, inc. [CLS] [SEP] is subject to the investigative and enforcement powers of the
federal trade commission. [CLS] [SEP] under certain circumstances, you may invoke binding
arbitration to determine, for residual claims, whether stack overflow has
violated its privacy shield obligations, and whether any such violation
remains fully or partially unremedied. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow has further committed to
refer unresolved privacy shield complaints to the privacytrust shield program,
an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the united kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] if
you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint from stack
overflow, or if we have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction,
please contact us: privacy@stackoverflow.com or visit
<https://privacytrust.com/drs/stackexchange> or at the contact information
provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

standard contractual clauses

the european commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also
referred to as model clauses), which provide safeguards to protect the
transfer of personal information outside of the european union. [CLS] [SEP] we may use
these standard contractual clauses when transferring personal information
outside of the european union. [CLS] [SEP] you may review and request a copy of such
standard contractual clauses as used by stack overflow by contacting us at
legal@stackoverflow.com. [CLS] [SEP]

our ongoing commitment to data security

security is important to us and we know it is important to you. [CLS] [SEP] stack overflow
follows generally accepted standards to protect your personal information when
processing, transferring, and storing your personal information including
transport layer security (“tls”), by restricting your personal data when we do
not need to access it and by keeping your personal data only as necessary to
perform our legitimate business interests. [CLS] [SEP]

as the data subject, you too have an important role to play in helping us
protect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to protect yourself
against unauthorized access to your personal information by choosing a
password carefully and in accordance with industry best standards. [CLS] [SEP] do not
share your password with anyone you do not trust, and make sure your computer
accesses stack overflow via a secure network and that you do not leave your
personal information vulnerable to hackers and other bad actors by leaving
your computer unattended or by failing to logout of your account when you have
ended your session activity. [CLS] [SEP]

direct marketing opt out

you may opt-out of receiving stack overflow email marketing materials by using
the unsubscribe link in these communications or by changing your email
settings. [CLS] [SEP]

additional information for california consumers

under the california consumer privacy act (“ccpa”), we are required to notify
california consumers about our collection, use, and disclosure of their
personal information (whether collected through this website or offline). [CLS] [SEP]
please see more information about this in the legal section of our website. [CLS] [SEP]

privacy policy amendments

we may amend or update this policy from time to time and will notify you of
any material changes to this policy. [CLS] [SEP] previous versions of this privacy policy
are available upon request. [CLS] [SEP]
