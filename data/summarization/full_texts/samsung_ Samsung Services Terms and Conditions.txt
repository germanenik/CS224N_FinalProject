(“services”), and these terms and conditions (“terms”) will cover your use of
our services. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you also confirm that:

changes by posting the updated terms on our
[website](https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms). [CLS] [SEP] if we think the

these terms of service constitute a binding legal agreement between you and
samsung, including the terms and conditions regarding dispute resolution, set
forth on the governing law/dispute resolution section, below. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**governing law/ dispute resolution** | the formation, existence,
construction, performance, validity and all aspects whatsoever of these terms
will be governed by the law of the state of new york, without reference to its
choice of laws principles. [CLS] [SEP] these terms will not be governed by the un
convention on contracts for the international sale of goods, the application
of which is expressly excluded. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, we may apply
for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
all disputes with samsung arising in any way from these terms shall be
resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, and not by a court
or jury. [CLS] [SEP] any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute
involving service provided to any other person or entity, and specifically,
without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed
as part of a class action. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be conducted before a single
arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or amount, the relief allowed
by the applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be conducted according to the
american arbitration association (aaa) commercial arbitration rules applicable
to consumer disputes, and is entered pursuant to the federal arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP]
the arbitrator shall decide all issues of interpretation and application of
this arbitration provision and these terms. [CLS] [SEP] judgement may be entered on the
arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
this arbitration provision also applies to claims against our employees,
representatives and affiliates if any such claim arises from these terms. [CLS] [SEP] for
any arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees
and expert witness fees, are $5,000.00 or less (“small claim”), the arbitrator
may, if you prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees
and costs as part of any award, but may not grant us our attorney fees, expert
witness fees or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in
bad faith. [CLS] [SEP] in a small claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than
half of the total administrative, facility and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of
such fees, whichever is less, and we shall pay the remainder of such fees. [CLS] [SEP]
administrative, facility and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your
total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees,
exceed $5,000.00 (“large claim”) shall be determined according to aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]
in a large claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or
apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and
costs to the extent allowed by the applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] judgement may be entered on
the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]  
you may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to us
no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this service
authorization. [CLS] [SEP] to opt out, you must send notice by email to
optout@sea.samsung.com, with the subject line: “arbitration opt out.” you must
include in the opt out e mail (a) your name and address; (b) the date of this
service authorization; (c) the model name or model number of your device on
which the applicable service is used; and (d) the imei or meid or serial
numbers, as applicable, if you have it (the imei or meid or serial numbers can

can be found under “settings;” (iii) on a label on the back of the product
beneath the battery, if the battery is removable; and (iv) on the outside of
the product if the battery is not removable). [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, you may opt out
by calling 1 800 samsung (726-7864) no later than 30 calendar days from the
