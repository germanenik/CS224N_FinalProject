(for example, company-created content that appears on fandom.com)

photographs, music, graphics, and logos. [CLS] [SEP] such content may be accessible via a
player embedded on the services, which links to and plays content hosted on
other sites or services (“ **media player** ”). [CLS] [SEP]

deemed to create a license to the company original content, and you agree not
to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit,
publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative
works from the company original content. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the terms and conditions
of this agreement, company provides you with a license to use the company
original content for your personal, noncommercial use only. [CLS] [SEP] company may
terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. [CLS] [SEP] use of company
original content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this agreement is
strictly prohibited. [CLS] [SEP]

submit an application to provide original content, which company may approve
or deny in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if such original content is accepted by
company, it shall be subject to the rules for company original content that
are set forth above and that a contributor may agree to as part of the
application process. [CLS] [SEP]

the company may also provide links to articles on third party websites, as set
forth below under disclaimers and limitation of liability. [CLS] [SEP] because the company
has no control over such third party websites, the company is not responsible
for the availability of such websites and is not responsible for any content
on such websites. [CLS] [SEP]

publicly display such submitted content (including comments and quizzes) in
any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to
authorize others to do so (this license right includes the name, identity,
likeness and voice you submit with such content). [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you have the

other party. [CLS] [SEP]
