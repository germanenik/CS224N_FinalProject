## keybase terms of service

effective: january 9, 2020 (updated december 9, 2019)

**please note that keybase doesn’t provide warranties for the services. [CLS] [SEP] this
contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration
provision and a class action waiver.**

### welcome to keybase

we offer a range of products and services, including this website, mobile and
desktop apps for messaging and file sharing, encrypted git and a
cryptocurrency wallet (these terms and our privacy policy will refer to these
and all the other services and products we offer as our services). [CLS] [SEP] these terms
cover your use of our services, so please read them carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

### our business model and approach to privacy

our mission is to help you protect your privacy and your data. [CLS] [SEP] eventually, we
plan to offer a paid service for corporate teams, but for now keybase is free
for everyone. [CLS] [SEP] you can read more about our business model and our approach to
privacy [here](privacypolicy). [CLS] [SEP]

### note: when you publicly announce some of your account information, you
can’t delete or alter it

we use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers. [CLS] [SEP]
because of that, you can’t delete your publicly announced account information
and account activity once you post it. [CLS] [SEP]

### your content

our services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive both
encrypted and unencrypted content. [CLS] [SEP] you retain ownership of your rights in that
content. [CLS] [SEP] in other words, if it’s yours, it stays yours. [CLS] [SEP]

we only have limited rights to use your content so that we can provide and
improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] in legal terms (sorry, but we have to say it this way):
you give us rights to your content to the extent necessary to operate,
promote, and improve our services, and to develop new ones. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t have (and
can’t) access your encrypted content and these rights you’re granting us
doesn’t change that fact. [CLS] [SEP]

### content from our users

much of the content available in the services isn’t from keybase. [CLS] [SEP] this content
is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that makes it available. [CLS] [SEP] to
the extent content is unencrypted, we may review content to determine whether
it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display
content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. [CLS] [SEP] but that
does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that
we do. [CLS] [SEP]

### minimum age

our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if
you are under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] you must also be old enough to consent to the
processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may
allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf). [CLS] [SEP]

### your promise to us when you use our services

you agree that you will not misuse the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, don’t interfere
with our services or try to access them using methods we don’t provide to you. [CLS] [SEP]
you may use our services only as permitted by law, including applicable export
and re-export control laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP] we may suspend or stop providing
our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies, including
our [acceptable use policy](acceptable-use-policy), or if we are investigating
suspected misconduct. [CLS] [SEP]

### our intellectual property rights

you agree that your intellectual property rights in our services are limited
to your limited right to use our services in accordance with these terms and
the licenses listed in our [github repositories](https://github.com/keybase). [CLS] [SEP]
using our services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
rights in our services or the content you access. [CLS] [SEP] open source software is
important to us. [CLS] [SEP] some software used in our services may be offered under an
open source license that we will make available to you. [CLS] [SEP] there may be
provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] the services contains the open source packages listed
[here](https://github.com/keybase/client/search?q=filename%3alicense&type=code). [CLS] [SEP]

### your keybase account

to protect your keybase account, keep your password confidential, install
keybase on more than one device, and write down your paper key and keep it
somewhere safe. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for the activity that happens on or
through your keybase account. [CLS] [SEP] don’t reuse your keybase account password
anywhere else. [CLS] [SEP]

we strongly encourage you to install the keybase app on more than one device
and to keep a hard copy of your paper key. [CLS] [SEP] if all of your devices provisioned
with keybase are lost or damaged and you do not have a hard copy of your paper
key, your keybase account and all of your content associated with the services
will be lost forever. [CLS] [SEP] all of keybase is end-to-end encrypted (other than files
that you store in your public folder and chat messages in public chats), which
means that keybase is unable to access any of your messages or content. [CLS] [SEP] you
are responsible for keeping your keybase account and your devices secure. [CLS] [SEP]

in connection with your use of the services, we may send you service
announcements, administrative messages, and other information. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out
of some of those communications. [CLS] [SEP]

### copyright protection

we respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts
of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] digital
millennium copyright act. [CLS] [SEP]

we provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
property online. [CLS] [SEP] if you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want
to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and keybase’s
[policy about responding to notices](copyright-violations). [CLS] [SEP]

### modifying and terminating our services

we are constantly changing and improving our services. [CLS] [SEP] we may add or remove
functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a service altogether. [CLS] [SEP]
some of our software may update automatically on your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

you can stop using our services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see
you go. [CLS] [SEP] keybase may also stop providing services to you, or add or create new
limits to our services at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

we believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is
important. [CLS] [SEP] if we discontinue a service, where reasonably possible, we will
give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that
service. [CLS] [SEP]

### updates to these terms

we may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a service to,
for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our services. [CLS] [SEP] changes
will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen
days after they are posted. [CLS] [SEP] however, changes addressing new functions for a
service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. [CLS] [SEP] if
you do not agree to the modified terms for a service, you should discontinue
your use of that service. [CLS] [SEP]

you should look at the terms regularly. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll post notice of modifications to
these terms on this page. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll post notice of modified additional terms in
the applicable service. [CLS] [SEP]

### business uses of our services

if you are using our services on behalf of a business, that business accepts
these terms. [CLS] [SEP] it will hold harmless and indemnify keybase and its affiliates,
officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or
related to the use of the services or violation of these terms, including any
liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments,
litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. [CLS] [SEP]

### joining a keybase team

when you join a team, the team administrators are able to read and delete any
information you post into any chat channels in the team. [CLS] [SEP] they can read, edit
and delete any information you put into the team kbfs folder (this is also
true for any other members in the team, except "reader"s). [CLS] [SEP] they can also
change your role in the team and subscribe you to chat channels within that
team. [CLS] [SEP]

### no warranty

keybase provides the service “as is”, “with all faults” and “as available”. [CLS] [SEP] to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, keybase, along with its
service providers and representatives, make no (and specifically disclaims
all) representations or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, including, without limitation, any warranty that the
service will be uninterrupted, error-free or free of harmful components, that
your content will be secure or not otherwise lost or damaged, or any implied
warranty of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement, and any warranty arising out of any course of
performance, course of dealing or usage of trade. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not
allow the foregoing exclusions. [CLS] [SEP] in such an event such exclusion will not apply
solely to the extent prohibited by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

### limitation of liability

to the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will keybase, its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for:
any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential
damages, or damages for lost profits, revenue, goodwill, use or content,
however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation,
contract, tort, warranty, negligence or otherwise, even if keybase has been
advised as to the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law, the aggregate liability of keybase and its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors, relating to the services
will be limited to fifty dollars ($50.00). [CLS] [SEP] the limitations and exclusions also
apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of
its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of
incidental, consequential or other damages. [CLS] [SEP] in such an event this limitation
will not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge that the foregoing limitations are an essential element of the
agreement between you and keybase and that in the absence of such limitations
the terms and conditions set forth in these terms would be substantially
different. [CLS] [SEP]

### arbitration

these arbitration and class action waiver sections includes an arbitration
agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an
individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative
proceeding). [CLS] [SEP] please read them carefully. [CLS] [SEP] you may opt out of the arbitration
agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that in the event of any dispute between you and keybase, you will
first contact keybase and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the
dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without
limitation any court action. [CLS] [SEP]

#### arbitration agreement

after the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute,
controversy, or claim (collectively, “claim”) relating in any way to your use
of keybase’s services and/or products, including the service, or relating in
any way to the communications between you and keybase or any other user of the
service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] this mandatory
arbitration agreement applies equally to you and keybase. [CLS] [SEP] however, this
arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any claim by keybase for
infringement of its intellectual property or access to the service that is
unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these terms or (b) bar you
from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate
cases. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement
within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this service by
following the procedure described below. [CLS] [SEP]

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] there is no judge or
jury in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]
court review of an arbitration award is limited. [CLS] [SEP] except to the extent the
parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
that a court can award. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal arbitration act
governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and
keybase are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
class action. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration provision will survive any termination of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal
dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration
and describing your claim to keybase, inc., attn: president, 85 broad st.,
28th floor - ny, ny 10004. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be administered by the
american arbitration association (aaa) under its rules including, if you are
an individual, the aaa's supplementary procedures for consumer-related
disputes. [CLS] [SEP] if you are not an individual or have used the services on behalf of
an entity, the aaa's supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes
will not be used. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa's rules are available at
[www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP]

the number of arbitrators will be one. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to have the arbitration
conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the
county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration
will be conducted in the english language and new york law will apply. [CLS] [SEP]
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
the aaa's rules. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual and have not accessed or used the
service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims
totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration
unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have
exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation
of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of
this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. [CLS] [SEP] however, the preceding
sentence will not apply to the “class action waiver” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not want to arbitrate disputes with keybase and you are an
individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email
to [legal@keybase.io](mailto:legal@keybase.io) within thirty (30) days of the
first date you access or use the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### class action waiver

any claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and
not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective,
representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“class action”). [CLS] [SEP]
the parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any class action in any
forum. [CLS] [SEP] if the claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have
authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any class action
nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] any
claim that all or part of this class action waiver is unenforceable,
unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of
competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the parties understand that
any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or
to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any
claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
the arbitration agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief warranted by that party's individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a claim
proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and keybase each waive any
right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
federal courts located in new york, new york. [CLS] [SEP]

### miscellaneous legal terms

when we refer to “keybase” and “we” or “us” we mean keybase, inc., a delaware
corporation. [CLS] [SEP]

if we need to provide notice to you, we will do so via your keybase account or
the email address we have on file for you. [CLS] [SEP]

if a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these terms as written, you
and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable
under the relevant law, but the rest of these terms will remain in effect. [CLS] [SEP]
this is the entire contract between you and us regarding the service. [CLS] [SEP] it
supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use
of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not assign these terms or transfer any rights to use the service. [CLS] [SEP] we
may assign our rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any
successor in interest of any business associated with the services. [CLS] [SEP]

keybase and you are not legal partners or agents. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are solely for
your and our benefit. [CLS] [SEP] it is not for the benefit of any other person, except
for permitted successors. [CLS] [SEP]

you must bring any claim related to these terms or the service within one year
of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a
longer time to file claims. [CLS] [SEP] if it isn’t filed in time, the claim is
permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]

the terms are governed by the laws of the state of new york without regard to
conflict of laws rules. [CLS] [SEP]

the failure of you or keybase to insist upon or enforce strict performance of
any of the provisions of these terms or to exercise any rights or remedies
under these terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any
extent of your right or keybase’s right to assert or rely upon any such
provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same
will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
