# our privacy principles

at snap, we make your privacy a priority. [CLS] [SEP] we know your trust is earned every
time you use snapchat, or any of our other products — that’s why we treat your
information differently than most other tech companies. [CLS] [SEP]

we don’t stockpile your private messages and we don’t publicly showcase a
timeline of everything you’ve ever posted. [CLS] [SEP] snapchat’s designed so that people
can only see the things you want to share, for as long as you want to share
them. [CLS] [SEP] we believe this makes snapchat feel less like a permanent record and
more like a conversation with friends. [CLS] [SEP]

even though our products are constantly evolving, our privacy principles
remain unchanged:

# we communicate honestly and openly

when you use snap products, you share information with us — it’s our
responsibility to help you understand how that information is used. [CLS] [SEP] our
[privacy policy](/en-us/privacy/privacy-policy/) explains how we collect, use,
and share information — you can read the highlights [here](/en-
us/privacy/your-privacy/). [CLS] [SEP] if you’re curious about how a certain feature uses
your data, [privacy by product](/en-us/privacy/privacy-by-product/) breaks
things down a bit more. [CLS] [SEP] we also explain how features use data right inside of
our apps, and throughout our [support center](https://support.snapchat.com/). [CLS] [SEP]
of course, if you still can’t find what you need, [you can always ask](/en-
us/)!

arrow.svg)

# you choose how to express yourself

we believe that privacy is essential to empowering self-expression. [CLS] [SEP] that’s why
you’re in control of who you share things with, how you share them, and how
long they can be seen. [CLS] [SEP] you decide who can see your story, which friends can
see your bitmoji on the snap map, and just how long your snaps stick around. [CLS] [SEP]
you can keep things just between you and a friend, or share a moment with the
whole world! [learn more](https://support.snapchat.com/a/privacy-settings2). [CLS] [SEP]

scale.svg)

# we design with privacy in mind

new features go through an intense privacy review process — we talk about
things, we debate them, and we work hard to build products we’re proud of and
that we’ll want to use. [CLS] [SEP] after all, we use these products every day, both at
work and in our personal lives. [CLS] [SEP] we handle your information with the same care
that we use for ourselves, our company, our family, and our friends. [CLS] [SEP]

diary.svg)

# you control your information

you have the right to control your information. [CLS] [SEP] that’s why we provide easy
ways to access and update your information, adjust how much information you
share with us, and request that we delete your information — or your account,
altogether. [CLS] [SEP] you can control most of your privacy settings right in our mobile
applications. [CLS] [SEP] you can even log in and download your snapchat information
[here](https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/welcome). [CLS] [SEP] if you ever have any
specific questions about your data, don’t hesitate to [contact
us](https://support.snapchat.com/i-need-help)!

# deletion is our default

snapchat aims to capture the feeling of hanging out with friends in person —
that’s why snaps and chats are deleted from our servers once they’re opened or
expired. [CLS] [SEP] after a snap is deleted, we’ll mainly be able to see the basic
details — like when it was sent and who it was sent to. [CLS] [SEP] [learn
more](https://support.snapchat.com/article/when-are-snaps-chats-deleted). [CLS] [SEP]

it’s important to keep in mind that other snapchatters can always take a
screenshot, or save things using a third-party app. [CLS] [SEP] at the end of the day,
it’s best to only share the need-to-know stuff with the people you really
trust — just like you would in real life!
