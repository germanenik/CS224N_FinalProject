### at sync, we are committed to protecting your privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

at sync, we are committed to protecting your privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy lets you know when and how sync (“we”/”us”/”our”) uses,
collects, discloses or processes your personal information when you use our
products and services or visit the sync website www.sync.com (“website”). [CLS] [SEP] to
that end, we have outlined below our ten privacy principles based on the
privacy principles established in canada’s personal information protection and
electronic documents act (pipeda) followed by information we are required to
provide to our users located in the european union according to the european
general data protection regulation (gdpr). [CLS] [SEP]

### sync’s ten privacy principles

personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact
you individually, and other information that sync needs to provide you with
the products and services you have requested. [CLS] [SEP] personal information we collect
typically includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone
number and credit card or payment information. [CLS] [SEP] under certain circumstances, an
ip address may be considered personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

sync has 10 privacy principles, based on those established in the pipeda. [CLS] [SEP] sync
has implemented policies and practices to give effect to these principles. [CLS] [SEP]
sync has implemented procedures to protect personal information, has
established procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries, has
trained its staff and communicated to them information about sync's policies
and practices, and has developed information explaining sync's policies and
procedures. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy tells you about how sync's policies and
procedures comport with each of these principles. [CLS] [SEP]

### principle 1 – accountability

sync is responsible for personal information under its control. [CLS] [SEP] sync has
designated a privacy officer who is accountable for its compliance with our
privacy policy and pipeda. [CLS] [SEP] sync's privacy officer is accountable for our
compliance with pipeda, but other individuals at sync may be responsible for
day-to-day collection and processing of personal information and may also be
delegated to act on behalf of the privacy officer. [CLS] [SEP]

sync may on occasion use outside companies, called third parties, to help us
provide our products or services to you. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of where these third
parties are located, we require that they also comply with pipeda and with
sync's privacy principles. [CLS] [SEP]

### principle 2 – identifying purposes

you have a right to know how your information will be used. [CLS] [SEP] sync will explain
why we need your information before or when we collect it, if the purpose is
not already clear. [CLS] [SEP] we will assume that the purpose is clearly identified when
we use your personal information to:

  * provide you with the products or services you have requested;
  * process your payment, including recurring payments as you request;
  * communicate with you about the products or services you have requested;
  * ensure that you are properly registered to use our products and services and to receive any associated technical support; and
  * inform you of any important product revisions or updates. [CLS] [SEP]

sync will also collect log information that includes your ip address and the
time that you access our service. [CLS] [SEP] this information is stored in log files and
is used for security, to improve performance and for aggregated and
statistical reporting. [CLS] [SEP] this log information is not linked to personal
information gathered elsewhere on the website. [CLS] [SEP]

sync may also use your personal information for secondary purposes such as:

  * letting you know about new or upgraded sync products and services; and
  * inviting you to participate in customer surveys or other opinion-gathering devices. [CLS] [SEP]

aggregate data is general information about groups of customers, and does not
identify individual customers. [CLS] [SEP] sync may combine your information with that of
other customers to generate aggregate data that can be used to improve our
products and services or develop new ones. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may tell a third
party how many users have subscribed to a particular service, but not identify
that you personally are a subscriber. [CLS] [SEP]

sync will not disclose your personal information to any third parties without
your consent, except under the following limited circumstances:

  * as is reasonably required to fulfill your service or product requirements, provided such third parties shall be bound to appropriate privacy requirements;
  * to comply with a legal process such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order or law enforcement request
  * to resolve a contractual dispute regarding your use of any sync product or service;
  * to resolve issues related to the use of your account for illegal activities; or
  * to protect the personal safety of other users or members of the public in an emergency. [CLS] [SEP]

### principle 3 – consent

sync will collect, use and disclose your personal information only with your
knowledge and consent, except where permitted or as required by law or defined
in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we will not rent, sell, or otherwise distribute your
personal information without your permission, unless otherwise defined in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] sync will seek consent when the information is likely to be
considered sensitive. [CLS] [SEP]

you control any future secondary use of your personal information, such as
sharing it with marketers. [CLS] [SEP] you can prevent future secondary use of your
information by “opting out” when sync collects your information or at any time
by simply contacting us. [CLS] [SEP] opting out only applies to the secondary purposes
because we may need to contact you regarding the usability of our services or
notify you of important product revisions or updates. [CLS] [SEP] to change your privacy
preferences, please go to www.sync.com and log into your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### principle 4 – limiting collection

sync will collect personal information only for the purposes we’ve identified
or for the primary uses described above. [CLS] [SEP] we shall collect information by fair
and lawful means only. [CLS] [SEP] we will collect personal information in the following
circumstances:

  * when you subscribe to use our services, whether free or through a paid subscription;
  * when you provide payment information for use with a paid subscription;
  * when you contact sync to request information;
  * when we are provided such information from a third party who you authorized to share such information. [CLS] [SEP]

we will mark as optional any question we ask that seeks information that is
not necessary to provide you with the sync product or service you request. [CLS] [SEP]

sync uses "cookies" to collect information and improve our products and
services. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie is a small data file that is stored on your device. [CLS] [SEP] cookies
cannot be used to see any other data on your computer, nor can they determine
your e-mail address or identity. [CLS] [SEP] we may use "persistent cookies" to save your
registration id and login password for future logins to our service. [CLS] [SEP] we may
use "session cookies" to enable certain features of our service, to better
understand how you interact with our service and to monitor aggregate usage
and web traffic routing on our service. [CLS] [SEP] you can change your browser options to
stop accepting cookies or to prompt for your permission before accepting
cookies. [CLS] [SEP] choosing to decline cookies may affect your access to our products
and services. [CLS] [SEP]

the sync website may include links to third-party web sites. [CLS] [SEP] these third-party
web sites may assign different cookies to you. [CLS] [SEP] those cookies may be used to
track your involvement with the advertising site. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose not to accept
these cookies. [CLS] [SEP] sync does not control these parties, and you should review
their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and
use personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

### principle 5 – limiting use, disclosure, and retention

purposes for which it was collected unless we receive your consent or unless
we are required or permitted to by law. [CLS] [SEP] the content of the files that you

information in response to a legal inquiry or order, we will verify its
validity and disclose only the information that is legally required. [CLS] [SEP] sync will
make reasonable efforts, within the bounds of the law, to notify you should
your personal information be subject to disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]

sync will keep your personal information only for as long as it needs to for
the purposes identified above, as required by law, or as necessary to resolve
any disputes you may have concerning our services. [CLS] [SEP] sync will follow internally

of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to
such information. [CLS] [SEP]

of significant harm to you. [CLS] [SEP]
