# privacy policy

version 0.6

date june 25 2020

### introduction

jagex respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]
this privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data
when you play our games, visit our website, access our mobile platform
(regardless of where you visit it from) or otherwise access any of our
products and services and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law
protects you. [CLS] [SEP]

the general data protection regulation (eu) 2016/679 (“gdpr”) is a regulation
in eu law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the
european union (eu) and the european economic area (eea). [CLS] [SEP] it also addresses
the transfer of personal data outside the eu and eea areas. [CLS] [SEP] the gdpr aims
primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data
and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by
unifying the regulation within the eu. [CLS] [SEP] the data protection act 2018 (“dpa
2018”) sets out the framework for data protection law in the uk. [CLS] [SEP] it updates
and replaces the data protection act 1998 and came into effect on 25 may 2018. [CLS] [SEP]
it sits alongside the gdpr, and tailors how the gdpr applies in the uk - for
example by providing exemptions. [CLS] [SEP] it also sets out separate data protection
rules for law enforcement authorities, extends data protection to some other
areas such as national security and defense, and sets out the information
commissioner’s functions and powers. [CLS] [SEP]

third parties to collect or share data about you. [CLS] [SEP] we do not control these
third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. [CLS] [SEP]
when you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of
every website you visit. [CLS] [SEP]

### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] the data we collect about you

personal data, or personal information, means any information about an
individual from which that person can be identified. [CLS] [SEP] it does not include data
where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). [CLS] [SEP]

we may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about
you which we have grouped together as follows:

  * **identity data** includes but not limited to first name, last name, username or similar identifier, title and date of birth. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **contact data** includes billing address, residential address, email address and telephone numbers. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **transaction data** includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **technical data** commonly known as online identifiers and includes internet protocol (ip) address, unique mobile device identification numbers (such as your media access control (mac) address, identifier for advertising (idfa), and/or international mobile equipment identity (imei), type of device, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and geo location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **profile data** includes your login details, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **usage data** includes information about how you use our website, products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

financial data. [CLS] [SEP]

we also collect, use and share **aggregated data** such as statistical or
demographic data for any purpose. [CLS] [SEP] aggregated data may be derived from your
personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does
**not** directly or indirectly reveal your identity. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may
aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a
specific website feature. [CLS] [SEP] however, if we combine or connect aggregated data
with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we
treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not collect any **special categories of personal data** about you (this
includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical
beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union
membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). [CLS] [SEP] nor
do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences. [CLS] [SEP]

we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the
functionality of our mobile software on your device. [CLS] [SEP] this software may record
information such as how often you play our games, the events that occur within
the games, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the games were
downloaded from. [CLS] [SEP] we do not link the information we store within the analytics
software to any personal information you submit within the games. [CLS] [SEP]

#### if you fail to provide personal data

where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we
may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into
with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). [CLS] [SEP] in this case,
we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify
you if this is the case at the time. [CLS] [SEP]

### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] how is your personal data collected?

  * identity and contact data from data brokers or aggregators based inside **and** outside the eu. [CLS] [SEP]

  * identity and contact data from publicly availably sources such as companies house and the electoral register based inside the eu. [CLS] [SEP]

### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] how we use your personal data

we will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. [CLS] [SEP] most commonly,
we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

  * for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. [CLS] [SEP]

  * where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. [CLS] [SEP]

  * where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. [CLS] [SEP]

generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your
personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing
communications to you. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at
any time by [contacting us](https://relentless-
gdpr-247.relentlessdataprivacy.com/saq/698bf39f-5e25-4af7-aef9-06bf4b6bfcf4). [CLS] [SEP]

#### marketing

we provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly
around marketing and advertising. [CLS] [SEP] we have established the following personal
data control mechanisms:

#### promotional offers from us

we may use your identity, contact, technical, usage and profile data to form a
view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]
this is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for
you (we call this marketing). [CLS] [SEP]

you will receive marketing communications from us if you have subscribed for
an account with us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not
opted out of receiving that marketing. [CLS] [SEP] all of our marketing communications to
you contain an opt out option. [CLS] [SEP]

#### third-party marketing

we will get your explicit opt-in consent before we share your personal data
with any company outside jagex for marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

#### opting out

you can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any
time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to
adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out links on any
marketing message sent to you or by [contacting us](https://relentless-
gdpr-247.relentlessdataprivacy.com/saq/698bf39f-5e25-4af7-aef9-06bf4b6bfcf4)
at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### opting out of advertising id

the identifier for advertising (idfa) is a unique, user-resettable id for
advertising, provided by the mobile device’s operating system. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this
id to enhance serving and targeting capabilities, re-target specific
campaigns, pass the id to our partners. [CLS] [SEP] advertising id does not reveal any
information about the user or the device. [CLS] [SEP] if you prefer to opt-out or reset
your identifier. [CLS] [SEP] for advertising (idfa), please follow these standard
instructions:

  * ios - [opt out of interest-based ads in the app store and apple news](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht202074)
  * android - [opt out of seeing personalized ads](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en)

#### opting out of third-party tailored advertising

if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from
third parties that relate to your interests in our games on your mobile
device, you may opt- out by:

  * adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device
  * resetting your identifier for advertising (idfa) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioural data tied to the previous identifier for advertising (idfa). [CLS] [SEP]
  * visiting the following link: <https://www.appsflyer.com/optout>. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties
within our games even if you opt out of tailored advertising, but they will
not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps. [CLS] [SEP]

#### opting out of geolocation

if you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can
stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's
settings for the games or the “settings” page for the games. [CLS] [SEP]

**opting out of other communications**

when you install our games on your mobile device you can choose to receive
push notifications, which are messages our games send you on your mobile
device even when the game is not on. [CLS] [SEP] you can turn off notifications by
visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page. [CLS] [SEP]

#### cookies

you can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert
you when websites set or access cookies. [CLS] [SEP] if you disable or refuse cookies,
please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not
function properly. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about the cookies we use, please see
[our cookie policy](/en-gb/terms/cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

#### change of purpose

we will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected
it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason
and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

if we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify
you and obtain your consent to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or
consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or
permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] disclosure of your personal data

we may share your personal data with third parties set out below for the
purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above. [CLS] [SEP]

  * specific marketing partners listed [here](/en-gb/terms/third-party-partners). [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. [CLS] [SEP] if a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] your data will only be disclosed for the purposes identified in this privacy notice and for which you have provided implicit or explicit consent unless a law or regulation specifically allows or requires otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] we require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. [CLS] [SEP] all our third-party processing partners are vetted under our third-party due diligence process and have signed data processor contracts with us. [CLS] [SEP]

### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] international transfers

some of our external third parties are based outside the european economic
area ( **eea** ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a
transfer of data outside the eea. [CLS] [SEP]

whenever we transfer your personal data out of the eea, we ensure a similar
degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the
following safeguards is implemented:

  * we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the european commission. [CLS] [SEP]

  * where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the european commission which give personal data the same protection it has in europe. [CLS] [SEP]

  * where we use providers based in the us, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the eu/us privacy shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the europe and the us. [CLS] [SEP]

### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] data security

we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal
data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way,
altered, disclosed or being unavailable. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we limit access to your
personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties
who have a business need to know on the principle of least privilege (polp) . [CLS] [SEP]
they will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are
subject to a duty of confidentiality. [CLS] [SEP] we periodically review all privacy and
security policies and update when necessary in line with changes of the gdpr
or when any new technologies are introduced into our business. [CLS] [SEP] where the
introduction of new technologies results in a high risk to your data we will
perform a data protection impact assessment and will only proceed if meeting
the required levels of security standards. [CLS] [SEP] methods of collecting personal
information are reviewed by management before they are implemented to confirm
that personal information is obtained (a) fairly, without intimidation or
deception, and (b) lawfully, adhering to all relevant rules of law, whether
derived from statute or common law, relating to the collection of personal
information

we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data
breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we
are legally required to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] data retention

**how long will you use my personal data for?**

we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the
purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any
legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. [CLS] [SEP] a copy of our data retention
schedule is available upon request. [CLS] [SEP]

to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider
the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk
of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

by law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including
contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six tax years plus
current tax year as part of our legal obligations to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

in some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see _request
erasure_ below for further information. [CLS] [SEP]

in some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no
longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which
case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] your legal rights

under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
relation to your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we set out below a brief description of such
rights:

  * **to be informed** : individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this is a key transparency requirement under the gdpr and dpa 2018. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy and our cookie policy meet this requirement. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **request access to your personal data** **(commonly known as a “data subject access request”)** : this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **request rectification of your personal data** : this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **request erasure of your personal data** : this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. [CLS] [SEP] note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **object to processing** **of your personal data** : where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms
  * **request restriction of processing your personal data** : this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; or (b) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
  * **request the transfer** **of your personal data to you or to a third party** : we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. [CLS] [SEP] note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **withdraw consent at any time** **where we are relying on consent to process your personal data** : however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. [CLS] [SEP] if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. [CLS] [SEP] we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent

if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please [contact
us](https://relentless-
gdpr-247.relentlessdataprivacy.com/saq/698bf39f-5e25-4af7-aef9-06bf4b6bfcf4). [CLS] [SEP]

#### no fee usually required

you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
any of the other rights). [CLS] [SEP] however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, we may
refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what we may need from you

we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise
any of your other rights). [CLS] [SEP] this is a security measure to ensure that personal
data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. [CLS] [SEP] we may
also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your
request to speed up our response. [CLS] [SEP]

#### time limit to respond

we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. [CLS] [SEP] occasionally it
may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you
have made a number of requests, in which case we will inform you of an
extension period of up to 2 months as stated in the gdpr and dpa 2018. [CLS] [SEP] in this
case, we will keep you informed on progress. [CLS] [SEP]

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] california residents: your california privacy rights

the california consumer privacy act (also referred to as the "ccpa") is a
privacy-centric bill protecting the privacy of california consumers that will
