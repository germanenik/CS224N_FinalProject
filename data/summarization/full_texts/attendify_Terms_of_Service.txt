# attendify terms of service

## updated on june 30, 2020

attendify clients app end users

## attendify clients

#### last updated: june 30th, 2020

please read these terms of service (“terms” or “agreement”) carefully to
ensure that you understand each provision. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement contains a mandatory
individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that
requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes,
rather than jury trials or class actions. [CLS] [SEP]  

by accessing or using the attendify services, you agree to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you
do not wish to be bound by these terms, please discontinue your use of the
services immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] about attendify

we, kitapps, inc. [CLS] [SEP] dba attendify (“attendify”), provide various event
management software solutions to event organizers (each, a “client”) for use
in connection with one or more in-person or virtual events (each, an “event”). [CLS] [SEP]
these solutions include mobile applications, websites, attendee data
management tools and other event-related products (collectively, the
“products”). [CLS] [SEP] our clients may, in turn, make some of these products available
to their customers for the purpose of attending and participating in their
events (“end users”). [CLS] [SEP] we also offer certain support and hosting services
related to the products, as well as the attendify website currently located at
[www.attendify.com](https://attendify.com/) and all subdomains therein (the
“site” and, together with the products and related support and hosting
services, the “services”). [CLS] [SEP]  

### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] who is subject to these terms

these terms apply to your use of the services if you are accessing the
services as a client or on behalf of a client to create and manage one or more
events (together with the client, “you” or “your”). [CLS] [SEP] if you are accessing the
services as an end user, please visit the attendify terms of service
applicable to end users, available at
[https://attendify.com/terms_of_service](https://attendify.com/terms_of_service/). [CLS] [SEP]

### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to these terms

these terms are subject to change at any time, without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP] any
changes that are made to these terms will not apply retroactively and will not
apply to disputes or events occurring before the change is published. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] data privacy

information that we collect through the services about you or any end users is
governed by our [privacy policy](privacy-policy.html), which is incorporated
by reference herein in its entirety. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby acknowledge that you have read
and agree to be bound by our [privacy policy](privacy-policy.html). [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that, in connection with your use of the services, you access,
store, or otherwise process any personal information of end users, you agree
to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances
with respect to such information including, but not limited to, the european
union’s general data protection regulation (2016/ec/679) (the “gdpr”), the
california consumer privacy act (“ccpa”), the children’s online privacy
protection act (“coppa”), and the can-spam act. [CLS] [SEP]

in furtherance, and not by limitation of, the foregoing, if we share
information with you about end users residing in the european union or
switzerland, you represent and warrant that: (i) you will provide at least the
same level of privacy protection as is required by the eu-us privacy shield
principles and the swiss-us privacy shield principles (the “principles”) with
respect to such information; (ii) you will take reasonable and appropriate
steps to ensure that you effectively process the personal information
transferred in a manner consistent with the principles; (iii) you will notify
us if you makes a determination that you can no longer meet your obligation to
provide the same level of protection as is required by the principles; (iv)
upon notice, including under (iii), we may take reasonable and appropriate
steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (v) we may provide a
summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of this
agreement to the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce upon request. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] payment and refund terms

  * **generally.** we offer various products as part of our services. [CLS] [SEP] the following provisions shall apply to your use of the services generally. [CLS] [SEP] if you use one of the special products listed in sections 5(b) or 5(c), certain additional terms listed in those sections will apply to your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

****  

**i.** **fees for the services.** unless client and attendify agree otherwise
in writing, client agrees to pay the fees for the services as specified in
this agreement and on the site (the “fees”). [CLS] [SEP] generally, the fees will consist
either of a one-time charge for “a-la-carte” services or an annual
subscription for a package. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise noted, all annual subscriptions
provide a license to the services for one (1) event, and additional
subscription(s) need to be purchase for any additional events. [CLS] [SEP] the fees are
subject to change from time to time upon 30 days’ notice, which notice may be
provided at any time by posting the changes to the site or otherwise
communicated to you in writing. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the services after the
effective date of such change will constitute your agreement to pay the
updated fees. [CLS] [SEP]  

**ii.** **subscription packages.** if you purchase an annual subscription
package, to the extent that you don’t use all of the benefits of the
subscription package (such as ticket or registration credits) in a given year,
you will not be entitled to a prorated refund of the fees paid, and such
benefits will not rollover to a subsequent year. [CLS] [SEP]  

**iii.** **free trial.** we may offer you a free trial that gives you access
to certain features of the services. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that publishing a mobile
application developed using our services (an “app”) requires a paid account,
and that we may terminate any free trial in our absolute discretion at any
time. [CLS] [SEP]  

**iv.** **payments.** you must pay all fees either in advance (for example, on
an annual subscription) or upon the submission of an invoice to you, as agreed
by you and attendify. [CLS] [SEP] if we agree to invoice you for the services, payment is
due upon receipt of each invoice. [CLS] [SEP] all payments made through the site must be
made via a valid credit card. [CLS] [SEP] if we agree to invoice you for the services,
payment must be made as specified on the invoice. [CLS] [SEP]  

**v.** **late fees.** in the event that you fail to pay to attendify any fees
more than thirty (30) days after they become due, such fees will bear interest
calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser
of (a) one percent (1%) per month, compounded monthly, and (b) the maximum
rate permitted by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]  

**vi.** **refunds of fees.** unless client and attendify agree otherwise in
writing, there will be no refunds or credits of any fees paid by you for any
reason, including, without limitation, for setup fees, partial month or year
of service (in the case of a prepaid annual subscription package),
upgrade/downgrade refunds, refunds for months unused or rejection of an app by
a provider (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP]  

**vii.** **taxes.** all fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties
imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all
such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only united states (federal or state)
taxes on attendify income. [CLS] [SEP]  

  *   * **lead retrieval product.** if you sign up for our lead retrieval product, we offer a revenue sharing option in which we will bill and collect payment from exhibitors or sponsors at your event and remit a percentage of such proceeds to you (the “lead retrieval share”). [CLS] [SEP] the lead retrieval share is subject to change from time to time, and the most up-to-date lead retrieval share will be posted on the site. [CLS] [SEP] we will pay you the lead retrieval share within seven (7) days of the end of your event. [CLS] [SEP] payments will only be made through paypal® and only after we have received the applicable tax forms from you that may be requested by us. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * **event and session registration products.** if you sign up for our event registration and/or session registration products, whether as a standalone “a-la-carte” product or as part of a subscription package, the following terms will apply:  

****  

**i.** you may have the option to charge a fee for registrations and tickets
to an event or an event session (a “session”). [CLS] [SEP] all proceeds, including,
without limitation, ticket face value, attendify’s fees, taxes, and royalties,
from such sales (collectively, "sale proceeds") will be collected by our
third-party payment processing partners, such as stripe® (the “payment
processing partners”). [CLS] [SEP] you hereby consent to such collection. [CLS] [SEP] our payment
processing partners will transfer to you, within such time period that is
consistent with their practices, the sale proceeds for such event less
attendify’s fees (if applicable), the applicable fees charged by the payment
processing partner, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and any other
applicable fees and deductions. [CLS] [SEP]  

**ii.** if you select our “a-la-carte” pricing model, we will charge a fee
based on the number of registrations or tickets offered plus a percentage of
the sale proceeds from such event(s). [CLS] [SEP] such fees will be calculated based upon
the face value of each registration or ticket (not taking into account any
fees charged by the payment processing partner), and you hereby agree to have
our payment processing partners directly remit such fees to us. [CLS] [SEP]  

**iii.** alternatively, you may choose our subscription package model, in
which case you will be entitled to a certain number of tickets or registration
credits, which are non-transferable and any unused tickets or credits will not
be refunded to you or rolled over to a subsequent year. [CLS] [SEP] any fees for a
subscription package will be invoiced to you, and the invoice will be due and
payable upon receipt. [CLS] [SEP] please note that paid tickets or registrations to
sessions are only provided as part of a subscription package, and not our
“a-la-carte” products. [CLS] [SEP]  

**iv.** the collection of sale proceeds shall be subject to and governed by
the terms of such payment processing partners, and attendify assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of payment
processing partners. [CLS] [SEP] you may be required by the payment processing partners to
enter into an agreement directly with such payment processing partners. [CLS] [SEP]  

**v.** except for a ticket that has been refunded pursuant to clause (v)
below, you agree to accept, honor and fulfill all tickets, whether free or
paid, that have been confirmed by attendify through the services. [CLS] [SEP] it is your
sole responsibility to confirm the authenticity of any ticket and to confirm
that any attendee has acquired a valid ticket. [CLS] [SEP]  

**vi.** when posting an event, you must communicate a refund policy for the
event and the sessions, if applicable. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to offer refunds to any
event or session attendees, you authorize our payment processing partners to
issue on your behalf a refund of the sale proceeds (less any fees charged by
the payment processing partner). [CLS] [SEP] all disputes with respect to ticket refunds
are to be handled between client and the attendees of the event and/or
session. [CLS] [SEP]  
  

**vii.** you may not post, through the services, any events (including any
sessions) which: (a) violate or facilitate the violation of any applicable
law, (b) would be prohibited under the rules and regulations of the card
schemes and alternative form of payment frameworks, (c) take place in a
country to which the united states has embargoed goods and/or services of the
same type as the services, and (d) contain any user content that would violate
these terms or our acceptable use policy below. [CLS] [SEP] if we determine, in our sole
discretion, that a posted event violates the previous sentence, we reserve the
right to cancel the event, to suspend or terminate your account and access to
the services and/or to report you to applicable law enforcement agencies for
further action. [CLS] [SEP]  

**viii.** you agree that it is your sole responsibility to determine, collect,
report and remit any taxes (including, without limitation, sales, use and
value-added tax) that may must be collected in connection with your use of the
services. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] responsibility for user content (dmca policy)

we respect the rights of third-party creators and content owners and expect
that you will do the same. [CLS] [SEP] given the nature of the services and the volume of
information submitted, we cannot and do not monitor all messages, data,
information, text, graphics, audio, video or other materials and content of
any kind posted/uploaded/transmitted to or through the services by our users

not be liable for any user content and (b) reserve the right to review,
reject, delete, remove, modify, or edit any user content at any time for any
reason, without liability and without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right, but
are not obligated, to remove user content from the services for any reason,

### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] virtual events

to the extent that you organize events that utilize video and/or audio
streaming and recording functionality as part of the event (a “virtual
event”), you may be provided with the option to record such virtual event. [CLS] [SEP] you
are solely responsible for compliance with all recording laws. [CLS] [SEP] by using the
recording functionality, you give us consent to store recordings for any or
all virtual events that you organize, to the extent that such recordings are
stored in our systems. [CLS] [SEP]

video and/or audio streaming and recording technology is provided by third
parties that are integrated with our services. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the functionality
provided by such third parties is subject to the terms of service, privacy
practices, and related agreements provided by such third parties and we assume
no responsibility for such terms, nor for the actions or practices of such
third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that you choose to organize a virtual event, the photographs and
audiovisual recordings from the virtual event will be treated as your content
as described in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

further, while we obtain consent to use the name, voice and likeness of end
users who have consented to the attendify terms of service applicable to end
users in connection with photographs and audiovisual recordings from virtual
events, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining
such consent from any other individuals or legal entities that may appear in

privacy or rights of publicity, or any claims for consideration or
compensation for such use. [CLS] [SEP]

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] mobile apps

  * **publishing the apps** \- you have two options with respect to publishing an app. [CLS] [SEP] first, you may choose to publish an app through attendify’s registered developer account with one or more mobile platform providers (collectively, “providers”), including, but not limited to, the apple inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“apple”) app store™ and google play™. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to have the app published through attendify’s developer account, attendify will be the sole publisher of the app and the app will appear as an attendify application with each provider. [CLS] [SEP] second, you may choose to self-publish an app with a provider using your own developer account. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that if you choose to self-publish an app, additional fees may apply. [CLS] [SEP] attendify will use commercially reasonable efforts to have your app(s) approved by the applicable providers. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do not and cannot guarantee acceptance by a provider, and therefore assume no responsibility for rejection of any app by a provider. [CLS] [SEP] if your app is denied by a provider, you will be notified. [CLS] [SEP] however, you will not be provided any refund of any fees paid by you under any circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **accessing the apps** \- our apps are generally accessible via a mobile device that is compatible with our mobile service. [CLS] [SEP] we do not warrant that any app will be compatible with all mobile devices. [CLS] [SEP] we grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of each app for one account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your sole use. [CLS] [SEP] you may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the app, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute, transfer or otherwise make available the app to any third party or use the app to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the app; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the app, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the app, or features that enforce limitations on use of the app; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the app. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the app, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the app that you are using on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these terms will apply to all such upgrades. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing license grant is not a sale of the app or any copy thereof, and we or our third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the app and any copy or portion of the app. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to comply with all united states and foreign laws related to use of the app and the services. [CLS] [SEP] standard carrier data charges may apply to your use of the app. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **apps from itunes** \- the following also applies to any app you acquire from us from the itunes store (“itunes-sourced software”): you acknowledge and agree that these terms are solely between you and us, not apple, and that apple has no responsibility for the itunes-sourced software or content thereof. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the itunes-sourced software must comply with the apple app store terms. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the itunes-sourced software. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * **apple developer account** \- in the event that you need to share access to your apple developer account with attendify for any reason, and if there is more than one app in such developer account, then attendify agrees that it shall: (i) not access any app other than an attendify-powered app in the developer account; (ii) not modify or alter any non-attendify-powered app or the code with respect thereto; (iii) only use the access to your developer account to submit, manage and update attendify-powered apps; and (iv) agrees to maintain as your confidential information any information related to non-attendify-powered apps which it may inadvertently discover. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] intellectual property

tortious behavior, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if we
and/or our suppliers had been advised of the possibility of damages. [CLS] [SEP] some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above
exclusion may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### 15\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

in no event shall we or our suppliers or licensors be liable for lost profits
or any special, incidental or consequential damages (however arising,
including negligence) arising out of or in connection with this agreement or

limitations of liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the
