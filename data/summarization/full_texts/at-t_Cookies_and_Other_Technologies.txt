# cookies and other technologies

#### definitions

let's start with what we mean when we use the word "cookie" and other related
terms:

  * **cookies** are small data files. [CLS] [SEP] websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to that site. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are created to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations. [CLS] [SEP]

there are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:

    * disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. [CLS] [SEP] you’ll need to perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers or web browsers, or clear or erase the digital "cookie" that lets us know you opted out. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **local storage cookies.** local storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to store http state data. [CLS] [SEP] it is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs in a user’s web browser. [CLS] [SEP] local storage on att.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in html pages from our domains. [CLS] [SEP] local storage data is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **flash cookies** (also called local shared objects or "lsos") are similar to cookies, except that they can store more complex data. [CLS] [SEP] they are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage, and other similar services. [CLS] [SEP] flash cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. [CLS] [SEP] if disabled, these services may not function correctly. [CLS] [SEP] while browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash cookies operate differently. [CLS] [SEP] please note that setting the flash player to restrict or limit acceptance of flash lsos may reduce or impede the functionality of some flash applications. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the [adobe website](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html) and make changes at [global storage settings panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html). [CLS] [SEP]
  * **web beacons** are small graphic images on a web page or in an e-mail. [CLS] [SEP] they can be used for things like recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing campaign performs. [CLS] [SEP]
  * a **widget** is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. [CLS] [SEP] it can provide real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. [CLS] [SEP] widgets are often provided by a third party and allow them to collect data about users viewing that page. [CLS] [SEP]
  * a **server log** records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in improving web page performance and introducing new features. [CLS] [SEP] for example, it may record which search terms you’ve entered, or the links you’ve clicked on. [CLS] [SEP] it may also record your browser information, such as your ip address, device type, how long you spend on a web page, and your browser's cookies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * some websites have “ **social network or other third-party plug-ins**.” these plug-ins may provide information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. [CLS] [SEP] it may also apply even if you don’t have an account with them. [CLS] [SEP] social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser. [CLS] [SEP] this might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, ip address and the url of the web page where the plug-in appears. [CLS] [SEP] if you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

#### managing cookies

most browsers will allow you to delete, disable and choose what cookies can be
placed on your computer. [CLS] [SEP] if you want more information about controlling
