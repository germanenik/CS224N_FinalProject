# cloudflare cookie policy

_last updated: april 15, 2020_

_this cloudflare cookie policy (“policy”) outlines the general policy,
practices, and types of cookies that cloudflare, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“cloudflare,” “we,”
“us,” or “our”) may use to improve our services and your experience when
visiting our websites. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this policy, capitalized terms used
but not defined in this policy have the meanings given in our[privacy
policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)._

* * *

our websites and services use cookies and other similar technologies
(collectively in this policy, "cookies"), in order to provide a better service
to you, to help keep your account safe, and to generally improve our websites
and services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies perform essential functions, such as ensuring a webpage
loads correctly and securely. [CLS] [SEP] they also help us provide you with a consistent
and efficient experience. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may use cookies to remember which
language you prefer, to remember that you are a repeat visitor so we can
direct you to the appropriate part of our websites, or to present you with
services that are matched to your preferences. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. [CLS] [SEP]
they are used by many websites to store and receive identifiers and other
information on devices, such as a handheld phone or computer. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn
more about cookies and their functions generally by visiting an information
website such as [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org). [CLS] [SEP]

we also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our
marketing communications to determine engagement. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies may be set by
us or by third parties with whom we have partnered to assist in our marketing
efforts. [CLS] [SEP]

we use four categories of cookies: strictly necessary, functional,
performance, and targeting. [CLS] [SEP] strictly necessary cookies are required to deliver
security and enable core site functionality and cannot be turned off. [CLS] [SEP] you may
view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking
on the “cookie preferences” link in the footer of the cloudflare homepage at
[cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, however, you may be
able to delete cookies yourself through your browser’s cookie manager. [CLS] [SEP] to do
so, please follow the instructions provided by your web browser. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that disabling cookies will reset your session, disable auto-login, and may
adversely affect the availability and functionality of our websites and the
services we can provide to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### strictly necessary cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

strictly necessary cookies are essential to providing the cloudflare websites
and services to you and cannot be turned off. [CLS] [SEP] they provide necessary security
settings or help you use our websites’ features and services as expected
(including remembering your cookie consent preferences). [CLS] [SEP] cloudflare places
strictly necessary cookies both on cloudflare websites as well as on our
customers’ websites. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, when you visit our websites or our customers’ websites, as part
of our services, we may place "_cfduid" cookies, bot detection cookies (such
as "_cf_bm" and cookies for captcha), and a load balancing cookie (_cflb) on
the computers of visitors to our websites and of our end users. [CLS] [SEP] we do this in
order to identify malicious visitors to our websites and our customers’
websites, to assist with web-traffic filtration, and to reduce the chance of
blocking legitimate users. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about these cookies
[here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-
us/articles/200170156-understanding-the-cloudflare-cookies). [CLS] [SEP] you cannot turn
off strictly necessary cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

### functional cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

functional cookies allow us to remember choices you make about the kind of
experience you want on our websites and to provide you with a more
personalized experience. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a functional cookie is required to
remember which language you prefer. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to opt out of these
cookies, but if you do, various functions of the websites or services may be
unavailable to you or may not work as intended. [CLS] [SEP]

### performance. [CLS] [SEP]

their performance and design. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies provide us with aggregated
statistical information such as number of page visits, page load speeds, how
long a user spends on a particular page, and the types of browsers or devices
used to access our websites. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may use cookies to understand

images, in our email messages to determine whether the messages were opened
