you do not agree to all of the following, you may not use or access the

disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding, individual
arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit
or class-wide arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**will these terms ever change?**

we are constantly trying to improve our services, so these terms may need to
change along with our services. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change the terms at
any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at
inrupt.com, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t agree with the new terms, you are free to reject them;
unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] if
you use the services in any way after a change to the terms is effective, that
means you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]

“feedback”). [CLS] [SEP] additionally, inrupt may collect certain analytics or usage

inrupt the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and
distribute the feedback and usage data, as well as all other rights necessary
to use and exercise all rights in that feedback and usage data in connection
with the services. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free,
perpetual, sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide. [CLS] [SEP]

**who is responsible for what i see and do on the services?**

any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through
the services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content

and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or

law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “a general release does not

we’re always trying to improve our services, so they may change over time. [CLS] [SEP] we

all of the services. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to remove any content from the
services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if
someone alleges you contributed that content in violation of these terms), in
our sole discretion, and without notice. [CLS] [SEP]

**do the services cost anything?**

the services are currently provided free of charge for users, but we reserve
the right to charge for certain or all services in the future. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify
you before any services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you
wish to continue using such services, you must pay all applicable fees for
such services. [CLS] [SEP]

you’re free to do that at any time. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to our [privacy

services for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] inrupt has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any
of the restrictions set forth in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

shall survive termination. [CLS] [SEP] by way of example, all of the following will
survive termination: any obligation you have to indemnify us, any limitations
on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property
rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation
the arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**what else do i need to know?**

_warranty disclaimer_ _._ inrupt and its licensors, suppliers, partners,
parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective
officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees,
representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and
assigns (inrupt and all such parties together, the “inrupt parties”) make no
representations or warranties concerning the services, including without
limitation regarding any content contained in or accessed through the
services, and the inrupt parties will not be responsible or liable for the
accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in
or accessed through the services or any claims, actions, suits procedures,
costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way
related to your participation in, the services. [CLS] [SEP] the inrupt parties make no
representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of
services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the
services. [CLS] [SEP] the services and content are provided by inrupt (and its licensors
and suppliers) on an “as-is” basis, without warranties of any kind, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that
use of the services will be uninterrupted or error-free. [CLS] [SEP] some states do not
allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_limitation of liability_. [CLS] [SEP] to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law,
under no circumstances and under no legal theory (including, without
limitation, tort, contract, strict liability, or otherwise) shall any of the
inrupt parties be liable to you or to any other person for (a) any indirect,
special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages of any kind, including
damages for lost profits, business interruption, loss of data, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or computer failure or
malfunction, (b) any substitute goods, services or technology, (c) any amount,
in the aggregate, in excess of two hundred fifty ($250) dollars or (d) any
matter beyond our reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] some states do not allow the exclusion
or limitation of incidental or consequential or certain other damages, so the
above limitation and exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_indemnity_. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to indemnify and hold the inrupt parties harmless from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and
consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from
or in any way related to any claims relating to your violation of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“claim”), we will attempt to
provide notice of the claim to the contact information we have for your
account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or
reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder). [CLS] [SEP]

_assignment_. [CLS] [SEP] you may not assign, delegate or transfer these terms or your
rights or obligations hereunder, or your services account, in any way (by
operation of law or otherwise) without inrupt's prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] we may
transfer, assign, or delegate these terms and our rights and obligations
without consent. [CLS] [SEP]

_choice of law_. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are governed by and will be construed under the
federal arbitration act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the
commonwealth of massachusetts, without regard to the conflicts of laws
provisions thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

**_arbitration agreement_** _._ please read the following arbitration
agreement carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and
claims with inrupt and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from
inrupt. [CLS] [SEP] both you and inrupt acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any
dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these terms,
inrupt's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors
(“personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these terms, and that upon your
acceptance of these terms, personnel will have the right (and will be deemed
to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as the third-
party beneficiary hereof. [CLS] [SEP]

_(a) arbitration rules; applicability of arbitration agreement_. [CLS] [SEP] the parties
shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or
disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these terms
directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to
either party initiating arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if such negotiations do not resolve the
dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in suffolk county,
massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will proceed in the english language, in
accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules and procedures (the
“rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial
experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
disputes. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of jams
arbitrators in accordance with such rules. [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award rendered by
such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) _costs of arbitration_. [CLS] [SEP] the rules will govern payment of all arbitration
fees. [CLS] [SEP] inrupt will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five
thousand ($75,000) dollars. [CLS] [SEP] inrupt will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs
in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) _small claims court; infringement_. [CLS] [SEP] either you or inrupt may assert
claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in suffolk county,
massachusetts or any united states county where you live or work. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore,
notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party
shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any
time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or
threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) _waiver of jury trial_. [CLS] [SEP] you and inrupt waive any constitutional and
statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP]
you and inrupt are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to
very limited review by a court. [CLS] [SEP] in any litigation between you and inrupt over
whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and inrupt waive all
rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
judge. [CLS] [SEP]

(e) _waiver of class or consolidated actions_. [CLS] [SEP] all claims and disputes within
the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an
individual basis and not on a class basis. [CLS] [SEP] claims of more than one customer or
user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of
any other customer or user. [CLS] [SEP] if however, this waiver of class or consolidated
actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor inrupt is entitled
to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as
set forth in (g) below. [CLS] [SEP] ****

(f) _opt-out_. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to opt out of the provisions of this section
by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following
address: inrupt inc., c/o gunderson dettmer, one marina park drive, suite 900,
boston ma 02210 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] you must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email
address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a
clear statement that you want to opt out of these terms’ arbitration
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

(g) _exclusive venue_. [CLS] [SEP] if you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any
circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or
inrupt to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject
matter of these terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will
not apply to either party, and both you and inrupt agree that any judicial
proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or
federal courts located in, respectively, suffolk county, massachusetts, or the
federal district in which that county falls. [CLS] [SEP]

(h) _severability_. [CLS] [SEP] if the prohibition against class actions and other claims
brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be
unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this arbitration
agreement section will be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement will
survive the termination of your relationship with inrupt. [CLS] [SEP]

_miscellaneous_. [CLS] [SEP] you will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and
reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated
with your activity in connection with the services, provided that the inrupt
may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for
itself as it sees fit. [CLS] [SEP] the failure of either you or us to exercise, in any
way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
hereunder. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of these terms are found to be unenforceable or
invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent
necessary, so that these terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect
and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP] you and inrupt agree that these terms are the complete and
exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and inrupt, and
that these terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral
agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject
matter of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an
employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of inrupt, and you do not have any
authority of any kind to bind inrupt in any respect whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]

you and inrupt agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under
these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
