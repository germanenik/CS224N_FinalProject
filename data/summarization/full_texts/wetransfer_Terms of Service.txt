## simple speak introduction for terms of service

you’re busy. [CLS] [SEP] we get it. [CLS] [SEP] so we’ve summed up our terms of service in a few
simple sentences. [CLS] [SEP] they don’t replace the official legal stuff, but they will
give you an idea of what’s in there. [CLS] [SEP] any questions or concerns – please
contact us. [CLS] [SEP]

here are the headlines (imagine them with a clock bonging in the background if
you like):

  * you have to be 16 to use our tools. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your content is yours – you own it, and you are responsible for it. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll only do what’s needed for our services to work properly... [CLS] [SEP]
  * ...unless you are doing something illegal, in which case we can block and/or delete your stuff, and suspend your accounts. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may make changes to our terms, service and/or fees from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if you have an account and don’t like something we change, you can always cancel at any time. [CLS] [SEP]
  * and we should mention that you use our service at your own risk; we are not liable for any damages if things go wrong. [CLS] [SEP]

and that’s it. [CLS] [SEP] seems fair right? you do you, we’ll do us and everything will
be fine. [CLS] [SEP]

    1. [CLS] [SEP] if you use a paid subscription service, the initial subscription term starts once the fees due have been paid in full. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] we may introduce or change the fees for the services from time to time, for which we will give you advance notice. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a fixed term and price subscription, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree with the price change, you must cancel your subscription and stop using the services by the end of the then-current service term. [CLS] [SEP] if you continue to use the services after the price change goes into effect, you agree to pay the changed price. [CLS] [SEP] fee introductions will require your prior consent and registration. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] depending on the payment method you choose, the issuer of the payment method may charge you certain fees relating to the processing of your payment. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] you can change your payment method in your account settings of the respective service or by contacting our [help center](https://wetransfer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us). [CLS] [SEP]

    5. [CLS] [SEP] wetransfer may suspend or cancel the services to you if a payment is not successfully settled (for instance in case of insufficient funds, expiration of credit cards, a change in payment details or otherwise). [CLS] [SEP] suspension or cancellation of the services for non-payment can result in a loss of access to and use of your account and your content. [CLS] [SEP]

    6. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribe and pay us through the apple app store or google play store, the terms of apple or google may also apply. [CLS] [SEP]

  8. [CLS] [SEP] ### term and cancellation of a subscription

    1. [CLS] [SEP] the initial subscription term varies depending on your choice and/or the service it applies to. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to cancel your subscription during the first 14 days, unless you start using the service during this period whereby you waive your right to cancel. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] the subscription period will be renewed automatically for the selected subscription period, unless you have cancelled your subscription on time (before the last day of your subscription). [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] in case of cancellation you will continue to have access to the services until the end of your paid subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] for instance: if the commencement date of your monthly subscription is 2 february and you cancel your subscription on 17 october, you will continue to have access until 2 november. [CLS] [SEP]

    5. [CLS] [SEP] pro pass is linked to your wetransfer pro subscription. [CLS] [SEP] so if you cancel your subscription you will lose access to paste pro and collect pro. [CLS] [SEP]

    6. [CLS] [SEP] cancellation does not give you any right to reimbursement of (part of) the subscription fee, unless local mandatory consumer law obliges to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

    7. [CLS] [SEP] in case your subscription is automatically renewed for a period of more than three (3) months, you will have the right to cancel the subscription at any time after such renewal with a cancellation term of one (1) month. [CLS] [SEP] in case of cancellation based on this clause you may request reimbursement of part of the subscription fee. [CLS] [SEP] this means that you pay for the period until the cancellation enters into force, based on the standard monthly fee for the respective service. [CLS] [SEP]

    8. [CLS] [SEP] upon cancellation or if a payment is not successfully settled (for instance due to expiration or insufficient funds), your account will be deactivated after the end of your subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] you will then not have access to your personal data, address book and any content stored using the service(s). [CLS] [SEP] you can reactivate your subscription at any time in your account settings by making payment within four weeks after deactivation. [CLS] [SEP] your subscription will then be renewed as from the day of reactivation. [CLS] [SEP]

    9. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not reactivate your subscription within the term set out above, any of your content stored using the service(s) and any of your information, including your personal content, settings, address book and any files stored for transfer may have been automatically and permanently deleted from our servers. [CLS] [SEP]

    10. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribe through the apple app store, the terms of apple may apply to the term and cancellation of your subscription instead of the terms in this clause. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] ### content ownership, permissions and responsibility

    1. [CLS] [SEP] wetransfer does not claim any ownership of the content you create, use, store or share through the services and you are solely responsible for it.
