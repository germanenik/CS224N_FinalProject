collect, use, disclose, share, and protect your information, and your choices
about the collection and use of your information. [CLS] [SEP]

when you visit or use the services, you expressly consent to the collection,
use, storage, processing, and disclosure of your information, including
personal information, as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

capitalized terms that are not defined in this privacy policy have the meaning
given them in our [terms of use](/wikihow:terms-of-use "wikihow:terms of
use"). [CLS] [SEP] if there is something in this policy or the terms of use that you
disagree with, you should not access or use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

##

how we collect and use information

we collect the following types of information about you:

_information you provide us directly_ :  
we ask for certain information such as:

  * your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and email address when you register for a wikihow account, or if you correspond with us. [CLS] [SEP] we collect your email address when you choose to sign up for our newsletters. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may also retain any messages you send through the service, and may collect information you provide in user content you post to the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the service. [CLS] [SEP] your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. [CLS] [SEP] once published, your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed entirely from the service. [CLS] [SEP]

  
_information we may receive from third parties_ :  
we may receive information about you from third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

  * for example, if you access our websites or service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through facebook connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the wikihow application, linking your account to the wikihow service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to wikihow. [CLS] [SEP]
  * this information could include, but is not limited to, the user id associated with your account (for example, your facebook uid), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user ids, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join wikihow. [CLS] [SEP] you should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the wikihow service. [CLS] [SEP] you may also unlink your third party account from the service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. [CLS] [SEP]

  
inviting a friend to use wikihow:

  * wikihow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the service through our “invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that by inviting a friend to wikihow through the “invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. [CLS] [SEP] since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication. [CLS] [SEP]

  
finding your friends on the service:

  * wikihow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with wikihow accounts through a “find friends” feature. [CLS] [SEP] the “find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as twitter or facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on wikihow. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide wikihow access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using wikihow. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our service. [CLS] [SEP] note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on wikihow. [CLS] [SEP]

  
analytics information:

services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the service. [CLS] [SEP] these
tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the
pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the
service. [CLS] [SEP] we collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such
that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual
user. [CLS] [SEP]

availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. [CLS] [SEP]

when you access the service by or through a mobile device, we may access,
collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include gps

the location of your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] location data may convey to us information
about how you browse and use the service. [CLS] [SEP] some features of the service,
particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or

for posting to the service becomes available to the public and cannot be
removed, except by wikihow in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] once posted on wikihow,
user content may not be removable from public view, as copies may remain

order to attribute your contribution to the service. [CLS] [SEP] a selection of trusted
users with administrative powers on wikihow have the ability to review ip

blocked@wikihow.com forward to a group of trusted users, who will use your
email address to reply to the email. [CLS] [SEP]

**what happens in the event of a change of control:**  
we may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the
company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or
businesses. [CLS] [SEP] your information such as customer names and email addresses, user
content and other user information related to the service may be among the

also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of
corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions,
reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving
all or a portion of the company. [CLS] [SEP]

**instances where we are required to share your information:**  
wikihow will disclose your information where required to do so by law or

**sharing certain service type information we collect about you:**  
we may share certain service type information, including information obtained

and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and urls,
platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business

**ads on wikihow:**  
we may also share certain information such as your location, browser, cookie
data, and other data relating to your use of our service with our business
partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]
wikihow may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve
advertisements on the service. [CLS] [SEP] these third-party ad servers or ad networks use
technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad
links that appear on the service, and will automatically receive your ip
address when they do so. [CLS] [SEP] they may also use other technologies (such as
cookies, javascript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see
above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and
usage patterns on the service and on other websites, and to measure the
effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content
delivered to you. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, google uses dart cookies in order to deliver ads to you through
the service. [CLS] [SEP] google's use of the dart cookie enables it and its partners to
serve ads to you based on your visit to the service and previous websites that
you may have visited. [CLS] [SEP] other advertising networks also use similar cookies,
clear gifs, or other mechanisms to deliver targeted advertising to you through
the service. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete these cookies by following the instructions here. [CLS] [SEP]
you may opt out of use of google’s dart cookie and cookies placed by network
advertising initiative (nai) certified ad networks
[here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). [CLS] [SEP] opting out of
these cookies will be effective not only on the service, but on all websites
with nai certified advertising networks. [CLS] [SEP] however, these opt-outs will be
ineffective on networks that are not nai certified. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that an advertiser may ask wikihow to show an ad to a certain
audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). [CLS] [SEP] in that
situation, wikihow or our advertising partners determines the target audience
and wikihow serves the advertising to that audience and only provides
anonymous data to the advertiser. [CLS] [SEP] if you respond to such an ad, the advertiser
or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they
are trying to reach. [CLS] [SEP] to enhance your user experience or help us improve and
measure our effectiveness, wikihow may embed code from third parties on the
service. [CLS] [SEP] examples of such parties may include

    

  * facebook
  * twitter
  * pinterest
  * google
  * youtube

these third parties may collect information about you including ip address,
cookies in ways wikihow does not control. [CLS] [SEP]

the wikihow privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
activities of third-parties. [CLS] [SEP] please consult the respective privacy policies of
such third parties or contact such third parties for more information. [CLS] [SEP]
