# terms and conditions for mcdonald’s online services (usa)

last updated: march 13, 2017  
(mcdonald’s address update: january 18, 2019; non-substantive update for
accessibility: may 15, 2019)

**important: please carefully read and understand these terms and conditions
(“terms”). [CLS] [SEP] they contain anarbitration agreement, jury and class action
waivers, limitations on mcdonald’s liability and other provisions that affect
your legal rights.**

by installing, accessing or using any websites, mobile apps, email newsletters
and subscriptions, and other digital properties on which these terms are
posted or referenced (together, “online services”), you are entering into a
binding agreement with mcdonald’s usa, llc ( “mcdonald’s”, “we” or “us”),
which controls and operates the online services from its headquarters at 110
north carpenter street, chicago, illinois 60607. [CLS] [SEP]

by accepting these terms, you also understand and consent to [mcdonald’s
privacy statement](/us/en-us/privacy.html), which is incorporated into, and
part of, this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] our privacy statement describes how we collect, use
and share information. [CLS] [SEP]

by accepting these terms, you understand and agree that, as stated in section
9, you are waiving your right to resolve any dispute through other processes
that could be available to you, such as court actions or administrative
proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] it also means that you are waiving your rights to a trial by jury
or to combine your dispute with others in a class action. [CLS] [SEP]

the online services are not intended to be used by, or targeted to, anyone
under the age of 13 years old. [CLS] [SEP] you must be at least 13 years old to use the
online services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are at least 13 years old but not yet 18 years old (or
the legal age of majority if different in your jurisdiction), then you must
review these terms with your parent or guardian and they must understand and
agree to these terms in order for you to use the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you or your parent or guardian do not agree to these terms, then you must
immediately stop using the online services and request that mcdonald’s close
any online services account that you have created. [CLS] [SEP] you can request account
deletion by sending an email to
[contact.privacy@us.mcd.com](mailto:contact.privacy@us.mcd.com), please
include the email address of the account that you want deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] about the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

### availability of products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald's products and services are available in many parts of the world. [CLS] [SEP]
however, the online services may describe products and services that are not
available worldwide. [CLS] [SEP]

### obey the rules of the road. [CLS] [SEP]

whenever you use the online services, you must obey the rules of the road and
all applicable rules and regulations. [CLS] [SEP] **you must not use the online services
while driving or while behind the wheel or controls of a vehicle that is
moving or not in “park”**. [CLS] [SEP] in the interest of safety at all times, you should
only use the online services when it is lawful and safe to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

### you are responsible for your devices and accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for any devices, software and services needed to use the
online services. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s does not guarantee that the online services will
fully function on any particular device or with any particular software. [CLS] [SEP] you
are also responsible for any messaging and data charges, fees and taxes for
your use of the online services, including when we communicate with you by
text, email or other means that you choose. [CLS] [SEP] you may only use the online
services with devices that you own or control and using only the authorized
operating system (e.g., apple iphone os for apple devices). [CLS] [SEP] if you create an
online services account, you are responsible for keeping the account secure
and for all activity under the account. [CLS] [SEP] you can only use one online services
account and must keep your account information accurate at all times. [CLS] [SEP]

### mcdonald’s right to update or terminate the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand and consent that (with or without notice) mcdonald’s may
update, modify or terminate the online services (or your access to them) from
time to time, including by pushing updates to (or removing functionality or
access from) any mcdonald’s mobile app that you have installed on your device. [CLS] [SEP]

### updates to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald's may also update these terms at any time and at its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
if mcdonald’s makes material changes to the terms, we will notify you by any
reasonable means such as by posting the new terms in the online service. [CLS] [SEP] if
you do not agree to the changed terms, then you must immediately stop using
the online services and request that mcdonald’s close any online services
account that you have created. [CLS] [SEP] to close your account, you can visit
[www.mcdonalds.com/contact](/us/en-us/contact-us.html) or email us at
[contact.privacy@us.mcd.com](mailto:contact.privacy@us.mcd.com). [CLS] [SEP]

### independent businesses own and operate many restaurants. [CLS] [SEP]

while mcdonald’s operates and controls the online services, it is not
responsible for the operation of most restaurants. [CLS] [SEP] most restaurants are
instead owned and operated by independent franchisees of mcdonald’s and some
are operated by mcdonald’s subsidiaries (such franchisees and subsidiaries are
together, “restaurants”). [CLS] [SEP] each restaurant is solely and independently
responsible for its legal and regulatory compliance, for any issues relating
to the supply of the products to you, and for any employment related matters
in the restaurant. [CLS] [SEP]

### links to job opportunities from the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald's and all restaurants are equal opportunity employers committed to
diverse workforces. [CLS] [SEP] the online services may provide links to job opportunities
posted by mcdonald’s or restaurants. [CLS] [SEP] these opportunities are with the
restaurant alone and not with mcdonald’s or its parent company (mcdonald’s
corporation). [CLS] [SEP] this means that the restaurant that posted the opportunity is
alone responsible for setting the job requirements, all hiring decisions, and
all other employment related matters in its business. [CLS] [SEP] neither mcdonald’s nor
its parent company receives a copy of any application you submit to a
restaurant that is a franchisee, neither controls whether you receive an
interview or are hired, and neither controls franchisees’ employment policies
and practices. [CLS] [SEP] neither mcdonald’s nor its parent company employs independent
franchisees. [CLS] [SEP] if you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that
franchisee, and not mcdonald’s or its parent company (mcdonald’s corporation),
will be your employer. [CLS] [SEP]

### how to contact us. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have any questions or comments regarding the online services, please
refer to the contact us section in the online services or you can always visit
[www.mcdonalds.com/contact](/us/en-us/contact-us.html). [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] our information practices and communications with you. [CLS] [SEP]

### mcdonald’s privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms incorporate [mcdonald’s privacy statement](/us/en-us/privacy.html)
as part of the terms. [CLS] [SEP] our privacy statement describes our information
practices, including how we collect, use and share information. [CLS] [SEP]

### how we communicate with you. [CLS] [SEP]

through the online services, you may opt in to receive emails, text messages
to the mobile number you provide to us or push notifications from mcdonald’s. [CLS] [SEP]
when you opt in to any of these types of communications, you understand and
consent that that you will receive marketing, transactional and other messages
from mcdonald’s. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s may use the information you have provided to us to
communicate with you in accordance with [mcdonald’s privacy
statement](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/privacy.html). [CLS] [SEP]

### opting out of communications generally. [CLS] [SEP]

you have a choice in how we communicate with you. [CLS] [SEP] you can generally find your
communication preferences with instructions on how to opt out in the profile
section of the online service that you use. [CLS] [SEP] you may also have the ability to
change your communication preferences using your device settings. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
our communications themselves may include the opportunity to opt out. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand and agree that you may need to separately manage your communication
preferences for each communication method. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you opt out of
receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if
you’ve opted in to receiving them. [CLS] [SEP] while we do our best to offer convenient
methods for you to manage your communications preferences, you may need to
separately adjust your preferences for each online service. [CLS] [SEP] please note that
for some account-related and transactional communications, the only way to
stop receiving these communications may be to close your online services
account. [CLS] [SEP] lastly, please note that if you are receiving communications from a
mcdonald’s franchisee, then you will need to opt out from them directly. [CLS] [SEP]

### additional information on text messages. [CLS] [SEP]

when you opt in to any of our text message programs, you understand that such
text message programs are separately governed by [mcdonald’s text messaging
program terms & conditions](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/terms-and-
conditions.html#text-messaging-anchor). [CLS] [SEP] you understand and consent that you
will receive text messages from an automated system. [CLS] [SEP] you further understand
that your consent is not required to make any purchase. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to
withdraw your consent and unsubscribe, please text stop to the appropriate
short code or visit
[www.mcdonalds.com/contact](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/contact-
us.html) or email us at
[contact.privacy@us.mcd.com](mailto:contact.privacy@us.mcd.com). [CLS] [SEP] for more
information, please visit [mcdonald’s text messaging program terms &
conditions](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/terms-and-conditions.html#text-
messaging-anchor). [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] sending orders to restaurants. [CLS] [SEP]

this section applies to any orders you place using the online services. [CLS] [SEP] please
read this section before you send any orders to restaurants using the online
services. [CLS] [SEP] please note that ordering may not be available in all online
services. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to the faqs for more information on ordering. [CLS] [SEP]

### about ordering. [CLS] [SEP]

the purpose of ordering is to provide customers with a convenient way of
building orders for products in advance and submitting their orders by
checking in at a participating restaurant. [CLS] [SEP] you must register an online
services account in order to use ordering. [CLS] [SEP] before you submit an order, you
must register a credit card or debit card (either one, a “payment card”) to
use with your orders. [CLS] [SEP] not all restaurants may choose to make their products
available via ordering. [CLS] [SEP] you may need to enable location services on your
device in order for ordering to function properly. [CLS] [SEP]

### registering your payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald’s and the restaurants use third party providers to securely store
your payment card information and process your payments to restaurants. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand and agree that, when you register a payment card, mcdonald’s or its
third party providers may verify that the payment card you registered is
valid. [CLS] [SEP] you also understand and agree that when you use ordering to make a
purchase from a restaurant, that restaurant will be the merchant of record. [CLS] [SEP]
restaurants may require information other than your order code to verify your
purchase. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age and have
all legal rights to use all payment cards you register. [CLS] [SEP]

### you purchase products directly from restaurants. [CLS] [SEP]

when you use ordering, you submit orders directly to a participating
restaurant and the contract for supplying the products will be between you and
the restaurant that accepts your order. [CLS] [SEP] the restaurant where you collect your
products is responsible for preparing the products and providing them to you. [CLS] [SEP]
you further understand and agree that you are purchasing directly from
restaurants (and not mcdonald’s or any other members of the mcdonald’s system)
and that neither mcdonald’s nor any other members of the mcdonald’s system
have any responsibility arising out of or related to any products that you
purchase from restaurants using ordering. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s corporation (which is
mcdonald’s parent company), its subsidiaries, affiliates, their franchisees,
agents, representatives, and agencies and their officers, directors, and
employees are together, “members of the mcdonald’s system”. [CLS] [SEP]

### about the products in the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

all products are subject to availability at the restaurant where you collect
your order. [CLS] [SEP] some restaurants do not sell all products. [CLS] [SEP] images of products and
packaging on the online services are examples only and may not be identical to
the product or packaging you receive from a restaurant. [CLS] [SEP] differences may be due
your device’s display of colors or factors such as the ingredients used, the
supplier, the region of the country, and the season of the year. [CLS] [SEP]

### about the prices in ordering. [CLS] [SEP]

each restaurant independently determines its own prices and independently
applies any additional taxes and fees as required by law. [CLS] [SEP] certain offers and
pricing may not be available for all orders at all locations. [CLS] [SEP] in the event you
discover an error in the price of a product charged to you, please contact the
restaurant where you purchased the product to seek a refund of the difference. [CLS] [SEP]

### building, confirming and sending your order to a restaurant. [CLS] [SEP]

you can use ordering to build your order and send it to a participating
restaurant that you select. [CLS] [SEP] you do not make your purchase until you check in
at a restaurant, and your payment card will not be charged until you check in
at a restaurant. [CLS] [SEP] orders made must be collected in person from the restaurant. [CLS] [SEP]

### checking in at a restaurant and making your purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

you can check in at any participating restaurant, even if you selected a
different restaurant when you built your order. [CLS] [SEP] you make your purchase from a
restaurant when you complete your check in at that restaurant. [CLS] [SEP]

### updated order totals at check-in. [CLS] [SEP]

updated order totals at check-in can result from changes in products, pricing,
taxes or other fees required by law due to your arrival at a different
participating restaurant than you originally selected. [CLS] [SEP] updated order totals
can also result from the unavailability of certain products, changes in price,
or other reasons. [CLS] [SEP]

### paying for your order. [CLS] [SEP]

you make your purchase when you complete your check in at a restaurant. [CLS] [SEP] when
you complete your check in, you authorize the restaurant to process your order
total (and if updated, your updated order total). [CLS] [SEP] the restaurant’s payment
service provider will process your order total amount (and if updated, your
updated order total amount) to the payment card you selected when you built
your order. [CLS] [SEP] you may receive a notification within the ordering feature that
the restaurant has accepted your order and is preparing it. [CLS] [SEP] you own the
products after you have collected them. [CLS] [SEP]

### cancelling your order, refunds and your consumer rights. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the ability to update or abandon your order at any time until you
check in your order at a restaurant. [CLS] [SEP] however, once you complete your check in
at a restaurant, you cannot cancel it. [CLS] [SEP] if you desire to seek a refund for any
reason, including if the products are unsatisfactory or other reasons, please
contact the restaurant where you purchased the product regarding any refund
due to you. [CLS] [SEP] your legal rights in this respect are not affected by anything in
these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] deals. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the possibility of receiving deals through the online services. [CLS] [SEP] the
following general terms apply to the deals:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] the deal may only be available through that particular online service and for the product shown and subject to availability, in participating restaurants only, and until the expiration date;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] serving times apply (e.g., certain non-breakfast deals may not be available at breakfast serving times);
  3. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise stated each deal expires on redemption;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] only one deal can be used per restaurant visit;
  5. [CLS] [SEP] deals are not transferable; and
  6. [CLS] [SEP] there is no cash alternative. [CLS] [SEP] in addition there may be specific terms that apply to the deal which are stated on the app next to the deal. [CLS] [SEP] not all deals may be combined with orders. [CLS] [SEP]

liable for any direct or indirect lost profits or lost business damage,
special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages, including
lost data, personal injury or property damage related to or arising out of the
online services. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this section is intended to limit mcdonald’s
liability for damages to the extent caused by mcdonald’s own gross negligence
or intentional or unlawful misconduct. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, nothing in this section
is intended to limit or alter your rights as a consumer that cannot be limited
or altered under applicable law**. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s reserves all legal rights to
recover damages or other compensation under these terms or as allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP]

warranties. [CLS] [SEP]

****the online services may include inaccuracies or errors. [CLS] [SEP] **mcdonald’s
provides the online services “as is” and without warranties of any kind either
expressed or implied. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s disclaims all warranties of merchantability
and fitness or a particular purpose. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s does not warrant or make any
representation that the online services will be accurate, reliable,
uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the
online services are free of viruses or other harmful components. [CLS] [SEP] you assume
total responsibility related to your use of the online services. [CLS] [SEP] your sole
remedy against mcdonald’s and all other members of the mcdonald’s system for
dissatisfaction with the online services is to stop using them. [CLS] [SEP] this
limitation of relief is a part of the bargain between the parties. [CLS] [SEP] these
warranty exclusions may not apply to you to the extent that applicable law
does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties.**

### third party services. [CLS] [SEP]

the online services may link to or allow you to use third-party websites,
downloadable materials, content, social networks, or other digital services
(together, “third party services”). [CLS] [SEP] these third parties may have their
separate terms and conditions or privacy policies that you should review and
understand before using them. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s does not endorse and is not
associated with any of these third party services. [CLS] [SEP] **neither mcdonald’s nor
any other members of the mcdonald’s system have any responsibility arising
from or related to these third party services.**

### events beyond our control. [CLS] [SEP] ****

**neither mcdonald’s nor any other members of the mcdonald’s system have any
responsibility for mcdonald’s failure to perform any of its obligations under
these terms cause by or related to any event beyond mcdonald’s reasonable
control.** if such an event occurs, then mcdonald’s obligations under these
terms will be suspended for the duration of the event; and mcdonald’s may, but
is not required to, use reasonable endeavors to find a solution by which its
obligations under these terms may be performed despite the event. [CLS] [SEP]

### ****how we settle disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] any claim or dispute (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have with mcdonald’s or any other members of the mcdonald’s system arising from or related to the online services or these terms will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by jams and conducted before a single arbitrator using jams’s streamlined arbitration rules and procedures (“rules and procedures”);
  2. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the federal arbitration act (“faa”), 9 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] §§ 1-16;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by jams under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and mcdonald’s or other members of the mcdonald’s system;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision shall be based on these terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the online services;
  5. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall apply illinois law consistent with the faa, and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
  6. [CLS] [SEP] no claims shall be arbitrated on a class or representative basis as you and mcdonald’s hereby waive the right to assert claims in any class or representative action; arbitration will therefore only decide the individual claims of you and mcdonald’s; it is agreed that the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of any other person or party to an arbitration between you and mcdonald’s under this provision;
  7. [CLS] [SEP] you and mcdonald's empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable; 
  8. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that the administrative fees, arbitrator fees and filing fees associated with the arbitration exceed $100 usd, mcdonald’s agrees to pay any such administrative, arbitrator and filing fees exceeding $100 on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, mcdonald’s will pay as much of your fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and
  9. [CLS] [SEP] with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. [CLS] [SEP] if, however, subpart (6) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither mcdonald’s nor you shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. [CLS] [SEP] in such event, you agree to bring any and all claims arising out of or related to these terms or the online services in either the state courts of dupage county, illinois or the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. [CLS] [SEP] **further, both you and mcdonald's agree to waive any right to a trial by jury.** finally, this arbitration provision is reciprocally binding on all parties, such that both you and mcdonald’s are required to arbitrate their claims against one another. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on jams and/or jams rules and procedures, you may visit the [jams website](https://www.jamsadr.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#service),
including the licensed application end user terms therein (“apple terms”). [CLS] [SEP] if
you are using the online services through apple application (“apple
application”), you also acknowledge and agree:

  * apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services in relation to the apple application. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any maintenance or support questions in relation to the apple apps, please contact mcdonald’s, not apple, using the above support services details;
  * except as otherwise expressly set out in these terms, any claims relating to the possession or use of the apple application are between you and mcdonald’s (and not between you, or anyone else, and apple); and
  * in the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use (in accordance with these terms) of the apple application infringes any intellectual property rights, apple will not be responsible or liable to you in relation to that claim;

if the apple application that you have purchased does not conform to any
warranty applying to it, you may notify apple, which may refund the purchase
price of the apple application to you subject to then-current apple terms and
conditions. [CLS] [SEP] subject to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, apple
does not give or enter into any warranty, condition or other term in relation
to the apple application and will not be liable to you for any claims, losses,
costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation to the apple application or
as a result of you or anyone else using the apple application or relying on
any of its content. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous. [CLS] [SEP]

  * mcdonald's makes no representation that the online services are appropriate or available outside of the united states. [CLS] [SEP] if you use the online services from other locations you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. [CLS] [SEP]
  * these terms will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of illinois, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * although these terms govern the online services as between mcdonald’s and you only (and neither apple nor any other members of the mcdonald’s system are parties to these terms), apple and all other members of the mcdonald’s system are third party beneficiaries under these terms and will have the right to enforce against you those rights that mcdonald’s holds under these terms to the extent such terms may pertain to them; there are no other third beneficiaries under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the terms are written in english (us). [CLS] [SEP] any translation of the terms into another language is provided solely for your convenience, and to the extent there is any conflict between the two, the english (us) version controls. [CLS] [SEP]
  * on termination of these terms or of your permission to use the online services, all rights granted to you under terms shall cease; however, these terms will continue to apply to your prior use of the online services and anything relating to or arising from such use. [CLS] [SEP] upon termination, all rights of mcdonald’s and other members of the mcdonald’s system, including all intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and licenses in these terms shall survive, as well as all restrictions on use, all limitations on liability and disclaimers, and all of section 9 (“how we settle disputes”)
  * each of the terms and conditions in these terms are severable and operate separately. [CLS] [SEP] if any of them are unlawful, void or unenforceable, then the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if mcdonald’s fails to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if mcdonald’s does not enforce its rights against you, or delays in doing so, that will not mean that mcdonald’s has waived its rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * mcdonald’s may transfer its rights and obligations under these terms to another organization or entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you may only transfer your rights or obligations under these terms to another person if mcdonald’s agrees in writing. [CLS] [SEP]

## mymcdonald’s rewards terms (usa)

**effective** : november 16, 2020

in certain geographical areas, mcdonald’s is piloting its mymcdonald’s rewards
program (“mymcdonald’s rewards”, or the “program”). [CLS] [SEP] if you are within those
geographical areas, the program may be displayed to you. [CLS] [SEP] by using the online
services when the program is displayed, you agree to participate in the
program as part of your use of the online services. [CLS] [SEP]

these mymcdonald’s rewards terms (usa) (the “program terms”) apply only if you

change) the [terms and conditions for mcdonald’s online services
(usa)](/us/en-us/terms-and-conditions.html#online-toc-anchor) (the “online
services terms”). [CLS] [SEP] when the word “terms” is used without any reference to the
“program terms” or the “online services terms,” it is meant to encompass both
sets of terms. [CLS] [SEP] all definitions used in the online services terms apply to
these program terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand and acknowledge that you have already agreed to the online
services terms when you registered and logged into your online services
account. [CLS] [SEP] although the program terms are intended to supplement and not to
change the online services terms, in the event of a conflict between the
program terms and online services terms that relates to the program itself,
the program terms will control. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any other conflict between the
program terms and the online services terms, the online services terms will
control. [CLS] [SEP]

**important** : you understand and acknowledge that the terms contain an
[arbitration agreement](/us/en-us/terms-and-conditions.html#disputes-anchor),
[jury and class action waivers](/us/en-us/terms-and-conditions.html#disputes-
anchor), [limitations on mcdonald’s liability](/us/en-us/terms-and-
conditions.html#limitations-anchor) and other provisions that affect your

the online services. [CLS] [SEP] please carefully read and understand these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### eligibility and enrollment. [CLS] [SEP]

mymcdonald’s rewards is only open to you if you meet the age requirements for
the online services. [CLS] [SEP] in order to enroll in mymcdonald’s rewards, you must
register an online services account. [CLS] [SEP] customers who registered an online
services account prior to the launch of mymcdonald’s rewards can enroll in the
program by using the online services in the geographical area of the program
on or after the launch date of the program. [CLS] [SEP] when you use the online services
outside of the geographical area of the program, neither the program nor any
points you accumulated in the program will be available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### when mccafe® rewards expire. [CLS] [SEP]

if you participated in mccafe® rewards and have an existing mccafe® reward on
or before december 27, 2020, then you can redeem that reward on or before
february 25, 2021. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to not immediately enroll in mymcdonald’s
rewards and you receive a mccafe® reward on or after december 28, 2020, you
will have sixty (60) days from the date that the mccafe® reward was received
to redeem that reward. [CLS] [SEP] after that sixty (60) day period, any existing mccafe®
reward will expire. [CLS] [SEP]

### when existing purchases towards mccafe® rewards are converted to points. [CLS] [SEP]

if you participated in mccafe® rewards and have made purchases as part of
mccafe® rewards, but have not made enough purchases to receive a mccafe®
reward, then if you choose to enroll in mymcdonald’s rewards, your existing
purchases qualifying towards a mccafe® reward will immediately be converted
into mymcdonald’s rewards points (“points”). [CLS] [SEP] for each purchase (up to 4
qualifying purchases) under mccafe® rewards, 400 points will be deposited in
your account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have opted into receiving emails from mcdonald’s, you
will receive an email alerting you of the number of points added to your
account. [CLS] [SEP] we will send the email to your email address that you used to create
your online services account. [CLS] [SEP]

### how to earn points. [CLS] [SEP]

once enrolled in the program, when you identify your online services account
at the time of purchase, you will earn 100 points for every $1 u.s dollar
spent on qualifying purchases. [CLS] [SEP] you can identify your online services account
at the time of purchase by any way that we recognize, such as: (a) making a
purchase using the mobile order & pay feature of the mobile app, (b) scanning
a qr code at a register or kiosk, or (c) giving the code displayed in your
account to the restaurant crew person who is taking your order. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t
properly identify your online services account before you complete your
qualifying purchase, you cannot earn any points for that purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

### qualifying purchases. [CLS] [SEP]

a “qualifying purchase” means using the online services to purchase eligible
products from a participating restaurant in a manner that properly identifies
you as described above. [CLS] [SEP] qualifying purchases where an active reward, mobile
offer, or promotional offer is redeemed will accrue points, but you will only
accrue points for u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars actually spent in the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] further, the
following are not considered qualifying purchases and will not accrue points:
(a) taxes, bag and bottle fees, and other surcharges or fees, and (b) loading
any money on a mcdonald’s arch card (gift card), but when a mcdonald’s arch
card is used to make a qualifying purchase you will accrue points. [CLS] [SEP]

### verifying your points balance. [CLS] [SEP]

you can check your points balance in your online services account using the
mcdonald’s app. [CLS] [SEP] points that you earn may not always immediately post to your
account. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible to ensure points from your qualifying purchases
are correct. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe points from your qualifying purchase were
incorrectly calculated, you must notify mcdonald’s within six (6) months of
the qualifying purchase by providing your receipt to mcdonald’s customer care. [CLS] [SEP]
mcdonald’s has the sole discretion to determine points in your account and
mcdonald’s has no liability for any delay or failure to correctly credit
points to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### exchanging your points for rewards that you choose. [CLS] [SEP]

you can exchange your points for rewards for free products on the rewards menu
(each a “reward”), which you can then use at participating restaurants. [CLS] [SEP] you
must use the mcdonald’s app or other online services in order to exchange your
points for rewards. [CLS] [SEP] if you have enough points for a reward, the reward will be
unlocked in the online services and available for a points exchange. [CLS] [SEP] potential
rewards for which you don’t have enough points may be displayed but locked. [CLS] [SEP]
once you select a reward and exchange your points for it, the number of points
for that reward will be temporarily deducted from your account and the reward
will be displayed in your account. [CLS] [SEP] the reward will temporarily remain in your
account until you redeem it for a product, and if you do not, it will be
converted back to points. [CLS] [SEP] when you redeem the reward for which you exchanged
points, the points will be permanently deducted from your account. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot
exchange points for more than one reward at a time. [CLS] [SEP] when you redeem your
reward for a product, you are obtaining that product directly from the
participating restaurant, not from other members of the mcdonald’s system. [CLS] [SEP]

### other ways to earn and redeem. [CLS] [SEP]

from time to time, mcdonald’s may offer new and different ways for you to earn
and redeem points, including bonus campaigns or points accelerators. [CLS] [SEP]
mcdonald’s has the sole discretion to offer, change and terminate the
different ways to earn and redeem points, including for example, the points
associated with bonus campaigns and accelerators. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes earning and
redeeming points may be subject to additional terms (“additional terms”)
disclosed at the time of the offer. [CLS] [SEP]

### rewards menu. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald’s publishes eligible rewards in the online services and identifies
how many points are required for each reward. [CLS] [SEP] the rewards menu may have
multiple reward levels and multiple rewards on each level, which can change
from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s makes no promise of the continued availability
of any reward, even if it is displayed to you in the online services. [CLS] [SEP] rewards
are available until supplies last at participating restaurants and may be
modified, changed and discontinued at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

### point expiration. [CLS] [SEP]

points expire on the first (1st) day of the month after the sixth (6th) month
from the date such points were earned. [CLS] [SEP] points will be maintained in your
online services account until you exchange your points for a reward, or until
they expire, whichever occurs first. [CLS] [SEP] if mcdonald’s terminates the program, any
unused points in your account will expire and be void when the program is
terminated. [CLS] [SEP] upon termination of your online services account for any reason
(including, but not limited to, whether you choose to close your account or
mcdonald’s terminates your account for a violation of these terms), all points
that you have accumulated in mymcdonald’s rewards will immediately expire. [CLS] [SEP]

### your compliance with the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald’s has the discretion to invalidate or void points from your online
services account, or to suspend or terminate your account (both now and in the
future), if mcdonald’s believes you improperly obtained points, abused the
program or otherwise violated these terms. [CLS] [SEP] in that event, you forfeit any
points you have accumulated (including properly obtained points) and you
forfeit your right to earn points in the future. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s has the sole
discretion to determine your compliance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s
determination is final. [CLS] [SEP]

### no rights in points. [CLS] [SEP]

points are not property and you have no vested right or interest in points. [CLS] [SEP]
points have no cash value. [CLS] [SEP] points are not assignable or transferrable between
online services accounts or otherwise, and points cannot be combined across
accounts, regardless of who registered the account. [CLS] [SEP]

### changes to mymcdonald’s rewards. [CLS] [SEP]

mymcdonald’s rewards can change from time to time, so be sure to continue to
refer to these terms for the latest details and news. [CLS] [SEP] we are also constantly
improving the program and we may have exciting new offers. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald’s reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, change,
modify or discontinue mymcdonald’s rewards, in whole or in part, including any
terms, rules, features, benefits, rewards, conditions of participation, points
accruing or accumulation ratio, the points redemption policy, the points
expiration policy, or any other aspect of the program at any time, with or
without advance notice, even though changes may affect points and rewards
already in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

mcdonald’s may make changes to any element of the program to correct for
typographical, printing or other errors and you waive any rights relating to
same. [CLS] [SEP] any changes will become effective immediately upon posting the
revisions. [CLS] [SEP] at all times, you are solely responsible for remaining
knowledgeable about and in compliance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### miscellaneous. [CLS] [SEP]

all rewards offered via the program are subject to availability. [CLS] [SEP] some
participating restaurants do not sell all products offered as rewards. [CLS] [SEP] images
of products and packaging of rewards are examples only and may not be
identical to the product or packaging you receive from a participating
restaurant. [CLS] [SEP]
