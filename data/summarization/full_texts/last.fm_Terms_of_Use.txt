#  terms of use

**updated on:** tuesday 2 june 2015

  * like most large-scale websites, we have some rules which you need to stick to when you use last.fm. [CLS] [SEP] these rules aren’t just the “blahblahblah-yawn-small print” – these are the legal terms of use and so we recommend you read them carefully so you know what you’ve agreed to. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as with all websites, last.fm, its services and software will change over time, both in terms of the content displayed and the functionality offered. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to make those changes, and to change these terms in line with them. [CLS] [SEP] software made available for download by last.fm remains the property of last.fm, and we reserve the right to update and change that too. [CLS] [SEP]
  * please don’t reproduce any part of the website or content without our permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * a lot of information and content on last.fm is provided by third parties – both users and other third parties – and the accuracy and reliability of that information is entirely the responsibility of those parties. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, you may sometimes find links on last.fm to other websites; last.fm cannot be held responsible for the content of those sites. [CLS] [SEP] links, like everything else added by members of the last.fm community, are entirely the responsibility of the individuals who have added them. [CLS] [SEP]
  * by using last.fm, you also agree to our privacy policy - please read our [privacy policy](/legal/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you’ve found content on the website that you own and that you believe is being used without your permission then please read section 10 of these terms of use for a detailed description of what to do about it. [CLS] [SEP] we take infringement claims very seriously, so provide all the information set out in section 10 and we will act swiftly to deal with any claims. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we have a detailed acceptable use policy, but much like the [community guidelines](/help/guidelines) they boil down into a few fairly simple concepts: play nicely, respect other members of the community and use common sense. [CLS] [SEP] if we believe someone isn’t playing fairly and within the spirit of the guidelines then we’re entitled to ban that user at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t like doing it, but sometimes it’s the most appropriate response. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you enter a competition or use software alongside last.fm then make sure you read any accompanying terms and conditions carefully too, because they may have conditions in addition to this document. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you use last.fm and all of its software and services, you accept it “as is”. [CLS] [SEP] like human beings, we have the odd fault or two and we’re constantly updating and improving every aspect of last.fm, ironing out new-found bugs and making subtle changes to things like our recommendation algorithms. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, last.fm should never be considered a “finished product”, and by using last.fm you accept it – warts and all. [CLS] [SEP]
  * last.fm is based in london – we quite like it here – and this document is to be interpreted in line with the laws governing england and wales. [CLS] [SEP]
