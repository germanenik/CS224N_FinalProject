time. [CLS] [SEP] any questions you have posted may remain on the quora platform and be
edited by other users. [CLS] [SEP] any deleted content will be removed from third-party
sites from which it has been shared via quora’s standard sharing features;
however we have no control over deletions or changes to your content if it has
been shared manually by others. [CLS] [SEP] when you make edits to your content, other
users will be able to see the history of those edits in your profile activity
and on content edit logs. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _adult content_**. [CLS] [SEP] in your profile’s privacy settings, you can elect
whether to receive adult content. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _emails and notifications_** **.** when you join the quora platform by

notifications about recommendations or other information we think may interest
you, we may still send you transactional emails about your account or any
services you have requested or received from us. [CLS] [SEP]

third parties may comment on your postings within the quora platform. [CLS] [SEP] in your

for a period of time even after you have turned off indexing, as implementing
this change is outside of our control. [CLS] [SEP]

 ** _deleted or deactivated account_**. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose “delete account” in your
profile’s “privacy settings,” then all of your content will be removed from
public visibility on the quora platform, and it may not be restored by us,
even if you change your mind. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose “deactivate account,” then you
will no longer receive any communications from us, and users will not be able
to interact with you; however your content will remain on the quora platform. [CLS] [SEP]
once you deactivate your account, you can reactivate it any time by choosing
to log in. [CLS] [SEP]
