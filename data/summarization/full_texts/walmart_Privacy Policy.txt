## walmart privacy policy summary

_at walmart, our customers are number one - always. [CLS] [SEP] that's why everything we
do is focused on providing excellent customer service and delivering low
prices._

the information you share with walmart allows us to provide the products and
services you need and want while giving you the very best shopping experience. [CLS] [SEP]

our founder sam walton reminded us that "a promise we make is a promise we
keep," and it's our promise to customers that we respect the trust you place
in us and the privacy of the information you share. [CLS] [SEP] part of providing superior
customer service includes making sure that we're building a relationship of
trust with customers. [CLS] [SEP] our way of doing that is to let you know in a clear,
prominent, and easily accessible way how we collect, use, share, and above all
protect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

our policy outlines:

  * how and why we collect your personal information;
  * how your personal information is used and protected;
  * when and with whom we share your personal information; and
  * what choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

 **[walmart privacy policy frequently asked questions
>](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/walmart-privacy-
policy/walmart-privacy-policy-frequently-asked-questions "link:
http://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/walmart-privacy-policy/walmart-
privacy-policy-frequently-asked-questions")**  

## what does this privacy policy include?

this policy covers how and why we collect, use, share, and protect your
personal information:  

  * within our walmart and amigo retail stores in the united states and puerto rico, and 
  * on our websites and mobile services where this policy is posted. [CLS] [SEP]

personal information is information that identifies you or reasonably can be
linked to information that identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you place an item
on layaway or place an order online, we collect personal information, such as
name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information. [CLS] [SEP]

we have [specific privacy notices](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-
security/notices/) that explain the information practices that apply to our
specialized operations. [CLS] [SEP] see _“what are your privacy protections for specific
types of personal information?”_ section for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

## what privacy protections apply to specific types of personal information?

our specific privacy notices for our specialized operations include:  

  * our health services operations, such as walmart pharmacies, vision center, and clinics, use patient health information as described in the health services [notice of privacy practices](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/). [CLS] [SEP] review the [notice of privacy practices](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/) for the information practices specific to patient health information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * walmart makes a variety of financial products and services available to you, either directly or in connection with business partners. [CLS] [SEP] a description of information practices specific to financial products and services is available [here](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/#financial-services). [CLS] [SEP] 
  * walmart maintains separate privacy policies applicable to its international operations. [CLS] [SEP]

## what is our pledge of accountability?

we require our associates, business partners, and service providers to manage
your personal information properly. [CLS] [SEP]

we have designated a team of trained associates who are responsible for
helping to ensure compliance with this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we require all those who manage
customers’ personal information to do so properly and in accordance with our
policies. [CLS] [SEP]

## what type of information do we collect and how do we collect it?

we collect information to deliver the products and services you request, to
help improve your shopping experience, and to support our business functions. [CLS] [SEP]
we collect information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with
our stores, websites, and mobile services. [CLS] [SEP]

**what information do we collect**  
we may collect the following categories of personal information. [CLS] [SEP] not all
categories may be collected about every individual:

  * personal identifiers, such as name and address
  * device and online identifiers and related information, such as telephone number and email address
  * internet, application, and network activity, such as cookie ids and browser visits
  * government identifiers, such as national identification numbers and driver’s license numbers
  * demographic information, such as age and date of birth
  * financial information, such as credit and debit card numbers and claims information 
  * health and health insurance information, such as prescription numbers and health insurance identification numbers
  * characteristics of protected classifications under state or federal law, such as gender and nationality
  * purchase history information, such as products you have bought, rented, and returned
  * biometric information, such as imagery of the iris, retina, and fingerprints
  * location information, such as geo-location information

  * employment information, such as occupation, title, licenses and professional memberships
  * background and criminal information, such as background checks and criminal convictions
  * education information, such as degree and schooling information
  * individual preferences and characteristics, such as inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors

 **how do we collect information**  
we collect information from you in a variety of ways. [CLS] [SEP] it may be:

  * provided directly by you or a member of your household
  * collected from a device associated with you or your household
  * collected through in-store technology
  * collected from another company within our family of companies
  * collected from an external third-party source

our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to
support our business. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information provided directly by you or a member of your household**  
you actively share information with us in various ways in our stores and
online. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you share information when you:

  * make an in-store or online purchase, or other transaction, with us;
  * create an account on one of our websites or mobile services;
  * use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list;
  * participate in our programs, such as ereceipts;
  * conduct a transaction or request a service where we collect information (including when required by law, such as hunting and fishing licenses);
  * request customer service or contact us;
  * post a review or comment on one of our social media pages, or post a rating, review or other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services; 
  * participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey; or
  * use features of our websites and mobile services that may ask you to grant us access to the camera or microphone on your computer or mobile device (such as voice search or scanning bar codes). [CLS] [SEP]

when you engage in these activities, you may share different types of personal
information with us, such as your name, email address, physical or postal
address, phone number, date of birth, and payment information. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information collected from a device associated with you or your household**  
you also passively provide us information in other ways through technology. [CLS] [SEP]
some of this information may be linked to you personally. [CLS] [SEP] this information
helps our websites and mobile services work correctly and supports our
customer marketing and analytics efforts – our work to understand our
customers’ needs and provide information about our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] here
are some examples:

  *  **device information** : we collect technical information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services. [CLS] [SEP] this includes information such as internet protocol (ip) address, the type of mobile device you use, your device operating system and browser type, a unique device identifier, the address of referring websites, the path you take through our websites, and other information about your session on our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **browsing information** : we use our own and third-party technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and mobile device identifiers to collect information about the use of our websites and mobile services. [CLS] [SEP] we use these tools to provide an integrated and more personalized shopping experience for you. [CLS] [SEP] for example: cookies allow us to provide you relevant information as you use or return to our sites; web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was opened, or if ad banners on our websites and other sites were effective. [CLS] [SEP] under certain circumstances, we permit third parties to collect information on our websites for their own business purposes using cookies, web beacons, iframes and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] __
  * **precise device location information** : we may collect information about your location when your device is set to provide location information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your device’s gps signal allows us to show you the nearest walmart stores. [CLS] [SEP] other examples include allowing us to know when you are about to arrive to pick up your online grocery pickup order after you check in. [CLS] [SEP] we may be able to recognize the location of a mobile device in stores where we provide customers free wifi access or through the use of bluetooth technology. [CLS] [SEP] through mobile services, bluetooth technology in our stores allows us to show you nearby products that may interest you, making it easier for you to locate products within and navigate through the store. [CLS] [SEP] _see “what are your choices?” below for more information._

 **information we collect through in-store technology**  
we may collect your personal information from technology we use in our stores,
such as our facility cameras. [CLS] [SEP] we operate cameras in store for security and
operational purposes, for example, to help us improve the design of our stores
to better serve our customers. [CLS] [SEP]

**information we collect from another company within our family of companies**  
we may collect your personal information from another organization within our
corporate family of companies, such as with sam's club and moosejaw.com. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information we collect from external third-party sources**  
we receive information about you from other sources to help us correct or
supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services
and marketing to you, and prevent or detect fraud. [CLS] [SEP] we collect personal
information from consumer reporting agencies in conjunction with products or
services that involve financial risk to walmart, such as transactions in which
walmart extends you financing. [CLS] [SEP]

## how do we use your personal information?

we use your personal information to provide you products and services, such as
to fulfill your requests for products or to help us personalize our services
and marketing to you. [CLS] [SEP] we also use your personal information to support our
business functions, such as fraud prevention, marketing, and legal functions. [CLS] [SEP]

some examples include:

  * to fulfill your order or requests for services and provide customer service
  * to create and maintain your account
  * to conduct auditing and monitoring of transactions and engagement
  * to conduct marketing, personalization, and third-party advertising
  * to protect the security and integrity of our websites, mobile services and our business, and help prevent fraud 
  * to update our operational and technical functionality
  * to conduct business analysis, such as analytics, projections, identifying areas for operational improvement
  * to conduct research and development
  * to fulfill our legal function or obligations

to do the above, we combine personal and non-personal information, collected
online and offline, including information from third party sources. [CLS] [SEP] we also
may transfer or share your personal information within our corporate family of
companies, such as with sam's club, moosejaw.com or hayneedle.com, for these
purposes, as permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

uses of personal information relevant to our specialized operations, such as
our health services and financial services lines of business, are described in
our [notices for specific types of
information](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/). [CLS] [SEP]

## how do we share your personal information outside of walmart?

all of the categories of personal information that we collect have been shared
with other companies, including those within our corporate family, for a
business purpose. [CLS] [SEP] we will not sell or rent your personal information for
money. [CLS] [SEP] we may share your personal information in limited circumstances, such
as to conduct our business, for other companies to offer you and administer
your use of co-branded products, in the event all or a part of our business is
merged, sold or reorganized, when legally required, as described below, or
with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not share your personal information outside of our corporate family of
companies, except in the following circumstances:

 **service providers**  
we share personal information about you with service providers that help with
our business activities, including shipping vendors, billing and refund
vendors, payment card processors, marketing and advertising vendors, and
companies that help us improve our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we require our
service providers to keep your personal information secure. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow
our service providers to use or share your personal information for any
purpose other than providing services on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] your personal information
may be stored and processed by our service providers in the united states or
other locations where the service providers or walmart maintain facilities. [CLS] [SEP]

 **products and services offered by other businesses**  
we will sometimes enable other businesses to make their products or services
available to our customers, such as through walmart.com marketplace retailers. [CLS] [SEP]
you may purchase products or services from these other businesses at our
stores or through our websites or mobile services. [CLS] [SEP] when you purchase these
products or services, we identify the other business and share with this
business personal information related to your purchase of their products and
services. [CLS] [SEP]

**co-branded products and services**  
we may share your personal information with companies that offer co-branded
products or services, such as our co-branded walmart credit card. [CLS] [SEP] in
conjunction with the co-branding program, we may receive compensation from the
co-branding activity. [CLS] [SEP] these companies are prohibited from using your personal
information for purposes other than offering you, and administering your use
of, these co-branded products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **legal requirements and protection of our company and others**  
we may share your personal information in other special circumstances, which
include situations when sharing is required by law, or we believe sharing will
help to protect the safety, property, or rights of walmart, our customers, our
associates, or other persons. [CLS] [SEP] examples include:

  * protecting the health or safety of customers;
  * addressing crimes committed on walmart property;
  * identifying and addressing fraud or financial risk;
  * providing personal information from cameras to law enforcement at their written request;
  * responding to a search warrant or other valid legal inquiry; and 
  * responding to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or violation of law. [CLS] [SEP]

 **business transfers**  
in the event that all or a part of our business is merged, sold or reorganized
(including transfers made as a part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings),
personal information about you could be shared with the successor business. [CLS] [SEP] we
will use reasonable measures to help ensure that any successor treats your
information in accordance with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

 **pursuant to our specific privacy notices**  
we have [specific privacy notices](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-
security/notices/) related to some of our specialized operations. [CLS] [SEP] we may
disclose personal information for purposes identified in those notices, which
arise in those specialized operational areas. [CLS] [SEP] these specific privacy notices
describe additional or different information practices relevant to those
operations. [CLS] [SEP] our specific privacy notices can be found
[here](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/). [CLS] [SEP] for example,
as detailed in the [notice of privacy
practices](https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/), our
health services operations will disclose personal information to other health
care providers for treatment purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

 **advertising related activities**  
we may share aggregated or pseudonymous information (pseudonymous information
includes things like: device identifier, type of device, ip addresses, cookies
and other information associated with your browsing and app usage) with other
companies, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics providers,
and others. [CLS] [SEP] we do not share information that directly identifies you
(information such as name or email address) with these companies. [CLS] [SEP]

we also allow companies that show advertisements on our webpages or our apps
to collect information from your browsers or devices via the use of cookies or
other technologies. [CLS] [SEP] other companies' use of cookies and other data collection
technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. [CLS] [SEP] like
many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners. [CLS] [SEP] however,
these parties are not authorized to access information from walmart cookies. [CLS] [SEP]
for more information about your choices related to advertising activities see
_“what are your choices?”_

 **with your consent**  
in circumstances other than those described above, we will ask for your
affirmative consent before we share your personal information outside of our

device communicates this location information. [CLS] [SEP] we may also offer additional
controls on our use of your mobile location information. [CLS] [SEP]

we want to offer you choices about the different ways we collect, use, or
share your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] these choices are described below. [CLS] [SEP]

 **marketing preferences**  
when we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following
standards:

  * we use an opt-in standard for automated phone and text messages, and for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing of their products, such as sending you promotions for their products. [CLS] [SEP] opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * we use an opt-out standard for email, app notifications, and postal mail. [CLS] [SEP] opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below). [CLS] [SEP] 

additionally, these standards may not apply to walmart-branded credit card
offerings because these are provided through associated financial
institutions. [CLS] [SEP] however, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened
offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting
agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official consumer
credit reporting industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to
[www.optoutprescreen.com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t "link:
https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t"). [CLS] [SEP]

if you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name,
the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your
related contact information. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, if you would like to opt-out of
mail, include your mailing address. [CLS] [SEP] please allow sufficient time for your
marketing preferences to be processed. [CLS] [SEP] it may take up to ten days to process
your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests
related to telephone calls, text messages, app notification and sharing
information with your consent. [CLS] [SEP] please note that postal mailings are often
prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six
to ten weeks. [CLS] [SEP]

since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties, such as catalog
opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one
of the mechanisms mentioned above. [CLS] [SEP]

please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications
from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service
or reminder notices, or recalls. [CLS] [SEP] we may also need to contact you with
questions or information regarding your order. [CLS] [SEP]

**interest-based advertising preferences**  
we personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you
advertisements that are tailored to your interests. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you browse
or shop for electronics with us or on other sites, we may show you ads for
electronics as you continue to browse the internet. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about
browsing information see _“information we receive from you.”_

we show you advertisements related to walmart or our advertising partners. [CLS] [SEP] we
belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating
websites and mobile services to show you interest-based advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] you
may also see ads for walmart on participating websites and mobile services
based on how you browse. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about interest-based

whether your device communicates this information. [CLS] [SEP] you will also need to
adjust your device’s bluetooth settings to completely disable the collection
of bluetooth location-related data. [CLS] [SEP] see your device instructions to learn more
about these settings. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may offer you controls on our use of
your mobile location information. [CLS] [SEP] _see “what types of information do we
collect?”_ above for more information on the types of location information we
collect. [CLS] [SEP]

**device camera and microphone**  
some of the features on our websites and mobile services may require access to
the camera or microphone of your computer or mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you must give your
permission before we access your device’s camera or microphone, and you can
adjust the settings of your device at any time to control access to your
camera or microphone. [CLS] [SEP] _see “what types of information do we collect?”_ above
for more information. [CLS] [SEP]
