blizzard entertainment and its subsidiaries (collectively "blizzard") respects
the privacy of its players and online visitors; and recognizes the importance
of providing a secure environment for them. [CLS] [SEP] we have adopted a company-wide
online privacy policy (“privacy policy”) that explains how we collect, store,
and use the information you provide us. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy details how
blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to
information that may be collected by blizzard offline, including but not
limited to employment related interactions. [CLS] [SEP] when you click a link to other
sites from a blizzard website, this privacy policy does not apply to, and
cannot control the activities on, those other sites. [CLS] [SEP] we highly recommend that
you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to
before providing any personally identifiable information. [CLS] [SEP]

the personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and
processed within the united states or other countries where blizzard maintains
facilities or business operations. [CLS] [SEP]

by using this website and/or any of blizzard’s online products or services,
you acknowledge the terms of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you object to anything
described in this privacy policy, please do not use our websites or play our
games. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check back
periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. [CLS] [SEP] if we make a
material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you by posting the
change on our websites or in this privacy policy and, if necessary, give you
additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective. [CLS] [SEP]
your continued use of the blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of
these changes. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that
blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of
the [entertainment software rating board’s privacy certified
program](https://www.esrb.org/privacy/) (“esrb privacy certified”). [CLS] [SEP] esrb
privacy certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use
and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] to protect your
privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of
our websites where this privacy policy is posted have been reviewed and
certified by esrb privacy certified to meet established online information
collection, use and disclosure practices. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] what personal information is collected and how do we use it?

**information collected from you.** if an online visitor submits information
to blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or
services though our online platforms, (2) product or account registration, or
registration for online game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4)
message boards or forums, (5) ecards or recruit-a-friend e-mails, (6) warranty
registrations, (7) contest registrations, (8) the playing of a game or use of
a service, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical support, (11) share
wish list feature, and/or (12) newsletters. [CLS] [SEP] personal information collected may
include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will
not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require
registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information
is provided. [CLS] [SEP]

visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional
information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping
and billing addresses. [CLS] [SEP]

for some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or
to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not
limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform
preferences; and, we may combine such information with other personal and/or
non-personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

in specific cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or
government-issued id to verify your identity, location, and/or account
ownership. [CLS] [SEP] when photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted
as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the
case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required
to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights. [CLS] [SEP]

from time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain
personally identifiable information on blizzard’s websites. [CLS] [SEP] however, we will
obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication
in accordance with the applicable blizzard agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be
considered private. [CLS] [SEP] blizzard may monitor and/or record your communications
(including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or
service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud, or for
enforcement of blizzard’s end user license agreement (eula) and/or terms of
use. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby provide your irrevocable, express consent to such monitoring
and recording. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of
privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or
communications, including without limitation chat text or voice
communications. [CLS] [SEP] because voice chat and other communications may be viewed
and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally
identifiable information in those communications. [CLS] [SEP]

**information collected automatically.** in addition, your web browser or
client software may transmit certain geographic information or information
regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to
blizzard. [CLS] [SEP] blizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics
about our user community. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, blizzard may use such information for
security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or
enforcement purposes. [CLS] [SEP] blizzard may also collect ip information, which it may
use to infer your approximate location. [CLS] [SEP]

**information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and
business partners).** blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information
collected at a blizzard website with data from third parties in order to
update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our
products, services, or systems. [CLS] [SEP] if you register an account using your facebook
credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and
last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your
friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP] similar
data exchanges will occur when you link your blizzard account with other
companies, such as twitch and console platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

**how we use your information.** the personal information you provide
blizzard, and that blizzard collects automatically, will allow us to provide
our games and services, fulfill your product or service order; alert you of
new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your
customer service or technical support questions or issues; to send ecards or
“recruit-a-friend” emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities,
contests, promotions, or special events and offers. [CLS] [SEP] we also use this
information to secure our services and users, to prevent cheating and fraud,
to monitor for toxicity, and to enforce our agreements with you. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be
considered private. [CLS] [SEP] by using the speech to text feature in voice chat, you
understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to
text, including for accessibility purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we do not retain the chat
transcription after you end the session and close the chat window. [CLS] [SEP] however, by
using voice or text chat, you understand that your communications may be
monitored and/or recorded for accessibility, toxicity analysis (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] toxic
player behavior), to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of
blizzard’s end user license agreement (eula) and/or terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the
transmission of any user generated content or communications, including
without limitation chat text, voice communications, or speech to text for
transcription purposes. [CLS] [SEP] because voice chat and other communications may be
viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any
personally identifiable information in those communications. [CLS] [SEP]

last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or
demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better
suit your needs. [CLS] [SEP] we do this to better understand and serve our customers. [CLS] [SEP]

personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business
capacity is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices
stated in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] this includes employees and former employees. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] what type of communications may you receive?

### offers

we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special
deals, and promotions. [CLS] [SEP] out of respect for your privacy, we present the option
not to receive these communications. [CLS] [SEP] please see the “choice” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

### service-related announcements

we will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when
it is necessary to do so. [CLS] [SEP] you will also receive communication regarding your
account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related
to changes and suspicious login activity on your account. [CLS] [SEP] generally, you may
not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. [CLS] [SEP]

### game-related announcements

we may send you information related to the game(s) you play. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we
may congratulate you on your recent success. [CLS] [SEP]

### customer service

based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will
send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. [CLS] [SEP] we will also
communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services
you request, and to manage your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### recruit a friend/e-cards/share wish list

if you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, share wish list, or e-card
features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. [CLS] [SEP] we will
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit
the website. [CLS] [SEP] blizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to
send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] who is collecting your information?

when you are asked for information while on a blizzard website or in a
blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to blizzard
entertainment, inc. [CLS] [SEP] and its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise
in that location or in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

occasionally, blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process
personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]
in these instances, blizzard controls the use of your data via written
contracts which conform to this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, some services are provided with partner companies. [CLS] [SEP] for instance,
if you purchase something from blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via
fedex, your information will be collected by fedex. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want your
information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by
not using that service or by not providing any information. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware
that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we
provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same
privacy and security procedures as blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to
assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal
information. [CLS] [SEP]

our websites may include certain social media features such as the facebook
"like" button, and widgets such as the share this button or interactive mini-
programs that run on our websites. [CLS] [SEP] these features may collect your internet
protocol (“ip”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may
set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. [CLS] [SEP] social media features
and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of
the company providing it. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] with whom may your personal information be shared?

blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the
ways that are described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public
information with third parties. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we share unique identifiers
specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and
improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the
purposes described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you purchase a product or
license a game from another company on our battle.net platform, we may share
some of your account information with that company so they may establish a
direct relationship with you. [CLS] [SEP] because of that sharing, you may receive
communications from that company. [CLS] [SEP]

we share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who
create applications and websites that benefit our player community. [CLS] [SEP] you may
opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of
game-data sharing in the privacy section of battle.net account management. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to disclose your information if we are required to do so
by law. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil
litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal
obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the
eula). [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your information with vendors blizzard engages to perform
services for blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event
ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer
services support, information technology hardware and software). [CLS] [SEP] in these
situations, a written contract between blizzard and the vendor shall control
such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security
regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data
except as required for the performance of those services for blizzard. [CLS] [SEP] if your
data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

as with any business, your personal information is also an asset of blizzard
and will become part of our normal business records. [CLS] [SEP] as such, we may also
disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a
line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service
and information in connection with that line of business with as little
disruption as possible. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition,
reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information
may be transferred to blizzard's successor or assign. [CLS] [SEP]

blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users
can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. [CLS] [SEP] when posting to a message
board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available
online and the user does so at his or her own risk. [CLS] [SEP] for certain forums, anyone
posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their real id -- that is,
their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of
their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding real id below). [CLS] [SEP] if
your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may
contact us at [dataprivacy@blizzard.com](mailto:dataprivacy@blizzard.com) to
request removal. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal
information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] what choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and
distribution of your personal information?

you have choices over the information provided by you and by other sources,
and how blizzard uses that information. [CLS] [SEP] you can exercise your choices by
updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in
your battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

### your choices about information provided by you

if you do not want to provide blizzard with personal information, then you can
choose not to provide it. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose not to provide us with personal
information, we may not always be able to provide you with the blizzard
product or service you want. [CLS] [SEP] for example, without providing an email address,
you cannot create a battle.net account. [CLS] [SEP]

### your choices about information provided by third parties

you may control how third parties collect and share your information by
changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] before disclosing information to third parties, we recommend
you check their respective privacy policies for further details. [CLS] [SEP]

### your choices about blizzard using your information

you can exercise choices over how blizzard uses your personal information and
update your preferences at any time:

• to remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters
from blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your
battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences. [CLS] [SEP] you will
need your password to access your account;

• to disable selected cookies from collecting information relating to the
effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you
with personalized advertising, please see our [cookie
policy](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/cookies); and

• to remove having your game-data available to our community of application
developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the privacy section of battle.net
account management. [CLS] [SEP]

if you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please
note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account,
such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service
related information. [CLS] [SEP]

**right to data portability:**  
data portability is the ability to move data from one company to another (for
instance, when you transfer your mobile phone service to another carrier). [CLS] [SEP]
while this right is not very applicable to blizzard’s current business, we
will provide you with an electronic file with your most basic account

information necessary to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from
fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing
functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech

in our response. [CLS] [SEP]

**right to opt-out:**  
california residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information,
as defined by the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] this does not include when:

• you direct us to disclose your personal information or use us to interact
with a third party and the third party does not sell the personal information;  
• we use or share an identifier solely to alert a third party you have opted
out of the sale of your personal information;  
• your personal information is transferred as an asset as part of a
transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of our
business, in which case the third party would have to tell you in writing if
it materially changes how the information is used or shared; and  
• we use or share your personal information under a written contract with a
service provider necessary to perform a business purpose. [CLS] [SEP] here, the service
the service provider performs is on our behalf, and our written contract
prohibits it from keeping, using or disclosing your personal information for
any purpose other than for the specific purpose identified in the contract. [CLS] [SEP]

in these cases, the disclosure of your personal information would not be
considered a “sale” under ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] we use and share your information as described
in this privacy policy and do not believe this use and sharing is a sale as
defined by the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] we have not sold personal information about you in the

behalf, please be sure the agent can (i) demonstrate you have provided written
permission for the agent to submit the request on your behalf, and (ii)

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] how secure is your personal information?

blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal
information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature,
for example, publicly-available information like user generated content,
leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] we also take steps to
ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and
alteration. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we request vendors who process personal information
on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help
protect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] however, the internet by its nature is not
a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving,
as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to
management of those risks. [CLS] [SEP] the complete security of any personal information
collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed. [CLS] [SEP]

it is very important for you to understand that you control the security of
your account to a great extent. [CLS] [SEP] choosing a password you don’t use on any other
system is important. [CLS] [SEP] changing that password occasionally is also a good idea. [CLS] [SEP]
another way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free
blizzard authenticator app to your phone; just go to the app store for your
phone and download it at no cost to you. [CLS] [SEP]
