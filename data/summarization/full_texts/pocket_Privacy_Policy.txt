# privacy policy

#####  _posted february 16, 2021_

this notice describes the privacy policy that applies to all information
collected or submitted when you install or use the pocket application or any
of the other proprietary software applications or services we provide, and
when you visit our website (all of which are referred to collectively herein
as the "pocket technologies"). [CLS] [SEP] the pocket technologies are owned and licensed
by mozilla corporation (referred to herein as "we," "us," "our," "mozilla"),
and are operated by mozilla's business unit known as "pocket," which has
developed applications and services for use in connection with a variety of
devices and platforms, including without limitation, windows, mac, iphone,
ipad, kindle fire, android, blackberry, windows phone, chrome, safari, firefox
and other mobile devices and computers. [CLS] [SEP]

we understand your concerns about privacy. [CLS] [SEP] we want you to understand what
types of information we collect and what may happen to that information if you
install the pocket application, visit the pocket website or use any of the
pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

our privacy policy includes the following provisions, and you can jump to each
by selecting the links below:

  * user accounts and collection of information
  * collection of information as part of using pocket service
  * use of cookies and analytics
  * use of information
  * sharing of information
  * keeping information
  * transfer of information
  * security
  * phishing
  * managing my privacy and email settings
  * amendments to policy

##### user accounts and collection of information

you are not required to create a user account or provide any personal
information in order to visit the pocket website. [CLS] [SEP] you are required to create a
user account, however, to use our application. [CLS] [SEP] during registration, you are
required to provide a name, password and valid email address. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to share any articles, videos, or other content with another
person, we will ask you to provide a valid email address for that person. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also ask you to provide your username and password for third party
websites in order to access the articles and information published on such
sites. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information if you contact us for support or help,
submit an application or otherwise communicate with us. [CLS] [SEP] the information which
you supply to us enables us to customize and enhance the services we provide
to you. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, it helps us communicate with you about our news, events,
promotions and new products. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to subscribe to our paid subscription service, our third party
payment processors will collect and handle your credit card and related
payment information. [CLS] [SEP] such third party processors’ use of your personal
information is governed by their respective privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

##### collection of information as part of using pocket service

in addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a
user account, we collect information about the urls, titles and content of the
web pages and other information you save to pocket. [CLS] [SEP] the types of information
we collect includes your browser type, device type, time zone, language, and
other information related to the manner in which you access the pocket
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] if you are on a mobile device, we collect the advertising
identifiers provided by apple on ios and by google on android. [CLS] [SEP] you can change
this identifier in your device settings. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information about
your use of the pocket technologies so that we can provide our services. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, as a part of providing pocket’s syncing features, we sync information
about the items that you save and view within pocket so that your list, tags,
scroll position, and other account and usage information may be synced across
all of your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

##### use of cookies and analytics

 **types and purposes**

we use cookies and analytics tools for the following purposes:

  * necessary: these cookies are necessary for our website to function and cannot be switched off. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use them to manage your login state. [CLS] [SEP] you can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but this may cause parts of the site to not work properly. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * functional: we place these cookies on your device to remember your account preferences and language settings. [CLS] [SEP] disabling these cookies may break some features. [CLS] [SEP]
  * analytics: we place these cookies on your device to help us understand in the aggregate how users engage with our website and product. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use google analytics to understand which pocket webpages are popular. [CLS] [SEP] we also use pixels in our emails in order to collect usage information. [CLS] [SEP] disabling these cookies prevents us from including your engagement in our aggregate measurement. [CLS] [SEP]
  * advertising: some pocket web pages have ads. [CLS] [SEP] on those pages, our partners may place cookies on your device to measure impressions and clicks. [CLS] [SEP] some partners may further use these cookies to personalize ads you see on other websites. [CLS] [SEP] disabling these cookies prevents ad partners from knowing what stories you viewed on pocket and how you engaged with ads on those pages. [CLS] [SEP]

 **your choices**

  * cookie preference tool: by default, pocket sets functional and analytics cookies, and disables advertising cookies. [CLS] [SEP] you can manage these cookies from the cookie preferences tool. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1163-pocket-website-cookies-faq). [CLS] [SEP]
  * your browser: your browser preferences menu can help you manage cookies and prevent cross-site tracking. [CLS] [SEP]
  * google’s analytics opt-out: install the [google analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), which prohibits data transmission to google analytics. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition to the methods described above, we may also collect information
using cookies or other technologies when you access our website or use pocket
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] you may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in
that case you may not be able to use certain features, you may be required to
enter your password more frequently during a session, and you may be unable to
install or use certain pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] cookies and other technologies
make our pocket technologies easier to use and help us customize and
personalize the services we provide based on your interests and activities. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear gifs" or similar means
(individually or collectively "pixel tags") in connection with emails that we
send to our users in order to collect usage data. [CLS] [SEP] we use pixel tags, other
technologies and the information we collect to count users who have visited
certain pages on our website, to deliver branded services and to help
determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. [CLS] [SEP]

##### use of information

we use your personal information to respond to your requests and perform our
contract with you. [CLS] [SEP] we may do this, for example, by using your contact
information to respond to your inquiries, to provide customer support and to
supply any products or services you have requested. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you choose
to use the pocket technologies to share content with another person, we will
use the recipient's email address or user account information to provide that
service, but we will not use that email address for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

we also have a legitimate business interest to operate and improve our
services such as saving articles, videos, or other content to pocket and
making such content and recommendations available to you at a later time on
any device that you use to access the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] we also use non-
identifying, aggregated information to analyze the manner in which the pocket
technologies are used, which also allows us to improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] the
aggregated information we use includes the manner in which articles, videos,
or content has been accessed, saved and shared. [CLS] [SEP] we may use aggregated
information to offer a list of top sites or content, to make recommendations
to our users, to report on usage and trends, to improve the products and
services that we offer, or to develop new products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing of information

except as set forth below, we do not share any personally identifiable
information unless you expressly agree that we may do so. [CLS] [SEP]

###### public content

if you choose to make the content you save publicly available, we may share
that information with others in accordance with the options you select. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, if you choose to use the pocket technologies to share articles,
videos, or other content with another person, we will send an email on your
behalf to that person with a link to the content that you have chosen to
share. [CLS] [SEP]

###### aggregate data

we also share aggregated, non-personal data and related usage information,
which does not contain any personal information which can identify you or any
other individual user, with third parties, including content providers,
website operators, advertisers and publishers. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share with
a content provider a list of the most saved articles to pocket based on an
analysis of aggregated, anonymous user data, but we would not share with such
content provider any personal information regarding such users. [CLS] [SEP]

###### links to other sites and apps

if you choose to, you may connect your pocket account to third-party
applications to enable additional features like saving from your favorite apps
or other unique features third-party developers have created. [CLS] [SEP] we have set up
controls in the pocket application so that you can control the information
that is shared with third-party providers of products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, you may be informed that another app that you use wants to connect to
your pocket account. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, such apps will request access to certain
data in your pocket account, such as your pocket list or your preferred
topics, sites and authors (which we have developed based on the content you
have saved to pocket), so that they can customize their services. [CLS] [SEP] before such
access is provided, however, you will be asked to authorize the sharing of any
such information. [CLS] [SEP] although the pocket technologies may be used in conjunction
with third-party products and services, we are not affiliated with, and have
no control over, such third parties. [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise expressly included in
this privacy policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of
information we collect from you and we encourage you to check the privacy
policy of each third-party provider of products or services that you choose to
connect your pocket account to. [CLS] [SEP]

###### working with third parties

we may work with trusted third parties to facilitate one or more aspects of
the products,services, or features that we provide to you, and we may provide
some of your personal information directly to these third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, as discussed above, we may use a third party payment processor to
process payments for our paid subscription service. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share limited
aggregated data with our advertising partners (read more in the “aggregate
data” section above). [CLS] [SEP] these parties are subject to confidentiality agreements
with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the
information we provide to them for any other purpose other than those
discussed above, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior
permission to them for additional uses. [CLS] [SEP] if you use the "listen" feature, we
may share the content of the article with a third party service in order to
read the article aloud. [CLS] [SEP]

###### sharing as required by law or asset sale

in the event that we or certain of our assets are acquired, user information
may be included among the transferred assets. [CLS] [SEP]

although we strive to protect the personal information of our users, we will
release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief
that such action is necessary. [CLS] [SEP] we follow the law whenever we receive requests
about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you when
we are asked to hand over your personally identifiable information in this way
unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. [CLS] [SEP] when we receive requests like
this, we will only release your personally identifiable information if we have
a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary or appropriate under
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses
or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your
information. [CLS] [SEP]

##### keeping information

we will keep your information only for as long as we need it to provide you
services, manage our business or as required by law or contract. [CLS] [SEP]

##### transfer of information

we're a global organization and our computers are in several different places
around the world. [CLS] [SEP] we also use service providers whose computers may also be in
various countries. [CLS] [SEP] this means that your information might end up on one of
those computers in another country, and that country may have a different
level of data protection regulation than yours. [CLS] [SEP] by giving us information, you
consent to this kind of transfer of your information. [CLS] [SEP] no matter what country
your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by
the commitments we make in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### security

we have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures
in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of
the information under our control or under the control of our service
providers. [CLS] [SEP] your personally identifiable information is protected by utilizing
both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and
restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. [CLS] [SEP]
although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not
promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private
communications will always remain free from security issues. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a
security breach involving your personal information, we will make any legally
required disclosures to you in the most expedient time possible and without
unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate interests of law
enforcement, or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach
and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. [CLS] [SEP]

##### phishing

identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great
concern to pocket. [CLS] [SEP] safeguarding information to help protect you from identity
theft is a top priority. [CLS] [SEP] we do not and will not, at any time, request your
username, password, credit card information or national identification number
in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. [CLS] [SEP] for more information
about phishing, visit the federal trade commission’s website. [CLS] [SEP]

##### managing my privacy and email settings

you can access, correct, or delete your personal information and export your
data from your pocket profile. [CLS] [SEP] you can also view and control which third party
services, if any, you want to connect to your pocket account. [CLS] [SEP] these settings
are at: [https://getpocket.com/options](/options)

as part of our default settings to share saved and recommended content, we
send emails to our users. [CLS] [SEP] you may opt-out of receiving these, and updates on
our service and your use, by using the unsubscribe feature on any of our email
correspondence or from your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] we will try to communicate with
you only according to your instructions, although it may take some time to
process your request. [CLS] [SEP]

##### amendments to policy

please note this privacy policy will change from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] we may amend
this privacy policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our website
that you can access at [getpocket.com](/) or through the options or help menu
of the pocket application. [CLS] [SEP] all amended terms shall automatically be effective
thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the website. [CLS] [SEP] if we make
any material changes to our privacy policy that affect user information
already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website
notifying users that our privacy policy has changed. [CLS] [SEP] our use of your
information shall be governed by the terms and conditions of our privacy
policy in effect when you first use our application or thirty (30) after the
terms are changed, as explained above. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have questions about any of the provisions described above, please
contact us at [privacy@getpocket.com](mailto:privacy@getpocket.com) or at the
street address listed above. [CLS] [SEP]
