# visible service terms & conditions

welcome to visible! thanks for choosing us. [CLS] [SEP] your service terms and conditions
are part of this customer agreement (“agreement”) and are provided by visible
service llc (“visible”) or one of its affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] your voice, text, and data
services are for use within the visible coverage area. [CLS] [SEP] together, your plan and
any features you use are your service. [CLS] [SEP] the current version of this agreement
and the terms and conditions for your service are available online at
[visible.com](/?remember=true). [CLS] [SEP]

by using the service you are agreeing to every provision of this agreement
whether or not you have read it. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement also applies to anyone who
uses your service. [CLS] [SEP]

## cancellation

we’d hate to see you go, but you may cancel service for any reason at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] if your account has been activated, no refunds will be provided. [CLS] [SEP]

## privacy

by entering into this agreement, you agree to our data collection, use and
sharing practices described in our privacy policy, available at
[visible.com](/?remember=true). [CLS] [SEP]

## bring your wireless number to another carrier

you may be able to bring your wireless phone number, or "port", to another
carrier. [CLS] [SEP] if you port a number from us, we’ll be sad to see you go! but, if you
really want to leave us and port your number to another carrier, then we'll
treat it as though you asked us to cancel your service for that number. [CLS] [SEP] after
the porting is completed, you won't be able to use our service for that
number, and you won't be entitled to a refund of any balance on your account. [CLS] [SEP]
if you port a number to us, please be aware that we may not be able to provide
some services right away, such as 911 location services. [CLS] [SEP] you don't have any
rights to your wireless phone number, except for any right you may have to
port it. [CLS] [SEP]

## changes to the agreement or your service

we may change prices, the monthly cost or any other term of your service or
this agreement at any time, but we'll provide notice first. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t like
the change, remember you can cancel at any time. [CLS] [SEP] but, if you use your service
after the change takes effect, that means you're accepting the change. [CLS] [SEP] if we
make any changes to the dispute resolution provision of this agreement, such
changes will not affect the resolution of any disputes that arose before such
change. [CLS] [SEP]

## my wireless phone

your wireless phone must comply with federal communications commission
regulations, be certified for use on the network, and be compatible with your
service. [CLS] [SEP] we may change your wireless device's software, applications or
programming remotely, without notice. [CLS] [SEP] this could affect your stored data, or
how you've programmed or use your wireless device. [CLS] [SEP] by activating your sim
(subscriber identity module) card, you agree we own the intellectual property
and software in the sim card, that we may change the software or other data in
the sim card remotely and without notice, and we may utilize any capacity in
the sim card for administrative, network, business and/or commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## coverage and service availability

wireless devices use radio transmissions, so unfortunately you can't get
service if your device isn't in range of a transmission signal. [CLS] [SEP] and please be
aware that even within your network coverage area, many things can affect the
availability and quality of your service, including network capacity, your
device, terrain, buildings, foliage and weather. [CLS] [SEP] we may take any action to
protect and maintain the integrity of the network. [CLS] [SEP]

if you lose service for more than 24 hours in a row and we’re at fault,
contact us at [support@visible.com](mailto:support@visible.com) within 180
days and we’ll give you a credit for the time lost. [CLS] [SEP] this is your only right
for interrupted service. [CLS] [SEP]

## charges

you are responsible for paying all mandatory taxes and fees set by federal,
state, and local governments that we are required to collect and remit to the
government, but we’ve made it simple for you by including the taxes and fees
in the monthly cost on your bill statement. [CLS] [SEP]

## billing and payments

the availability of service depends on your payment in advance of the monthly
charge when it is due. [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to make payment when due, your service will
be suspended and/or cancelled. [CLS] [SEP] by making a payment, you will have access to
service for the designated period of time. [CLS] [SEP] if your account is deactivated for
non-payment, it will be suspended for 60 days. [CLS] [SEP] if payment is not made within
the 60 day period, it will be cancelled. [CLS] [SEP] when your account is cancelled, we
will re-assign the phone number associated with your account, and that phone
number may no longer be available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not provide you with monthly bills. [CLS] [SEP] you can access your account via
the visible app or on our website at [visible.com](/?remember=true). [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for paying your monthly charges for the service provided under
this agreement, including charges made by any person you permit to have direct
or indirect access to your phone even if you did not authorize its use. [CLS] [SEP]

## lost or stolen devices

we're always here to help! it's important that you notify us right away at
[visible.com](/?remember=true), so we can suspend your service to keep someone
else from using it. [CLS] [SEP]

## our right to limit or end service or end this agreement

we can, without notice, limit, suspend or end your service or this agreement
with you for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if you: (a)
breach this agreement; (b) resell your service; (c) primarily use data on
other wireless companies’ networks; (d) use your service for any illegal
purpose, including use that violates trade and economic sanctions and
prohibitions promulgated by any us governmental agency; (e) install, deploy or
use any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a repeater)
to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate an rf signal without
our permission; (f) if we are permanently unable to provide service to you; or
(2) if you, any user of your device or any line of service on your account, or
any account manager on your account: (a) threaten, harass, or use vulgar
and/or inappropriate language toward our representatives; (b) interfere with
our operations; (c) "spam," or engage in other abusive messaging or calling;
(d) modify your device from its manufacturer's specifications; or (e) use your
service in a way that negatively affects our network or other customers. [CLS] [SEP] we
can also temporarily limit your service for any operational or governmental
reason. [CLS] [SEP]

## disclaimer of warranties

we make no representations or warranties, express or implied, including, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, any implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, about your service, your
wireless device, or any applications you access through your wireless device. [CLS] [SEP]
we do not warrant that your wireless device will work perfectly or will not
need occasional upgrades or modifications, or that it will not be negatively
affected by network–related modifications, upgrades or similar activity. [CLS] [SEP] if
you download or use applications, services or software provided by third
parties (including voice applications), 911 or e911, or other calling
functionality, may work differently than services offered by us, or may not
work at all. [CLS] [SEP] please review all terms and conditions of such third–party
products. [CLS] [SEP] visible is not responsible for any third–party information, content,
applications or services you access, download or use on your device. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for maintaining virus and other internet security protections when
accessing these third–party products or services. [CLS] [SEP]

## waivers and limitations of liability

you and visible both agree to limit claims against each other for damages or
other monetary relief to direct damages. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation and waiver will apply
regardless of the theory of liability. [CLS] [SEP] that means neither of us will try to
get any indirect, special, consequential, treble or punitive damages from the
other. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation and waiver also applies if you bring a claim against
one of our suppliers, to the extent we would be required to indemnify the
supplier for the claim. [CLS] [SEP] you agree we aren't responsible for problems caused by
you or others, or by any act of god. [CLS] [SEP]

## dispute resolution

we hope to make you a happy customer! most customer concerns can be quickly
resolved by contacting customer support. [CLS] [SEP] you can dispute charges for any
service(s) within 180 days of the date the disputed charge was incurred by
emailing us at [support@visible.com](mailto:support@visible.com). [CLS] [SEP]

but if you wish to preserve your right to bring an arbitration or small claims
case regarding such dispute, you must write to us at
[visiblearbitrations@visible.com](mailto:visiblearbitrations@visible.com), if
you do not notify us in writing of such dispute within the 180-day period, you
will have waived your right to dispute the charge(s) and to bring an
arbitration or small claims case regarding any such dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

you and visible both agree to resolve disputes only by arbitration or in small
claims court. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that by this agreement you are giving up the
right to bring a claim in court or in front of a jury. [CLS] [SEP] while the procedures
may be different, an arbitrator can award you the same damages and relief, and
must honor the same terms in this agreement, as a court would. [CLS] [SEP] if the law
allows for an award of attorneys' fees, an arbitrator can award them too. [CLS] [SEP] we
also both agree that:

(1) the federal arbitration act applies to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] except for small
claims court cases, any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of
this agreement or from any equipment, products and services you receive from
us (or from any advertising for any such products or services), including any
disputes you have with our employees or agents, will be resolved by one or
more neutral arbitrators before the american arbitration association ("aaa"). [CLS] [SEP]
you can also bring any issues you may have to the attention of federal, state,
or local government agencies, and if the law allows, they can seek relief
against us for you. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to arbitrate continues to apply even after
you have stopped receiving service from us. [CLS] [SEP]

(2) unless you and visible agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in
the county of your billing address. [CLS] [SEP] for claims over $10,000, the aaa's
consumer arbitration rules will apply. [CLS] [SEP] for claims of $10,000 or less, the
party bringing the claim can choose the aaa's consumer arbitration rules or,
alternatively, can bring an individual action in small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] you can
get procedures, rules and fee information from the aaa
([www.adr.org](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.adr.org&d=dwmfaq&c=udbtrvfvxc5dhqg7uhpjlpps3mz3lrxpb6__0pombtq&r=sqh05x-du_jcouspznraoiwgfrtwuugv48kbnluwblo&m=y7ilxohacxcpg81wbjpjha4nm8rkxq4wnb8-_qttt20&s=akq7aybtmvcluf_blcfseka6x7ye8rh7dhb_0j-qjsw&e=)). [CLS] [SEP]
for claims of $10,000 or less, you can choose whether you'd like the
arbitration carried out based only on documents submitted to the arbitrator,
or by a hearing in person or by phone. [CLS] [SEP]

(3) this agreement doesn't allow class or collective arbitrations even if the
aaa procedures or rules would. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding any other provision of this
agreement, the arbitrator may award money or injunctive relief only in favor
of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] no class or
representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers
for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] any
question regarding the enforceability or interpretation of this paragraph
shall be decided by a court and not the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

(4) if either of us intends to seek arbitration under this agreement, the
party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in
writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] notice to
visible should be sent to visible dispute resolution manager at
[visiblearbitrations@visible.com](mailto:visiblearbitrations@visible.com). [CLS] [SEP] the
notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. [CLS] [SEP] if
we are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then
proceed to file a claim for arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] we'll reimburse any filing fee that
the aaa charges you for arbitration of the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide us with
signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, visible will pay the
fee directly to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] if that arbitration proceeds, we'll also pay any
administrative and arbitrator fees charged later. [CLS] [SEP]

(5) we may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime
before the arbitration hearing. [CLS] [SEP] the amount or terms of any settlement offer
may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an
award on the claim. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't accept the offer and the arbitrator awards
you an amount of money that's more than our offer but less than $5,000, or if
we don't make you an offer, and the arbitrator awards you any amount of money
but less than $5,000, then we agree to pay you $5,000 instead of the amount
awarded. [CLS] [SEP] in that case we also agree to pay any reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, regardless of whether the law requires it for your case. [CLS] [SEP] if the
arbitrator awards you more than $5,000, then we will pay you only that amount. [CLS] [SEP]

(6) an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that
specific case; it can't be used in any other case except to enforce the award
itself. [CLS] [SEP]

(7) if for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in
subsection (3) cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not
apply. [CLS] [SEP]

(8) if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through
arbitration, you and visible agree that there will not be a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] you
and visible unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this agreement in any
way. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written
consent to a trial by the court. [CLS] [SEP]

## about this agreement

if we don't enforce our rights under this agreement in one instance, that
doesn't mean we won't or can't enforce those rights in any other instance. [CLS] [SEP] you
can’t assign this agreement or any of your rights or duties under it without
our permission. [CLS] [SEP] however, we may assign this agreement or any debt you owe us
without notifying you. [CLS] [SEP]

if we send notices to you, they will be considered received immediately if we
send them to your wireless device or to any email that you’ve given us. [CLS] [SEP] if you
need to send notices to us, please send them to
[support@visible.com](mailto:support@visible.com). [CLS] [SEP]

if any part of this agreement, including anything regarding the arbitration
process (except for the prohibition on class arbitrations as explained in part
7 of the dispute resolution section above), is ruled invalid, that part may be
removed from this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

this agreement and the documents it incorporates form the entire agreement
between us. [CLS] [SEP] you can't rely on any other documents, and you have no other
rights regarding service or this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement isn't for the
benefit of any third party except our affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and
predecessors and successors in interest. [CLS] [SEP] except where we've agreed otherwise
elsewhere in this agreement, this agreement and any disputes covered by it are
governed by federal law and the laws of the state encompassing the area code
of your wireless phone number when you accepted this agreement, without regard
to the conflicts of laws and rules of that state. [CLS] [SEP]
