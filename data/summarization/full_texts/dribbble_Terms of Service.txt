# terms of service

read our terms below to learn more about your rights and responsibilities as a
dribbble user. [CLS] [SEP]

## updated febuary 17, 2021

this terms of service (the “ **terms** ”) describes the rights and
responsibilities that apply to your use of dribbble’s websites, services, and
mobile app (collectively, the “service”), each owned and operated by dribbble
holdings ltd. [CLS] [SEP] (“ **dribbble** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **our** ” or “ **us** ”). [CLS] [SEP]

please read the terms carefully before using the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t agree
to the terms, as well as [dribbble’s privacy policy](/privacy) (the “
**privacy policy** ”) and dribbble’s [community guidelines](/guidelines) (the
“ **community guidelines** ”), you may not use the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
entering into the terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you
represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you
do not have such authority, you must not accept the terms or use the service
on behalf of such entity. [CLS] [SEP] the service is only available to you if you have
entered the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence and are fully
able and competent to enter into, abide by and comply with the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **your dribbble account.** if you create an account on the service (your “ **account** ”), you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and its content (as defined below), and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken on the service. [CLS] [SEP] you must not describe or assign content to your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and dribbble may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause dribbble liability. [CLS] [SEP] you must immediately notify dribbble of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. [CLS] [SEP] dribbble will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. [CLS] [SEP]

for paid accounts (each, a “ **paid account** ”), dribbble deems the person
under whose name appears on the credit or charge card or other payment method
that pays the charges for the service to be the owner of the paid account. [CLS] [SEP] if
a corporate or other organization’s name appears on the credit or charge card
or other payment method, that corporation or organization is deemed to be the
owner. [CLS] [SEP] if any dispute arises as to who owns or controls a paid account, your
most recently provided payment method will continue to be charged and you will
be responsible to pay for the service until dribbble receives written
confirmation from the paid account email address confirming a change in
ownership and control of the paid account. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **fees and renewals.** pricing for paid accounts will be provided at the time of purchase. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise set out at the time of purchase or as agreed to by dribbble, fees for a paid account will be billed in advance for each year and are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] there will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service or for periods in which your paid account remains open but you do not use the service. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to modify our billing rates at any time upon thirty (30)
days written notice by posting such fee changes to the service or through
email notification to you. [CLS] [SEP] you will be liable to pay such modified billing
rates. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to your payment of applicable fees for a paid account, we will provide
the service to you for the period of time that you have paid for such service
(the “subscription period”). [CLS] [SEP] at the end of the subscription period, your paid
account subscription will automatically renew for an additional subscription
period until it is expressly cancelled by you as described in the
“termination” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

if you purchase any fee-based service, you agree that our third party payment
gateways, such as stripe and paypal, may store your credit or charge card or
other payment information. [CLS] [SEP] you expressly agree that we are authorized to
charge you (i) a fee for any applicable service for which you have subscribed,
billed on a basis of the subscription period, (ii) any other fees for the
service you may purchase, (iii) any charges for use of the service in excess
of the usage or other limits placed on your use of the service (and you hereby
consent to such charges and agree we are not required to notify you of any
such charge in advance) and (iv) any applicable taxes in connection with your
use of the service to the credit or charge card you provide and to reimburse
us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. [CLS] [SEP] if the
credit or charge card you provide expires and you do not provide new credit or
charge card information or cancel your account, you authorize us to continue
billing you and you agree to remain responsible for any uncollected fees. [CLS] [SEP]

you take full responsibility for all taxes and fees of any nature associated
with the service, including any sales tax related to any purchase or sale of
services or goods under the terms. [CLS] [SEP] when purchasing or selling services or
goods under the terms, it is your responsibility to determine whether or not
sales taxes apply to a transaction and to collect, report and remit the
correct amounts to the appropriate authority. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **your responsibilities.** if you operate an account, comment on a screenshot, post material to the service, post links on the service, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the service (any such material, “ **content** ”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that content. [CLS] [SEP] that is the case regardless of whether the content in question constitutes text or graphics. [CLS] [SEP] by making content available, you represent and warrant that:

    * the content is not obscene, libelous or defamatory, hateful or racially or ethnically objectionable, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
    * your account is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;
    * your account is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your account’s url or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own; and
    * you have, in the case of content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by dribbble or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

by uploading content or otherwise providing content to dribbble, you grant
dribbble the right to use (including the right to host, index, cache and
format) and display your content in connection with providing the service as
well as otherwise on the site and our marketing communications with you and
other users and prospective users of the service, including without limitation
on our emails, marketing channels and other promotional materials (subject to
the requirements set out in the privacy policy). [CLS] [SEP] to the extent we use your
content in our marketing communications, unless you expressly permit us to do
otherwise, we will always cite you as the owner of such content. [CLS] [SEP] this
paragraph will survive the termination or expiry of the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

dribbble reserves the right to refuse or remove any content or terminate or
deny access to your use of the service for any reason whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP] please read
the community guidelines for rules and advice on what types of content and
uses of the service are appropriate at dribbble. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] you agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of dribbble. [CLS] [SEP] dribbble will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claims upon becoming aware of it. [CLS] [SEP]

  13. [CLS] [SEP] **miscellaneous.** if there is any dispute between you and dribbble about or involving the terms, the service, you hereby agree that the dispute will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of british columbia, canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

disputes arising out of or in connection with the terms will be referred to

be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of the terms
that is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that the terms are specifically enforceable by dribbble through
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary
damages. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that if dribbble does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
remedy which is contained in the terms (or which dribbble has the benefit of
under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
dribbble’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to
dribbble. [CLS] [SEP]

the terms are the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in
the terms. [CLS] [SEP] the terms replace and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous
agreement, representation or discussion, oral or written, and may not be
changed except in writing signed by us, regardless of whether or not the
parties act under an unsigned “electronic” agreement or rely on such an
unsigned agreement. [CLS] [SEP]
