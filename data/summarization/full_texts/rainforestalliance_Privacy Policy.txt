### how we use the information we collect and receive

we use the information we collect and receive for the following purposes:

  * processing the information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, or
  * the processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest, or
  * processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or
  * you have given consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

more specifically, we collect and receive information for the following
purposes:

**to provide our services and to enforce any applicable terms of service**. [CLS] [SEP] we
use the information we collect and receive to provide you with the services
you use or request, and as needed in order to enter into or perform terms of
service. [CLS] [SEP]

**to provide additional information about rainforest alliance’s work**. [CLS] [SEP] this
information includes updates on projects, new website features, invitations to
special events, and opportunities to contribute financially. [CLS] [SEP] you will have a
possibility to opt out any time you receive this type of information from us. [CLS] [SEP]

**to improve our services**. [CLS] [SEP] we also use the information we collect and
receive to provide content you or other users are likely to find relevant and
engaging. [CLS] [SEP] we also use the information to conduct surveys to measure your
satisfaction with our services, which we use to improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]
information collected will allow us to adjust and improve our websites to your
wishes and needs and to be able to prepare anonymized statistics about the use
of our websites. [CLS] [SEP] using the information to improve our services is in our
legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP]

**to provide effective advertising**. [CLS] [SEP] you may receive advertising on third-
party websites and apps such as google adwords, facebook, and instagram. [CLS] [SEP] we
use the information we collect and receive to advertise and to make the
advertising we provide more effective, which is in our legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP]
some of the ways we do this are:

  * showing you ads based on your online activities, such as your geographic location, the languages you speak, the keywords that you use on search engines, and the types of social media content that you “like” and/or follow, and website content you view;
  * limiting the number of times you see the same ad; and
  * measuring the effectiveness of the ads you see. [CLS] [SEP]

### how we share the information we collect and receive

**third parties**. [CLS] [SEP] we may share certain information we collect or receive with
third parties to provide products and services you have requested, when we
have your consent, or as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share information with:

  * _affiliates_. [CLS] [SEP] the information one rainforest alliance affiliate receives can be shared among other rainforest alliance affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _business partners_. [CLS] [SEP] we may share information with select business partners, who may use the information, (including to provide you with relevant advertising in the u.s.) or to collect and make payments for services, donations or royalties and to confirm audit data. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _other parties_ in response to legal process or when necessary to protect our services. [CLS] [SEP] we may disclose your information to other parties when we have a good faith belief that: 
    * it is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal processes (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
    * the information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
    * an emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person; or
    * it is necessary to protect the rights or property of the rainforest alliance. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event that the ownership of the rainforest alliance or an affiliate or
their assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or
in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to
another company. [CLS] [SEP]

**online training platforms**. [CLS] [SEP] all information collected or received by the
rainforest alliance’s online training platforms is used to measure the impact
of the platforms. [CLS] [SEP] to that end, rainforest alliance will provide information
such as the level of completion of courses and grades earned to the
participants and, in some cases, their employer. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, the rainforest
alliance may share de-identified, aggregate information on the performance of
participants and the impact of the online training platforms with rainforest
alliance affiliates and business partners. [CLS] [SEP]

**individual donors**. [CLS] [SEP] from time to time, we do make the street addresses of
individuals who reside in the united states and who donate to the rainforest
alliance available to other not-for-profit organizations whose missions we
think might also be of interest to the individual. [CLS] [SEP] this applies to donors who
give online, through the mail, or by phone. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want us to share
your street address with other organizations, please let us know by calling us
at the number provided below; emailing us at the email address provided below,
or writing to us at the street address provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

**companies or individuals that provide services to the rainforest alliance**. [CLS] [SEP]
companies or individuals that provide services to the rainforest alliance or
act on our behalf may have access to information about you. [CLS] [SEP] these companies
are limited in their ability to use information they receive in the course of
providing service to us for any purposes other than the services for which we
have engaged them. [CLS] [SEP]

**third parties that provide content, advertising services, or functionality
on our online services**. [CLS] [SEP] some of the content, advertising, and functionality
on our services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with
us. [CLS] [SEP] such third parties include:

  * advertising providers, which help us and our advertising customers provide ads that are tailored to users' interests and understand how users respond to those ads; and
  * audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our services and compare that usage to other online services. [CLS] [SEP]

some of these companies may participate in industry-developed programs
designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted
ads. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more, please visit the websites of the [network advertising
initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and the [digital advertising
alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). [CLS] [SEP]
