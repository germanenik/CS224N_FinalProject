###### effective june 19, 2020

  

your information and your privacy are important — to you and to us. [CLS] [SEP] this
policy explains how we use your information and how we keep it safe. [CLS] [SEP] most
importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your
information is used. [CLS] [SEP]



#### when this policy applies

this privacy policy (“policy”) covers the information generated when you use
or subscribe to at&t products, services, apps, websites or networks to which
this policy is linked. [CLS] [SEP] in the policy, we call them “products or services” for
short. [CLS] [SEP] they include voice, data, video, entertainment, advertising, internet
and other products, services and apps. [CLS] [SEP]

this policy applies to you and anyone who uses our products or services under
your account, except where we identify for you that separate at&t privacy
policies or terms and conditions apply. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for making sure
all users under your account understand and agree to this policy. [CLS] [SEP] click “learn
more” for a description of special circumstances where this policy may not
apply or may apply in addition to other policies. [CLS] [SEP]

here are special circumstances where this policy may not apply, or may apply
in addition to other policies:

  * some of our products or services – for example the at&t tv app and our firstnet service – may be covered by their own privacy policies or additional privacy terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP]
  * some of our affiliates – such as warnermedia companies and cricket – have their own privacy policies that apply to data they collect from products, services and apps they provide. [CLS] [SEP] any data collected subject to this policy that is shared with those affiliates will still be protected consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
  * some areas both inside and outside of the united states - for example california and the european union - require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in certain cases, when you’re using your at&t products or services, other companies may be collecting information, so that your information may be covered by this policy and other privacy policies at the same time. [CLS] [SEP] here are some examples: if you purchase one of our products or services from a retailer; if you use our services to connect to a social networking service or another company’s wi-fi network; or if you provide your information to another company through a co-branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. [CLS] [SEP] in those cases, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their policy and ours. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you are an at&t business customer, we may have written product or service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. [CLS] [SEP] when one of those agreements differs from or conflicts with this policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead. [CLS] [SEP]

##### **sharing information across the at &t affiliates**

like many large companies, at&t is made up of many affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]  our products
and services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our
affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] we share information that may identify you personally internally
among our affiliates _button icon_, such as xandr, the warnermedia family of
companies and cricket. [CLS] [SEP]  you can learn more about at&t affiliates by going to
[att.com](https://www.att.com/). [CLS] [SEP] for information collected under this policy,
we require the affiliate to protect the information consistent with this
policy. [CLS] [SEP]  we may also combine information that identifies you personally with
data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
when we do that, our policy applies to the combined data set. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing information with non-at&t companies that provide services for us
or for you

we share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform
services for us or that support products or services provided to you,
including marketing or ad delivery services. [CLS] [SEP] we do not require consent for
sharing with our vendors for these purposes. [CLS] [SEP]  we do not allow those vendors to
use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and
we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get
from us in a way that’s consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]  

##### sharing information with non-at&t companies to enable third party
services to you

we may share information with non-at&t companies for their purposes to provide
you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting
fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. [CLS] [SEP] we
require proof of your explicit consent before sharing your information that
identifies you personally for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP]  we do not allow those non-at&t
companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and
we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get
from us in a way that’s consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, to
facilitate these programs, we will use or share identifiers such as your phone
or account number. [CLS] [SEP]  these identifiers are only used for network
authentication, to detect fraud, for identity verification, or for the linking
of devices you own to authenticate you. [CLS] [SEP]  

##### sharing information with other non-at&t companies or entities

there are also times when we provide information that identifies you
personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies,
credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your explicit consent, but
where authorized or required by law. [CLS] [SEP] reasons to share include:

  * complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. [CLS] [SEP] like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits. [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more about this in our [transparency report](/csr/home/governance/transparency.html). [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing metrics reports with non-at&t companies

sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. [CLS] [SEP]
we may pay a network for the rights to broadcast a sporting event or your
favorite show on our television service. [CLS] [SEP]  we may be paid by an advertiser to
deliver an advertisement or by a business customer to provide its employee
with a service. [CLS] [SEP]  in such cases, we may use or share information that doesn’t
identify you personally to provide metrics reports to our business customers
and service suppliers. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share it with advertising and other
companies to deliver or assess the effectiveness of advertising and marketing
campaigns. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing information for research

we may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other
companies and entities for research. [CLS] [SEP]  when we share this information, we
require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to
use it to identify individuals. [CLS] [SEP]  our agreements will also prevent businesses
from reusing or reselling the information, and require that they will handle
it in a secure manner, consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing information for aggregate media research reports

we share tv and video viewing information, tied to identifiers that do not
identify you personally, with media research companies. [CLS] [SEP] they combine this data
with other information to provide audience analysis services about what shows
certain audience segments are watching. [CLS] [SEP]  we require that they only use it to
compile aggregate reports, and for no other purpose. [CLS] [SEP] we also require
businesses to agree they will not attempt to identify any person using this
information, and that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with
this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing information with at&t affiliates and non-at&t companies for
advertising and marketing programs

we may share information with at&t affiliates and with non-at&t companies to
deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as
described in privacy choices and controls. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sharing information to support location services

location services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to
provide or enhance the service. [CLS] [SEP] location services may collect and use or share
location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-
loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps,
or other location services you subscribe to. [CLS] [SEP]  at&t will not share your
location information for location services without your consent (to us or a
company providing you service), except as required by law. [CLS] [SEP]  if you purchase
location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device, the
use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between
you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the
service provider, and is not governed by this privacy policy _. [CLS] [SEP]   _in other
cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the
location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the
location services and provide the required consent. [CLS] [SEP]  

##### disclosing personally identifiable information collected from satellite
and internet protocol television subscribers in response to a court order

when a non-governmental entity obtains a court order, we’re authorized to
disclose personally identifiable information collected from tv subscribers as
a result of the subscriber's use of tv service, but only after we let the
subscriber know what’s going on. [CLS] [SEP] when a governmental entity obtains a court
order, we’re authorized to disclose personally identifiable information
collected from a tv subscriber as a result of the subscriber's use of tv
service, but only if the following conditions are met:

  * a judge decides that the governmental entity has offered clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case; and
  * the subject of the information has an opportunity to appear and contest the governmental entity's claim; and
  * we have provided notice to the subscriber as required by applicable state law. [CLS] [SEP]

###### california consumer privacy act (ccpa)

**ccpa personal information** (ccpa pi) is defined by california law as
information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being
associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with
california consumers or households. [CLS] [SEP]

###### the information we collect and share

we want to provide you with the information about how to exercise rights
involving ccpa pi. [CLS] [SEP] here is information about the ccpa pi we have collected
from and shared about consumers over the past year. [CLS] [SEP] ****

**_information we collected from consumers_**

the ccpa identifies a number of categories of ccpa pi. [CLS] [SEP] in the year before the
date this policy was issued, we collected these categories of ccpa pi:

  * address and other identifiers – such as name, postal address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers. [CLS] [SEP]
  * unique and online identifiers associated with personal information – ip address, device ids, or other similar identifiers. [CLS] [SEP]
  * commercial information – such as records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * internet, gaming or other electronic network activity information – such as browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * professional or educational information. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * video footage (e.g., cctv); audio recordings; photographs; calendar information. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * location information (see above in "the information we collect"). [CLS] [SEP]
  * in game or online viewing activities (e.g., videos viewed, pages viewed). [CLS] [SEP]
  * inferences drawn from ccpa pi, such as individual profiles, preferences, characteristics, behaviors. [CLS] [SEP]

we collected the above categories of ccpa pi for the following purposes:

  * performing services on behalf of the business, such as customer service, processing or fulfilling orders, and processing payments. [CLS] [SEP]

  * generated by your use of our services – such as technical, equipment and usage information
  * social media sites and other online platforms
  * other companies – such as vendors, marketing firms and other at&t companies

**_information we shared about consumers_**

in the year before the date this policy was issued, we shared these categories
of ccpa pi with entities that provide services for us, like processing your
bill:

a password protected account – or have a firstnet, prepaid or .net account –

this information to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] we will delete it after the time
expires allowed by the ccpa to process and respond to your request. [CLS] [SEP]

we sell ccpa pi of consumers under 16 years of age. [CLS] [SEP] if we collect ccpa pi that
