### a few more legalities

please read the following very carefully. [CLS] [SEP] each of the following sections
applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] where jurisdictions do not
allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in
contracts, the contents of this section may not apply. [CLS] [SEP]

### indemnity

all the things you do and all the information you submit or post to
adventurerâs codex remain your responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] indemnity is basically a way
of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user
content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or
person in any way. [CLS] [SEP]

specifically, you agree to hold adventurerâs codex, its affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers
harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses,
expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneysâ fees and costs,

any third party or person. [CLS] [SEP]

adventurerâs codex is provided âas isâ and without warranty of any kind. [CLS] [SEP]
to the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party
service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied,
including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any
other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or
electronic. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or
mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. [CLS] [SEP] we do not guarantee
that adventurerâs codex will always work properly. [CLS] [SEP]

### limitation of liability

we will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental,
punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any
other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement
or your use of or attempt to use adventurerâs codex, including (but not
limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. [CLS] [SEP] this
limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of
the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] some states do not allow for the exclusion of
implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental
or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] you
may have other rights that vary from state to state. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers,
and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims,

known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way
connected to your use of adventurerâs codex. [CLS] [SEP]

its provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to this
user agreement, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the
state of delaware without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. [CLS] [SEP] we agree
and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state
and federal court located in san diego county, california. [CLS] [SEP]

### severability and enforcement

if any provision of this user agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that
provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable
without losing its intent. [CLS] [SEP]

if no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the
rest of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if we do not enforce any right or provision in this
user agreement, that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the
future. [CLS] [SEP]

### changes to this user agreement

adventurerâs codex. [CLS] [SEP] it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements
