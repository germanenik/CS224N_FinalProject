[CLS] [SEP] by accepting this agreement, you agree to the arbitration agreement in this section 15 (subject to the limited one-time right to opt out within thirty (30) days belonging to members who first created an account or used the service prior to may 9, 2018 (such members, âlegacy members"), discussed below). [CLS] [SEP] in doing so, both you and tinder give up the right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and tinder (except for matters that may be properly taken to a small claims court and are within such courtâs jurisdiction). [CLS] [SEP] you also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding, including, without limitation, any past, pending or future class actions, including those existing as of the date of this agreement, which include without limitation: allan candelore v. [CLS] [SEP] tinder, inc., los angeles superior court, state of california, county of los angeles, case no. [CLS] [SEP] bc583162 (generally claiming, on behalf of california citizens who subscribed to tinder plus when they were at least 30 years old that tinder violated the california unruh civil rights act by charging older subscribers a higher price than tinder charged subscribers younger than 30) and kim v. [CLS] [SEP] tinder, inc., united states district court, central district of california, case no. [CLS] [SEP] 2:18-cv-03093 generally claiming, on behalf of california citizens who subscribed to tinder plus when they were at least 30 years old that tinder violated the california unruh civil rights act by charging older subscribers a higher price than tinder charged subscribers younger than 30). [CLS] [SEP] this list may not be exhaustive, and there may be other currently pending actions against tinder. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] if you assert a claim against tinder outside of small claims court (and tinder does not request that the claim be moved to small claims court), your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] the same is true for tinder. [CLS] [SEP] both you and tinder are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator can generally grant the relief that a court can, including the ability to hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive motion based upon the partiesâ pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion based upon the partiesâ pleadings along with the evidence submitted), but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. [CLS] [SEP] for details on the arbitration process, see our [arbitration procedures](/arbitration) . [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the jurisdiction and venue provisions in sections 16 and 17 are incorporated and are applicable to this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

as you decide whether to agree to this arbitration agreement, here are some
important considerations:

  * arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury. [CLS] [SEP] instead, the partiesâ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties under the jams streamlined arbitration rules & procedures. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you as an individual may bring against tinder. [CLS] [SEP] agreeing to arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought and how they will be resolved. [CLS] [SEP]
  * arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always the case. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will typically determine whether tinder or you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with tinder, based on the circumstances presented. [CLS] [SEP]
  * important: there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against tinder alleging class and/or representative claims on your behalf including but not limited to class actions described in this section 15, which if successful, could potentially result in some monetary or other recovery to you, if you elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the mere existence of such class and/or representative lawsuits, however, does not mean that such lawsuits will ultimately succeed, or, even if successful, that you would be entitled to any recovery. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action against tinder, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive application of this arbitration agreement, and you will also be precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought against tinder, in each case provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and class action waiver previously agreed to with tinder. [CLS] [SEP]

whether to agree to this arbitration agreement is an important decision. [CLS] [SEP] it is
your decision to make, and you should take care to conduct further research
and to consult with others â including but not limited to an attorney â
regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any
other important business or life decision. [CLS] [SEP]

if for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be invalid, you will
nevertheless still be bound by any prior valid arbitration agreement that you
entered into with tinder. [CLS] [SEP]
