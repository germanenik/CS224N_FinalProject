downloaded to your device when you visit a website. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are then sent back
to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website
that recognises that cookie. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are widely used because they allow a
website to recognise a user’s device and therefore allow enhanced
functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] definitions

**first party/ third party cookies**

refers to the web domain placing the cookie. [CLS] [SEP] first-party cookies are those set
by a website that is being visited by the user at the time – the website
displayed in the url window. [CLS] [SEP] third party cookies are cookies that are set by a
domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. [CLS] [SEP] if a user
visits a website and another entity sets the cookie through that website, this
would be a third-party cookie. [CLS] [SEP]

**persistent cookies**

these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in
the cookie. [CLS] [SEP] they are activated each time that the user visits the website that
created that particular cookie. [CLS] [SEP]

**session cookies**

these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a
browser session. [CLS] [SEP] a browser session starts when a user opens the browser window
and finishes when they close the browser window. [CLS] [SEP] session cookies are created
temporarily. [CLS] [SEP] once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

**pixel tags**

a pixel tag is not technically a cookie but is a similar type of technology
placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking
activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used
in combination with cookies. [CLS] [SEP] information collected is anonymous. [CLS] [SEP]
