# privacy policylast modified: 2020-11-10

the original version of this privacy policy is written in english. [CLS] [SEP] to the
extent any translated version of this privacy policy conflicts with the
english version, the english version controls. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (" **tumblr** ," " **we** ," " **us** ," or " **our** ") takes
the private nature of your information very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] this policy regarding
our privacy practices (the " **privacy policy** ") describes how we treat the
information we collect when you visit and use tumblr.com (the " **site** ")
and/or tumblr's other domains, products, advertising products, services,
and/or content, including our ios and android mobile applications
(collectively with the site, the " **services** "). [CLS] [SEP] tumblr is a subsidiary of
[automattic](https://automattic.com), a technology company that empowers
people to build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow
their audience. [CLS] [SEP] the way we handle your information hasn’t changed, so this
privacy policy still governs when you are on tumblr, using a tumblr app or
interacting with our products, services or technologies. [CLS] [SEP] we may share non-
personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product
improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more
relevant experiences. [CLS] [SEP] when you use the services, you also consent to the
collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
information as described in this privacy policy; please read it carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

## what this privacy policy covers

this privacy policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are
using or accessing the services. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy also covers our treatment
of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share
with our partners. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we
do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party
websites, services, applications, or businesses (“ **third party services**
”). [CLS] [SEP] while we try to work only with those third party services that share our
respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or
privacy policies of those third party services. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to carefully
review the privacy policies of all third party services you access. [CLS] [SEP]

also: this privacy policy doesn't govern what our users do on their tumblr
blogs and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use
practices of our individual blogs and bloggers. [CLS] [SEP] one of the great features of
tumblr's products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility
in how their blogs behave. [CLS] [SEP] when you visit a blog in our network, that blog may
collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third
parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers. [CLS] [SEP]

## what we collect and how we use it

 **account information:** when you create an account on the services (an "
**account** "), we’ll ask you for information such as your username, password,
age, and email address (“ **account information** ”). [CLS] [SEP] we may use account
information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve
the services, such as by personalization. [CLS] [SEP] we use your age to verify that you
can lawfully use the services. [CLS] [SEP] we use your email address to verify your
account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below. [CLS] [SEP] we
also allow users to look for their friends by email address; you can, however,
opt out of email lookup through your [account settings](/settings/account). [CLS] [SEP]

you can keep yourself fairly anonymous on tumblr, but remember that your
posts, blogs, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default. [CLS] [SEP]
people that know your email address can also find your blogs. [CLS] [SEP] if you’d rather
be unlisted, head over to your [account settings](/settings/account). [CLS] [SEP]

**email communications with us:** as part of the services, you may
occasionally receive email and other communications from us. [CLS] [SEP] administrative
communications relating to your account (e.g., for purposes of account
recovery or password reset) are considered part of the services and your
account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. [CLS] [SEP] we also may send
you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your account
settings page or by using the “opt-out” link in the emails themselves. [CLS] [SEP] **note
that we will _never_ email you to ask for your password or other account
information; if you receive such an email, please [forward it to
us](/support).**

we send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on tumblr, and ones
with important information about your account. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out of the former,
but not the latter. [CLS] [SEP]

**information about your accounts on third party services:** you can link your
account to certain third party services. [CLS] [SEP] in order to do so, you may provide us
with your username or other user id for a third party service, and you may
then be required to log into that service. [CLS] [SEP] after you complete this login
process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that
service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when
you ask us to. [CLS] [SEP] we do not receive or store your passwords for your third party
service accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

**information obtained from third party services:** in some cases, we partner
with third party services that may provide information about you. [CLS] [SEP] such
information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed
that information to that third party and made it available for tumblr to
access. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new
services or to improve or enhance the services. [CLS] [SEP]

when you connect other services to your tumblr account, those services might
share information about you with us. [CLS] [SEP] what gets shown to us is determined by
their privacy policies, which are long and boring, but which you should
probably read if you have questions or concerns. [CLS] [SEP]

**user content:** by default, all sharing through the services is public, and
when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. [CLS] [SEP]
although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, asks, and fan
mail, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything
you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected
otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with
another user, particularly through an ask, fan mail, or submitted post, may be
posted publicly by that user. [CLS] [SEP] content published and shared publicly is
accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy
rights you might have regarding that content. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, information shared
publicly may be copied and shared throughout the internet, including through
actions or features native to the services, such as reblogging. [CLS] [SEP]

at its heart, tumblr is a public platform. [CLS] [SEP] don't be afraid to share amazing
things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from
the internet once they've been reblogged a few times. [CLS] [SEP]

**native actions:** the services allow you to perform native actions that are
integral to our products, such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying
to a post, and following a blog. [CLS] [SEP] liking, reblogging, and replying are public
actions – anyone can expand the “notes” view on a post, for example, to see
who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. [CLS] [SEP] we use information about native
actions to improve the services, develop new services, and, particularly, to
personalize your tumblr experience. [CLS] [SEP] personalization using this information may
include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked, providing
you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to
your interests. [CLS] [SEP]

reblogs, likes, and replies are a matter of public record, so if you're truly
ashamed of your desires it's best to keep them to yourself. [CLS] [SEP] but why? be proud
of who you are. [CLS] [SEP] you're beautiful. [CLS] [SEP] we're looking you in the eyes and telling
you how beautiful you are. [CLS] [SEP]

**information about user content:** in some cases, we may collect information
about content you provide to the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when it's included as
part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera
settings, or [exif
information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exchangeable_image_file_format). [CLS] [SEP]
this information allows us to improve the services and provide additional
features and functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

**financial information:** we will sometimes collect financial information,
such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number,
type, expiration date or other financial information). [CLS] [SEP] this happens when you
decide to purchase a paid service. [CLS] [SEP] we do not, however, store that financial
information; such information is stored by our payment processor (the "
**payment processor** "), and use and storage of that information is governed
by the payment processor’s applicable [terms of
service](http://www.authorize.net/company/terms/) and [privacy
policy](http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/) (the payment processor may
also have other terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing
yourself with those terms, as applicable). [CLS] [SEP] we do receive certain information
from our payment processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your
account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored
by our payment processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the
credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent
fraudulent transactions and identity theft. [CLS] [SEP]

**information related to use of the services:** we collect information about
how people use the services, including those with an account. [CLS] [SEP] this type of
information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with
(i.e., make a request to) the services. [CLS] [SEP] we use internal tools and third party
applications and services (like google analytics or comscore) to collect and
analyze this information. [CLS] [SEP] some of this information may also be associated with
the internet protocol address (“ **ip address** ”) used to access the
services; some may be connected with your account; and some may only be
collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn’t
identify you or your account). [CLS] [SEP] we also collect your ip address when you make a
post, particularly when you submit an anonymous “ask.” we may use this
information about how you and others interact with the services for a number
of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and
developing new services, including but not limited to: providing users with
personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our
search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam,
malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe;
and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in “information disclosed for
our protection and the protection of others.”

we use information about how you interact with tumblr in order to personalize
it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve
tumblr for everyone who uses it. [CLS] [SEP]

**information related to your web browser:** we automatically receive and
record information from your web browser when you interact with the services,
such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your
operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service
that referred you to the services, the date and time of each request you make
to the services, your screen display information, and information from any
cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). [CLS] [SEP] we also
sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and
store that information in a manner associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP] we use web
browser-related information to enhance and improve the services. [CLS] [SEP]

**location information:** in some cases we collect and store information about
where you are located, such as by converting your ip address into a rough
geolocation. [CLS] [SEP] we may also ask you to provide information about your location,
for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to
geotag a post. [CLS] [SEP] we may use location information to improve and personalize the
services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content. [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video
feeds. [CLS] [SEP] ha ha, no, we just check out your [ip
address](http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/navigatingthenet/f/ip-addresses-
explained.htm) or any location data you attach to a post. [CLS] [SEP] normal stuff. [CLS] [SEP]

**information related to your mobile device:** we may collect and store
information related to your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may receive,
generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes
described above in “information related to use of the services.” we may also
ask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the
services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for account login. [CLS] [SEP]
we will always ask you whether it’s ok for us to collect and store your phone
number. [CLS] [SEP]

**information collected using cookies and web tags:** cookies are text files
that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website;
your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website
you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser
settings, depending on what browser you’re using. [CLS] [SEP] a web tag is code or a pixel
embedded in a web page, or email, that allows tumblr or a third party to see
that you have looked at that page. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies and web tags to enable our
servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the
services, as described above in “information related to use of the services.”
our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally
identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through
cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do use
cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has
accessed the services, and we may associate that information with your account
if you have one. [CLS] [SEP] we may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we
associate with your account in our cookies. [CLS] [SEP] this information, in turn, is
sometimes used as described above in “information related to use of the
services.” most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie
feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well
as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to
decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. [CLS] [SEP] if you disable
cookies, you won't be able to log into your account, and so won’t be able to
use the vast majority of our services; as such, we don't recommend disabling
your cookies when using the services. [CLS] [SEP] some services that we use (including
third party services), such as [google
analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and comscore, use web tags
and may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on
our network may contain code that places their own cookies. [CLS] [SEP] for more
information about google analytics, click
[here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners), and for comscore,
click [here](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx?newlanguage=1). [CLS] [SEP] we
also run limited-time studies using web tags, sometimes with third parties,
to, for example, measure the effectiveness of our advertising or email. [CLS] [SEP] note
that, unless otherwise disclosed, this privacy policy covers _our_ use of
cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

being able to log into your account is one of tumblr's many great features. [CLS] [SEP]
cookies make this possible. [CLS] [SEP] cookies and web tags also let us learn how people
use tumblr, which in turn helps us make a better product for you to use. [CLS] [SEP]

**information about your contacts:** certain features of the services allow
you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with
people in our services that are also on those contact lists. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you
can temporarily connect your email contact information to your account, so
that we can provide you with a list of your email contacts that use the
services. [CLS] [SEP] as another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact
information through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide
you with a list of those contacts that use the services so that you can
“follow” their blogs. [CLS] [SEP] we will give you a choice as to whether or not you
provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the
appropriate feature, how we use that information. [CLS] [SEP]

we won't look at (or be able to look at) your contact list unless you ask us
to. [CLS] [SEP] why would you ask us to? because that's how you would find out if any of
your contacts are on tumblr. [CLS] [SEP] we discard this information immediately
afterward. [CLS] [SEP]

**derived information:** as described above in “native actions” and
“information related to use of the services,” we analyze your actions on the
services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive
of your account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of
posts you view, like, or reblog). [CLS] [SEP] we use this information for all of the
purposes set forth in “information related to use of the services,” above. [CLS] [SEP]

## personalized advertising on tumblr

in order to provide you with all of this tumblr content for free, tumblr
selectively runs advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] we, and our parent company, automattic, work
with online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as
relevant and useful as possible. [CLS] [SEP] to make our ads more relevant and useful, we
make educated guesses about your interests based on your activity on our sites
and services. [CLS] [SEP] the ads we show you often reflect these interests and educated
guesses. [CLS] [SEP]

to learn more about how we select the ads you see, you can check out [
tumblr’s advertising](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360035272334-tumblr-ads-you) and affiliate policies. [CLS] [SEP]

**managing your choices for personalized advertising experiences** : if you do
not prefer personalized advertising experiences, you may opt-out. [CLS] [SEP] note that if
you opt-out you will continue to see advertisements on tumblr, though they
will be less relevant and useful to you. [CLS] [SEP]

when using web-based versions of tumblr, you may opt-out of interest-based or
personalized advertising by using the following industry opt-out pages:

  * (eu) european interactive digital advertising alliance (edaa) - [www.youronlinechoices.com](www.youronlinechoices.com)
  * (us) network advertising initiative (nai) - [www.networkadvertising.org](www.networkadvertising.org)
  * (us) digital advertising alliance (daa) - [www.aboutads.info](www.aboutads.info)
  * (japan) data driven advertising initiative (ddai) - [www.ddai.info](www.ddai.info)

these industry advertising organizations offer web browser-based tools for
limiting the use of your web viewing data for interest-based or personalized
advertising. [CLS] [SEP] any choices made via these industry tools will only apply to the
web browser in use for the choices made. [CLS] [SEP] these advertising choices are not
propagated among all of your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

when using the mobile app version of tumblr on apple ios devices you can opt
out of personalized advertising by selecting "limit ad tracking" in the ios
settings. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about these ios options:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] open settings;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] select privacy; and
  3. [CLS] [SEP] select advertising and follow the on-screen instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

when using the mobile app version of tumblr on android devices you can opt-out
of personalized advertising by selecting "opt out of interest based ads" in
google settings. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about these android options:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] open settings;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] select google;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] select privacy; and
  4. [CLS] [SEP] select ads and follow the on-screen instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

## with whom your information is shared

we never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your
permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that
the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this privacy
policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information
that does not identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

**information shared with and received from our corporate parents:** we are a
wholly-owned subsidiary of automattic, and a member of the automattic family
of companies. [CLS] [SEP] because we are a wholly-owned subsidiary, automattic and the
rest of our family of companies may receive any information we do, and may
share information they have with us. [CLS] [SEP] our family of companies may use the
information they receive from us to help us provide, understand, and improve
the services (including by providing us analytics) and in connection with
their products and services (including by providing you with a more
personalized experience). [CLS] [SEP] for details about how automattic treats the
information it collects, please review this [privacy
policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/). [CLS] [SEP]

automattic owns us and we share with it and the automattic family of
companies. [CLS] [SEP]

**information shared with the public through the services:** as noted in “user
content” and “native actions,” above, by default, content published through
the services and many actions you take on the services are shared with the
public. [CLS] [SEP] because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be
indexed by search engines, you should be careful about what you choose to
disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with
everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

the content you create on tumblr is, by default, public. [CLS] [SEP] this means that
anyone can see it, and that search engines can index it. [CLS] [SEP] if these things
bother you, take a look at some of the additional [ privacy
features](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/115011611747-privacy-options)
we offer. [CLS] [SEP]

**information shared between the services:** we may, if possible, aggregate
information about your use of multiple services and use that consolidated
information to enhance and improve the services, and to develop new services. [CLS] [SEP]

**information you share with third party services:** you may access third
party services through the services, for example by clicking on externally-
pointing links. [CLS] [SEP] you may also choose to share information that you provide to
us, like blog posts, with those third party services (for example, by sharing
posts to twitter or facebook). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy only governs information we
collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those third
party services' privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

you can automatically publish the posts you make on tumblr to other sites
(like facebook or twitter). [CLS] [SEP] that's where our privacy policy ends and their
policies begin. [CLS] [SEP] make sure you're cool with the policies of any services you're
considering sharing to before connecting them to your tumblr account. [CLS] [SEP]

**information shared with our agents in order to operate and improve the
services:** in some cases, we share information we store (such as ip
addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and
other agents (" **agents** "), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and
improving the services, and developing new products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
we may share information with service providers that help us fight spam,
payment providers that process your credit and debit card information,
customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you
(hey there!), analytics providers that help us understand and improve our
services, and third party partners that pitch in on our marketing efforts
(like identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing
campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services), along with third-party
consultants who may have access to information in the process of improving our
processes and technology. [CLS] [SEP] agents with whom we share such information for these
reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell
you differently, our agents do not have any right to use information we share
with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. [CLS] [SEP]

**information disclosed pursuant to business transfers:** in some cases, we
may choose to buy or sell business assets. [CLS] [SEP] in these transactions, user
information is typically one of the transferred business assets. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, if
we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of
business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
is transferred or acquired by a third party. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that such
transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to
use your personal information as set forth in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

should we happen to get acquired (again!) or go out of business (no way), the
transfer of assets from us to our buyer may very well include user
information. [CLS] [SEP] they are allowed to use it only in the ways outlined here, in the
privacy policy you are reading right now. [CLS] [SEP]

**information disclosed for our protection and the protection of others:** we
believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to
protect our community from baseless legal demands. [CLS] [SEP] that said, we also reserve
the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably
believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law,
regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii)
enforce this privacy policy and our [terms of service](/policy/terms-of-
service/automattic), including investigation of potential violations hereof,
(iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety,
or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud,
spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the
rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the
public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible
violence, suicide, or self-harm. [CLS] [SEP]

don’t make us narc on you. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t want to. [CLS] [SEP] but we do need to protect
everyone who uses tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves. [CLS] [SEP] we work
hard to balance privacy and community, and we’re sure you can appreciate the
challenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges. [CLS] [SEP]

**information we share with your consent or at your request:** if you ask us
to release information that we have about your account, we will do so if
reasonable and not unduly burdensome. [CLS] [SEP]

**information shared with other third parties:** we may share or disclose non-
private information, aggregate information, or other non-personally
identifying information with people and entities that we do business with. [CLS] [SEP]

## security and retention of your information

your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and
security. [CLS] [SEP] we may enable additional security features in the future, like
multi-factor authentication. [CLS] [SEP] you need to prevent unauthorized access to your
account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password
and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have
finished accessing your account on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

we seek to protect your information (including your account information) to
ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of
any information. [CLS] [SEP] unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and
other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

it’s really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts
on the internet, including your tumblr account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have trouble
remembering passwords then you might consider using a service like
[1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) or
[lastpass](https://lastpass.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

tumblr will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the
purposes set out in this privacy policy, for as long as your tumblr account is
active or as needed to provide you with the services. [CLS] [SEP] please note that this
applies to information in tumblr group chats as well. [CLS] [SEP] even though tumblr only
makes group chat messages available to the public (i.e., the other chat
participants) for a short amount of time before their expiration and deletion
from public view, group chat messages and related information (e.g., list of
chat participants) will be retained by tumblr for internal purpose (e.g.,
security audits), and/or as required by law (e.g., pursuant to a litigation
hold notice) after they have disappeared from public view. [CLS] [SEP] if you no longer
want tumblr to use your information to provide you with the services, you may
close your account and tumblr will delete the information it holds about you
unless we need to retain and use your information to comply with our legal
obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise
permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

## what information you can access

if you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with
your account by logging into the services and checking your account settings
page. [CLS] [SEP] registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through
their web browser settings. [CLS] [SEP]

## how to delete your account and what happens when you delete your account

if you want to delete your account, you can do so from your [account
settings](/settings/account). [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account may not fully remove the
content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies
of, or references to your account information may not be immediately removed. [CLS] [SEP]
in addition, given the nature of sharing on the services, some of the public
activity on your account prior to deletion (such as reblogs of your blog
posts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public. [CLS] [SEP]

you'll do great things on tumblr, surely, but if it ever comes time to say
goodbye, then you're free to delete your account at any time and for any
reason. [CLS] [SEP] the deletion will be effective immediately, for the most part, but it
might take a little while to scrub everything from our archives and backups. [CLS] [SEP]

what won't get scrubbed are reblogs of your posts. [CLS] [SEP] those will remain on
whatever blog reblogged them. [CLS] [SEP] like we said before, it can be really, really
hard to delete something once it goes out onto the internet, so be sure you're
only publishing stuff that you're certain you want to publish. [CLS] [SEP]

## california users

## supplemental privacy notice for california residents

the notice supplements the information in our privacy policy above for
california residents. [CLS] [SEP]

### summary of information we collect

if you're a california resident, california law requires us to provide you
with some additional information about how we collect, use, and disclose your
"personal information," as defined in the california consumer privacy act
("ccpa"). [CLS] [SEP]

throughout our privacy policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal
information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we share it. [CLS] [SEP]
under the ccpa, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal
information we collect and disclose for "business purposes" (as those terms
are defined by applicable law). [CLS] [SEP] those categories are identifiers (such as
username and email address); commercial information (such as transaction
data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account
information); internet or other network or device activity (such as unique
identifiers, browsing history or other usage data); geolocation information
(general location); inference data about you; legally protected
classifications (such as gender); physical characteristics or description
(such as when you voluntarily submit a photo); or other information that
identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. [CLS] [SEP]

we use these categories of personal information consistent with the various
business and commercial purposes we describe in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] check out
[“what we collect and how we use it”](/privacy/en#what-we-collect) to learn
more. [CLS] [SEP] we share this information with the categories of third parties described
above in [“with whom your information is shared."](/privacy/en#with-whom-your-
information-is-shared)

we may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP] we may aggregate the information we collect
or de-identify it in order to limit or prevent the identification of any
particular user or device. [CLS] [SEP]

### california privacy rights

if you're a california resident, the ccpa provides you with rights regarding
your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**access:** the ccpa gives you the right to request a copy of certain
information we hold about you, as well as a summary of: the categories of
personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last
twelve months, the categories of sources of such information, the business or
commercial purpose for collecting or sharing that information, and the
categories of third parties with whom we shared that information. [CLS] [SEP] as described
in the section ‘what information you can access,’ you can access much of your
information by logging in to your tumblr account. [CLS] [SEP] you can also request a
personal data report by submitting a request in the privacy section of your
settings. [CLS] [SEP] you need to be signed in to your tumblr account to submit this
request, and you will have to log in to your account to access the summary or
the report. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to request the summary described above, require
additional assistance, or if you do not have a tumblr account, submit a
support ticket [here](/support) or email us at ccpa@tumblr.com. [CLS] [SEP]

**delete:** the ccpa also gives you the right to delete certain information we
have about you. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete much of your information by logging in to your
account. [CLS] [SEP] if you cannot do this, or you do not have a tumblr account, please
submit a support ticket [here](/support), or email us at ccpa@tumblr.com. [CLS] [SEP] for
more information on deleting your account or leaving tumblr, please refer to
the section ‘how to delete your account.’

**financial incentives:** you may have the right to receive information about
the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). [CLS] [SEP]

**consequences of exercising rights:** you also have the right not to be
discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

certain information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide you with
the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you ask us to delete them, you may no longer be able to
access or use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

before we can satisfy your request, you'll need to give us enough information
so that we can be certain of your identity. [CLS] [SEP] to do that, you'll need to log in
to your account or give us certain information about you and/or your use of
the services. [CLS] [SEP] you can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on
your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] to do so, you have to give us written authorization for the agent
to act on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] you'll still need to verify your identity directly with
us. [CLS] [SEP]

**personalized advertising opt-out:** tumblr selectively runs advertisements
so we can provide you with tumblr content for free. [CLS] [SEP] to help select which ads
to show you, we may share some of your information with advertising partners,
or allow our advertising partners to “collect” certain information. [CLS] [SEP] the
personal information we share includes online identifiers and internet or
other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device
identifiers, and ip address), and geolocation data (approximate location
information from your ip address). [CLS] [SEP] under the ccpa, this may be considered a
“sale.” to learn more about how we select the ads you see, check out [tumblr’s
advertising and affiliate
policies](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360035272334-tumblr-ads-you). [CLS] [SEP]
we do not sell (or share) information that identifies you personally, like
your name or contact information, in our ads program. [CLS] [SEP] also, we do not
knowingly "sell" your personal information if you are under 16. [CLS] [SEP]

learn how you can opt out by going to [california: do not sell my personal
information](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041012973). [CLS] [SEP] if
you are a california user who has told us you are under 16, you’ll see in
[your settings](/settings/privacy) that we’ve already opted you out. [CLS] [SEP]
