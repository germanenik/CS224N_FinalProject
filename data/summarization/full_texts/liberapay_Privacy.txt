we do our best to protect everyone's privacy: we do not attempt to track
people who visit our website, we strive to collect only the personal
information we actually need, and we don't sell it to anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies

the liberapay.com website only sets technical cookies which are required to
authenticate the user or to perform a specific operation. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies are
restricted to same-site requests, so we don't know who visits websites that
contain liberapay widgets. [CLS] [SEP]

visitors of the liberapay.com website can also receive cookies sent by
cloudflare. [CLS] [SEP] please read [“understanding the cloudflare
cookies”](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156) if you
want to learn more about them. [CLS] [SEP]

on some payment pages, extra cookies may be set by the payment processor. [CLS] [SEP]
please read these documents if you want more information: [stripe's cookie
policy](https://stripe.com/cookies-policy/legal) and [paypal's cookie
policy](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full). [CLS] [SEP]

### social networks

liberapay currently has integrations with github, twitter, mastodon, google,
gitlab, youtube, facebook, twitch, openstreetmap, bitbucket, linuxfr.org, and
pleroma. [CLS] [SEP] when an account from one of those platforms is connected to a
liberapay profile, we retrieve and store some data from that platform, for
example the unique identifier of the linked account. [CLS] [SEP] we only keep public
information about the linked account, no private data. [CLS] [SEP]

the primary purpose of these integrations is to confirm that a liberapay
account hasn't been created by an impostor attempting to profit from someone's
else work. [CLS] [SEP]

the second purpose is to help patrons find the liberapay accounts of the
creators they follow on other platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

### payment processors

the intermediaries involved in payment processing collect information for
anti-fraud purposes, for example the name and ip address of the payer. [CLS] [SEP] please
read these documents if you want more information: [stripe's privacy
policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) and [paypal's privacy
policy](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full). [CLS] [SEP]

### personal information leaks

liberapay does not tell creators who their patrons are. [CLS] [SEP] however, paypal allows
the recipient of a payment to see the name and email address of the payer, so
donors who don't want to reveal themselves should not choose paypal as the
payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, paypal allows a donor to see the name and email address of the
recipient, and stripe may expose the recipient's phone number, so creators who
do not want to reveal their identities should not use these payment
processors, unless they have carefully configured their accounts to only leak
nonsensitive information (a business name instead of the creator's name, a
dedicated email address and phone number instead of the creator's personal
contact details). [CLS] [SEP]

### encryption

all network connections are encrypted, except for some communications between
machines located in the same datacenter. [CLS] [SEP]

as a precaution against identity theft in case of data leak, the identity
information of liberapay account owners is stored encrypted in our database. [CLS] [SEP]
