### how we share information

destruction. [CLS] [SEP]

you may delete your account information at any time by logging into your

certain information about you as required by law. [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account will
begin the process of removing your data from the adventurerâs codex system. [CLS] [SEP]
due to the nature of our system, fully removing all your personal data from
our system can take up to 10 days, though your account will be inactive and
unusable immediately after cancellation. [CLS] [SEP]

usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party
cookies. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this
could affect the availability and functionality of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

##### third-party advertising and analytics

some analytics providers may provide specific opt-out mechanisms (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] google
analytics opt-out), and we will provide, as needed, additional tools and
third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you
can opt-out. [CLS] [SEP] you have the ability to opt out of having your web browsing
information used for behavioral advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
