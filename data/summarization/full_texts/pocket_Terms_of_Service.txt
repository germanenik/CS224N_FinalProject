provided solely for your personal, noncommercial use. [CLS] [SEP] the videos, articles and
other content that you choose to save may be protected by copyright and other
laws. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to the website you were visiting when you saved such
content for copyright notices, information and restrictions that may be
applicable to such content. [CLS] [SEP]

we respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the

the pocket technologies, you agree not to use the pocket technologies to
infringe any intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right, at any time,

things, provides paid subscribers with certain features that are not made
available to users of the standard, free version of the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP]
each paid subscriber has a separate, personal library in which an archival
copy of saved content is stored for that subscriber’s own personal non-
commercial use at a later time. [CLS] [SEP] the pocket premium subscription service also
includes other features, such as full-text searching of saved content and

information we collect and what might happen to that information, including,
without limitation, how such information is shared and used. [CLS] [SEP] although our

obligations, it contains information that you should review prior to using the
pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] our privacy policy will apply to the information we
collect, whether or not you choose to read it. [CLS] [SEP] you are not required to create
a user account or provide any personal information in order to visit our

registration data at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if any registration data that you provide is
untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we retain the right, in our
sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your user account and your access to
the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to create a user account, you are responsible for maintaining
the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to
your account. [CLS] [SEP] you may not share your password or other account access
information with any other party, temporarily or permanently, and you agree to
accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or
password, whether or not authorized by you. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to immediately notify us
of any unauthorized use of your account, registration data or passwords, as
the case may be. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to refuse service and/or terminate user
accounts in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to send us any message, feedback or data, including, but not
limited to, any ideas, comments, suggestions or questions regarding any
product or service, such information shall be deemed to be non-confidential. [CLS] [SEP]
we shall have no obligation of any kind with respect to such information and
shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute the information to
others without limitation. [CLS] [SEP] further, we shall be free to use any ideas,
concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such information for any purpose
whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and

responsible for all information which you share, save, submit, publish,
display, disseminate or otherwise communicate through the pocket technologies,
even if a claim should arise after termination of service. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that all
such content, messages and other communications shall not be deemed to be
private or secure, and that any such content, messages and communications can
be read by the operators and/or other agents of mozilla, whether or not they
are the intended recipients. [CLS] [SEP] if we or any other person asks you to cease and
desist from sharing any videos, articles or other content with any third
party, or to cease communicating with any third party via the pocket
technologies, you agree to comply with such request immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

the content, products and services available via the pocket technologies
include materials from non-affiliated third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we also participate in
joint marketing and other service offerings with third parties and our website
contains links to third-party sites. [CLS] [SEP] the pocket technologies also integrate,

enable you to save to pocket within such third-party applications and to
utilize the information we collect to improve the service offerings by such
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] such third parties may provide you with an opportunity to
install the pocket application or use the pocket technologies from or through
their websites or such third parties may request to access or use your pocket

they provide to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you are on a third-party website, you may

respective parties. [CLS] [SEP]

##### disclaimer of warranties

reasonable efforts are taken to improve the accuracy and integrity of the
pocket technologies, but we are not responsible for mistakes, out-of-date
information, inaccuracies, typographical or other errors. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding any
other provision of this agreement, we reserve the right to change, suspend,
remove, or disable access to any of the pocket technologies, content, or other
materials comprising a part of the pocket technologies at any time without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] in no event will we be liable for making these changes. [CLS] [SEP] as a
registered user in good standing, you may be provided with limited access to
the videos, articles or other content saved to pocket. [CLS] [SEP] such access is provided
as an accommodation only, and the items you save with pocket may be deleted at
any time and for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] we do not warrant, and will not have any
liability or responsibility for, your use of pocket or the products or
services we provide. [CLS] [SEP] we may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain features or portions of the pocket technologies, for any reason and
without notice or liability. [CLS] [SEP] our website, products and services may be
unavailable from time to time due to mechanical, telecommunication, software,
and other failures. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot predict or control when such downtime may occur
and cannot control the duration of such downtime. [CLS] [SEP]

 **the pocket technologies (including, without limitation, our application,
software, products, services and website) are provided "as is" and with all
faults. [CLS] [SEP] we make no representation or warranty whatsoever regarding the
completeness, accuracy, adequacy, suitability, functionality, availability, or
operation of the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that we do not have
control over your use of the pocket technologies, and we do not warrant the
performance or results that may be obtained through your use of the pocket
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] you assume all risks and responsibility for your use of the
pocket technologies and for any loss of or errors in any data or information. [CLS] [SEP]
to the full extent permissible by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties,
express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement, and
any warranties arising through course of dealing or usage of trade. [CLS] [SEP] without
limiting the foregoing, we neither warrant nor represent that your use of the
pocket technologies will not infringe the rights of any third parties, nor
that the pocket technologies will be available for your access or use, nor
that operation of the pocket technologies will be error free or uninterrupted. [CLS] [SEP]
please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.**

##### limitation of liability

 **there are inherent risks in relying upon, using, or retrieving any
information found on the internet, and we urge you to make sure you understand
these risks before using the pocket technologies or any website that provides
you with access to the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the pocket
technologies is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] neither mozilla nor any of its parents,
subsidiaries or affiliates, nor any of their employees, officers or directors,
shall be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special,
consequential, or other damages (including, without limitation, loss of data
or information of any kind, loss of business, lost profits, interruption of
business, cost of cover or any other damages) arising out of or in any way
related to this agreement or the use or inability to use the pocket
technologies, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise,
even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain damages, so
some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.**

##### indemnification

you agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
mozilla, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers,
directors, employees, agents, distributors and licensees, from and against any
judgments, losses, deficiencies, damages, liabilities, costs, claims, demands,
suits, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’
fees, expert witness fees and expenses) incurred in, arising out of or in any
way related to your breach of this agreement, your use of the pocket
technologies, or any of your other acts or omissions. [CLS] [SEP]

##### disputes

 **any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of
any of the pocket technologies, including without limitation any disputes
related to the pocket premium subscription service, will be resolved by
binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims
in small claims court if your claims qualify. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act and
federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.**

 **there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
arbitration award is limited. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator, however, may award on an
individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, without
limitation, injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must
follow these terms of service as a court would. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration is more informal
than a lawsuit in court, and allows for more limited discovery than in court. [CLS] [SEP]
the arbitrator will decide all issues, including, without limitation, issues
relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.**

to initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
arbitration and describing your claim to: president, mozilla
corporation/pocket business unit, 2 harrison street, suite 175, san francisco,
ca 94105. [CLS] [SEP] unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration will take place
in the county (or parish) where you live. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be conducted by
jams in accordance with that organization’s "streamlined arbitration rules &
procedures" if jams has an office in the county (or parish) where the
arbitration takes place. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a
neutral arbitrator in accordance with the american arbitration association
(aaa) rules, including the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer-related
disputes. [CLS] [SEP] jams rules and other information are available at
https://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 800.352.5267. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa’s rules and other
information are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP] payment
of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
applicable jams or aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] we will promptly reimburse you for your payment
of the filing fees, unless your claim is for greater than us$10,000, in which
event you will be responsible for filing fees. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim is for us$10,000
or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the
applicable jams or aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall have the discretion to
award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including the cost of the
arbitration and of experts) to the prevailing party, but we will only seek
such fees if the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]

 **we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
action. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.**

##### governing law

by using any of the pocket technologies, you agree that the federal
arbitration act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of
california, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern
these terms of service and any dispute of any kind that might arise between
you and us. [CLS] [SEP]

yearly subscription plans. [CLS] [SEP] each paid subscription is valid for only one user
account and you are not permitted to use your paid subscription with any other
user accounts. [CLS] [SEP] **your paid pocket premium subscription will be automatically
renewed, and the subscription fee charged, at the end of each subscription
period until you cancel. [CLS] [SEP] the subscription fee will be charged to your last
payment method.** we may offer a free trial period for pocket premium. [CLS] [SEP] if you
sign up for a free trial, you will be charged the subscription fee when the
free trial period ends, and at the end of each subsequent subscription period
until you cancel. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not issue refunds for subscriptions paid for through itunes or google
play. [CLS] [SEP] if you pay for your paid subscription through our website, we may, at
our sole discretion, provide a pro-rata refund for the unused portion of the
subscription period. [CLS] [SEP]

you may cancel your subscription at any time. [CLS] [SEP] **if you cancel or decide not to
renew, you will be downgraded to our free service upon cancellation or at the

paid subscription on time, we reserve the right to suspend your paid

agreement. [CLS] [SEP] upon any termination of this agreement, you must promptly destroy
all materials downloaded or otherwise obtained from us, as well as all copies
of such materials. [CLS] [SEP] termination of this agreement shall not act as a waiver of

breach of your obligations under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

upon the termination of a paid subscription, any of the data stored as part of

are appropriate for use or access in other locations. [CLS] [SEP] if you access and use
the pocket technologies outside the united states, you do so on your own
initiative and you are responsible for complying with united states and your
local laws and regulations, if and to the extent such laws are applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not use, export, re-export, import or transfer the pocket technologies
except as authorized by united states law, the laws of the jurisdiction in
which you obtained the pocket technologies, and any other applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] in

##### access by children

in the united states, if you are a device manufacturer or other third party
(the "sponsor") that provides devices to children under the age of 13 that
utilize the pocket technologies, you assume the responsibility for complying
with the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] children’s online privacy protection act ("coppa") and, to the
extent applicable, the family educational rights and privacy act ("ferpa"). [CLS] [SEP]
this means that the sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information
to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and
sharing with the pocket application the personal information of children under
the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP]
schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of
parents/guardians. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on complying with coppa, see the
federal trade commission’s website at
http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm. [CLS] [SEP]

except as provided in the paragraph above, the pocket technologies are not for
individuals under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] if you are 13 or older but under the age of
18, you should review this agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure
that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to it. [CLS] [SEP]

##### electronic communications

if you create a user account or send emails to us, you consent to receive
communications from us electronically. [CLS] [SEP] we will communicate with you by email
or by posting notices on the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that all
agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to
you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be
in writing. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we may send email to you for the purpose of
advising you of changes or additions to the pocket technologies or your pocket

we will post the modification on our website, through the pocket technologies,
or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. [CLS] [SEP] prior to each usage
of the pocket technologies, you should review the terms of service to
determine the current agreement to which you are bound. [CLS] [SEP] for your convenience,
we include the effective date of the agreement at the beginning of the
document, so that you can easily ascertain whether it has been updated since
the last time you viewed the terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the
pocket technologies constitutes acceptance of this agreement at the time of
each use. [CLS] [SEP] if the modified terms of service are not acceptable to you, your
only recourse is to cease using the pocket technologies. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the
preceding sentences of this paragraph, no revisions to the terms of service
will apply to any dispute between you and pocket that arose prior to the date
