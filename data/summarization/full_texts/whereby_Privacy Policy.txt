## how we process media (audio/video)

we will never store any media sent between participants in a room. [CLS] [SEP] customers
who have access to the “recording” feature will be able to record meetings,
and they are then responsible for collecting consents from all participants in
the meeting prior to starting the recording. [CLS] [SEP] they are also responsible for
storing and processing the recording in compliance with regulations after
downloading it from whereby. [CLS] [SEP]

### security

in the free version of the service, users can use “small meeting” mode (up to
4 participants). [CLS] [SEP] in “small meeting” mode, communication between participants
are primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections, where audio and video
streams are sent directly between participants and do not pass through any of
our servers. [CLS] [SEP] video and audio transmitted in the service is then sent directly
between the participants in a room and is encrypted (dtls-srtp) with client-
generated encryption keys. [CLS] [SEP] in cases where a user is behind a strict firewall
or nat, video and audio need to be relayed via a turn server, but end-to-end
encryption is still maintained. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have upgraded a room to pro, you can choose to use “large meeting” mode
(up to 12 participants). [CLS] [SEP] calls using “large meeting” mode will use a dedicated
server infrastructure to allow more people in conversation, and better
stability. [CLS] [SEP] your stream will be sent through video router servers which
transmits it to the other participants in the call, and also transmits their
streams to you. [CLS] [SEP] streams will always be encrypted (dtls-srtp) in transit, but
will be decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video routers. [CLS] [SEP] we
operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed across the world, and
you will be automatically routed to the closest one. [CLS] [SEP] the video router servers
and all of our infrastructure adhere to strict security measures, preventing
any eavesdropping or interruption of the video/audio streams. [CLS] [SEP]

## providing your personal data to others

including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who

researchers, with aggregation, anonymization; (4) when we have a good faith
belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal
process; (5) to protect the vital interest of others, when we have reason to
believe that doing so will prevent harm to someone or illegal activities. [CLS] [SEP]
