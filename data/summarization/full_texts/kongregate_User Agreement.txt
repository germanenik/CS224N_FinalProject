please read these terms of service carefully before using our services. [CLS] [SEP] these
terms of service govern your access and use of the services (as defined below)
provided or made available by or on behalf of kongregate inc. [CLS] [SEP] (and together
with our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, when applicable) ( **"
kongregate,"** **" we"** or **" us"**). [CLS] [SEP]

you are using our services if you are using, accessing, downloading, playing
and/or purchasing games or in-game purchases by way of:

  * websites owned or operated by or on behalf of kongregate (e.g., [www.kongregate.com](https://www.kongregate.com/), [www.kartridge.com](https://www.kartridge.com/)) that is accessible through various desktop and mobile web browsers (each, a **" site,"** and collectively, the **" sites"**)

  * mobile applications published, distributed, owned or operated by or on behalf of kongregate (each, an **" app,"** and collectively, the **" apps,"** and together with the sites, our **" platform"**); or

  * third party platforms, e.g., via consoles, pcs and/or social networking sites such ( **" 3rd party platforms"**); or 

  * if you are otherwise accessing any of our other products, services or content through our platform or a 3rd party platform (collectively, our **" services"**). [CLS] [SEP]

when using our services, you agree to, and accept, these terms of service,
which we may update from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] your use of our services is also
subject to our [privacy
policy](javascript:util.openurl\('https://www.kongregate.com/pages/privacy?external-
link=true'\)) and our [cookie
policy](javascript:util.openurl\('https://www.kongregate.com/pages/cookie-
policy?external-link=true'\)), which are each incorporated by reference in
their entirety into these terms of service (collectively, the "terms"). [CLS] [SEP] these
terms form a legally binding agreement between you and kongregate, so please
read them carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to the agreement and severability

we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove
portions of the terms at any time by posting the amended terms on our platform
or within our services (such as through in-game notices). [CLS] [SEP] the changes are
effective immediately upon posting. [CLS] [SEP] you may contact us at
[support@kongregate.com](javascript:util.openurl\('mailto:support@kongregate.com'\))
if you have specific questions regarding the changes. [CLS] [SEP] unless we state
otherwise, each time you access our services, the platform or 3rd party
platform games, the then current version of the agreement applies, and you
agree that the changes apply to your continued use of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

your failure to cancel your account, or cease use of our services, after
receiving notification of the amended agreement, will constitute your
acceptance of the amended terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the amendments or to
any of the terms in these terms, you always have the option to terminate your
account or cease use of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

if any portion of these terms is deemed to be illegal or unenforceable, the
remainder of the agreement shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully
valid, binding, and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] who can use our services

our services are designed for and directed at people 18 years of age or older. [CLS] [SEP]
to use our services or become a **" user"** (as defined below), you affirm
that: (a) you can enter into a binding contract with kongregate and that you
are not a child (as defined below) or (b) you have reviewed these terms with
your parent or guardian who agrees to these terms on your behalf and takes
full responsibility for your compliance with them. [CLS] [SEP] you represent that you are
fully able and competent to enter into these terms and you agree to abide and
comply with them. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under the age of majority where you are located,
you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to
these terms on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

**" child"** or **" children"** means anyone under the age of 13 (or under 16
in certain european countries). [CLS] [SEP] with the exception of a few youth-appealing
games, children should not attempt to create an account or send any
information to us without a parent or guardian’s consent. [CLS] [SEP] creating an account
with false information is a violation of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we will not knowingly
collect personal information from children as further provided in our [privacy
policy](javascript:util.openurl\('https://www.kongregate.com/pages/privacy?external-
link=true'\)). [CLS] [SEP]

we also reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, to
discontinue or modify our services or any part thereof, or remove or edit
content (as defined below), without prior notice (although we will endeavor to
give you at least 30 days' notice of material changes) either permanently or
temporarily, at which point your right to use those services or any part
thereof will be automatically terminated or suspended. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] account information and security

in order to use our services, we may ask that you create an account and select
a password and/or provide us with certain personal information, which may
include your email, username, ip address and certain other information. [CLS] [SEP] you
become a user ( **" user"**) by completing the registration of an account to
access our services ( **" account"**). [CLS] [SEP] accounts are not transferable under any
circumstance. [CLS] [SEP] the account information you provide will be used in accordance
with our [privacy
policy](javascript:util.openurl\('https://www.kongregate.com/pages/privacy?external-
link=true'\)). [CLS] [SEP] you agree to provide kongregate with accurate, complete and up-
to-date information, particularly your email address. [CLS] [SEP] kongregate has the right
to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account and refuse any and all current
or future access to our services if we reasonably believe that such
information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete. [CLS] [SEP]

while kongregate takes multiple steps to protect against possible breaches of
our services and the personal data we maintain, no website or internet
transmission is completely secure. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, kongregate cannot, and does not
guarantee, that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will
never occur. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. [CLS] [SEP]
you should not share your account details with others to access or use your
account. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur
under your account, and you understand that you may be held liable for losses
incurred by us or any other use of the services caused by someone else using
your account. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you become aware of loss, theft, fraud or
unauthorized use of your account, please contact us at

immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] billing, payment and virtual items

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **billing** and payment methods and services are provided by one or more third party billing service providers (collectively, the **" billing company"**) and not by kongregate. [CLS] [SEP] by purchasing virtual items (as defined below), you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions imposed by the billing company, including its privacy policy, in addition to the terms of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change the billing company at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **payment.** you must have a valid credit card or other valid payment method accepted by the billing company (collectively, **" payment method"**) and have reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside in order to purchase virtual items and to establish a payment account, which may not be transferred to or used by any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant to kongregate that (i) you are authorized to use the billing payment method for the virtual items (including, without limitation, all accounts, credit cards, direct bank transfers, checks and other payment mechanisms associated therewith) for the purposes of purchasing virtual items as described herein; (ii) the payment method is valid; (iii) all information and data you submit in connection with the purchase of a virtual item and any payment method is complete, true, accurate and up-to-date; (iv) kongregate and the billing company are authorized to and may charge such payment method; (v) you have reached the age of majority in the state in which you reside; and (vi) you are able to form a legally binding contract under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if payment cannot be charged to your payment method or your payment or charge is returned for any reason, including without limitation chargeback, kongregate and the billing company reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the payment account and/or your ability to purchase virtual items without notice. [CLS] [SEP]

as the account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including
applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your
account, including family and friends. [CLS] [SEP] any delinquent or unpaid accounts must
be settled before kongregate will allow you to register again. [CLS] [SEP] kongregate
reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the
cancellation of your account or termination of your access to our services. [CLS] [SEP]
kongregate is expressly relying on your representation that you have reached
the age of majority; kongregate would not enter into this **" billing, payment
and virtual items"** portion of the agreement with you but for the
representation that you have reached the age of majority under the laws of
where you reside. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **prices and taxes.** all prices we show in our services are subject to change without notice. [CLS] [SEP] prices stated at the beginning of delivery apply. [CLS] [SEP] applicable taxes or shipping and handling charges are included in the product prices, but all such charges will be added to your invoice and will be visible at check out before you complete your purchase. [CLS] [SEP] kongregate or the billing company will collect sales tax in the states where we are required by law to do so. [CLS] [SEP] thus we may require you to tell us or the billing company your state of residency when ordering. [CLS] [SEP] applicable sales tax will be included in your purchase price. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] **kreds, in app purchases and other virtual items.** kongregate credits ( **" kreds"**), kongregate plus in-app purchases, games, dlc and any other virtual in game items or services offered through any kongregate platform (collectively, "virtual items") and either earned by you through game play or purchased by you are licensed, not sold, to you on the following terms and conditions:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] effective upon your earning or purchase of a virtual item, subject to these terms, kongregate grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to publicly display on the platform and use the virtual item as authorized by kongregate through our services or under these terms, provided that you comply with the following license conditions. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP] virtual items have no monetary value, are non-refundable and cannot be used to purchase or use products or services other than use in connection with in-game play offered on the site, as determined by kongregate in its discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] you may not distribute or otherwise transfer any virtual item to any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you may not distribute kreds to yourself or to members of your immediate family, even if they are a game developer. [CLS] [SEP] any attempt to distribute, sell or otherwise transfer any virtual item except as expressly authorized under these terms will result in an automatic termination of such license. [CLS] [SEP] further, as the virtual items are merely licensed game play activities, they are deemed consumed upon purchase event. [CLS] [SEP]
    4. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly stated in the terms of these terms, you have no property, proprietary or ownership interest in, or other right or license to, the platform or any virtual item, all of which remain the exclusive property of kongregate or its licensors. [CLS] [SEP]
    5. [CLS] [SEP] the virtual items are protected in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and internationally under trademark, copyright and/or other rights protected by intellectual property laws. [CLS] [SEP] your use of any virtual item outside the scope of the license grant and these license conditions constitutes infringement of such intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]
    6. [CLS] [SEP] software that may be available in connection with our services (the **" software"**) is further subject to united states export controls. [CLS] [SEP] no software may be downloaded from the platform or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export laws. [CLS] [SEP] downloading or using the software is at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP]
    7. [CLS] [SEP] all virtual item purchases are non-refundable and non-returnable except:

      24. [CLS] [SEP] for a game or dlc that is charged to your account within two (2) weeks of such original purchase, _provided that_ the game or dlc has not yet been downloaded, i.e., once you have redeemed dlc, such content is not returnable, exchangeable or refundable;
      25. [CLS] [SEP] for a game or dlc that is misrepresented in the images or descriptions in kartridge or www.kartridge.com;
      26. [CLS] [SEP] in kongregate's sole and absolute discretion or where required by law. [CLS] [SEP] kongregate reserves the right to refuse a refund if we determine that there is abuse of the refund policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] third party sites and advertising
