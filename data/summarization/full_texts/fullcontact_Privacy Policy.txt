# privacy notice for data subjects

this privacy notice (“privacy notice”) is intended for anyone who wishes to
review, modify, restrict or take ownership of the information that fullcontact
might have on them, as well as understand how fullcontact uses that
information. [CLS] [SEP] additional information for fullcontact users can be found in the
[privacy policy](/privacy/privacy-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

## overview

fullcontact's core purpose is to **make relationships better**. [CLS] [SEP] in today's
fast-paced and multi-layered world, keeping up with everyone you know both
online and offline can prove daunting. [CLS] [SEP] discovering, building, and cultivating
authentic relationships with the people that matter most to you, both
personally and professionally, is hard with our data scattered and fragmented
all over the digital world. [CLS] [SEP] most of us also expect the companies that we
interact with to treat us like humans and know who we are as a person, not
cogs in some machine. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes, having the right information at the right
time makes all the difference. [CLS] [SEP]

you can think of fullcontact as the "phone book" for the modern digital world. [CLS] [SEP]
we do our best to bring together contact information from a variety of public
sources (such as is available on the internet through a simple google search)
and combine it with contact information that our users contribute (similar to
wikipedia). [CLS] [SEP] we couple that with powerful tools for individuals and companies
to manage their contacts. [CLS] [SEP]

we aim to have the most complete, accurate, and up-to-date record we can for
each person in our "phone book" (also known as the "fullcontact database"). [CLS] [SEP]
the types of information we may keep track of include contact elements such as
name, address, phone number, email, social profiles, and device ids. [CLS] [SEP] we often
also have professional information (such as organizational affiliations, job
titles, and skills) as well as personal information (such as interests,
relationships, and basic demographic data like age, gender, and location). [CLS] [SEP] in
many cases we may also find associated profile photos. [CLS] [SEP]

all of this information is intended to help the people and companies you
interact with to know you better and be able to develop true and meaningful
relationships with you. [CLS] [SEP] based on the information someone already has on you,
they might look you up in our system and get back some additional information. [CLS] [SEP]

the information in our system also helps the people and companies you interact
with to clean up their own "address books" so that they don't have information
about you scattered across multiple systems and devices and so that they don't
connect with you multiple times, through different channels, with information
that is entirely irrelevant to you. [CLS] [SEP] we help our people and companies to gather
their existing information into clean contact records for each individual they
know. [CLS] [SEP]

we also allow people or companies to search in our system for individuals who
meet certain criteria. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a professional who's trying to find an
expert in their field can use our services to find the right person. [CLS] [SEP]
similarly, an organization could search for the most appropriate audience for
their offerings. [CLS] [SEP]

in all cases, our goal is to help people and companies make better, more
valuable connections. [CLS] [SEP] we recognize, however, that not everyone is comfortable
sharing their contact information with others. [CLS] [SEP] for this reason, anyone can
take ownership of their information in our system at any time here: [own your
personal data.](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim)

actually, we hope that you do choose to take ownership of your information and
help keep our "phone book" as accurate and up-to-date as possible. [CLS] [SEP] it is only
through the contributions of people like you that we can provide this valuable
service to you and everyone else. [CLS] [SEP] our dream is to have everyone owning their
data, fully controlling where it flows, and seeing better relationships in
return. [CLS] [SEP] we may ask in time for your consent to use that data but as of right
now we shall keep our “books open” and you can restrict processing of some
parts or all of your data. [CLS] [SEP] period. [CLS] [SEP] please reach out at any time with any ideas
on how we can serve you better. [CLS] [SEP] [own your personal
data](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim)

## your rights

anyone, in any country across the world, may access, rectify, or restrict
their personal data within fullcontact database at any time by visiting [own
your personal data](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim). [CLS] [SEP] please note that
we may ask you to verify your identity before taking action on your request. [CLS] [SEP]
if you ask us to erase your data, we may still have to retain certain data
about you to ensure that your personal data does not re-enter our system and
protect your rights. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, we will mark your personal data as "hidden"
and "restrict processing" such that your data is no longer used or made
available to anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

### california privacy rights

california’s “shine the light” law, civil code section 1798.83, requires
certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties
for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from
california customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to such
information-sharing. [CLS] [SEP] alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy
not to disclose a customer’s personal information to third parties for the
third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an
option to opt-out of such information-sharing. [CLS] [SEP] we have such a policy in place. [CLS] [SEP]
as described in section 8.2 of the privacy policy, you can opt-out of our
sharing of your personal information with anyone (including with third parties
for the third parties' direct marketing purposes) by clicking on the [“own
your personal data”](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim) in that section
of our privacy policy and choosing to "do not share". [CLS] [SEP] to find out more about
your opt-out rights, please contact us at the address listed in section 11 of
the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] please note that under california law businesses are only
required to respond to a customer making such a request once during any
calendar year. [CLS] [SEP]

### general data protection regulation (gdpr)

individuals in the eu may exercise any of the rights described in this section
by using the applicable functionality in our services or by contacting us
directly. [CLS] [SEP] if you reside outside of the european union, you may have similar
rights under your local laws. [CLS] [SEP]

the purpose for processing, categories of personal data concerned, and
categories of recipients of personal data are described in the "overview"
section above. [CLS] [SEP] our lawful basis for processing is our legitimate interest in
providing contact management services to our users, enabling them to better
connect and build their relationships with you. [CLS] [SEP] personal data will be retained
as long as necessary to serve that purpose or until you decide it is not in
your best interest to keep your information in the fullcontact database. [CLS] [SEP] you
have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have taken ownership of your data by following the necessary steps at
([own your personal data](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim)) or by
contacting us directly, we may ask for your explicit permission to share
certain of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to give permission to share
certain information, then our lawful basis for processing is your consent. [CLS] [SEP] you
have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right
of portability for any data that you have provided us. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure
of personal data or restriction of processing. [CLS] [SEP] you may exercise these rights
at ([own your personal data](https://platform.fullcontact.com/claim)) or by
contacting us directly. [CLS] [SEP] requests for erasure can not be met because erasing
your personal data would not achieve the desired result of your personal data
not being in our system: we receive data continuously and would likely have
your personal data in our system again quickly. [CLS] [SEP] instead, we will mark your
personal data as "hidden" and "restrict processing" such that your data is no
longer used in providing our service and is no longer made available to
anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the right to request the sources of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] you may do so
by contacting us as indicated in the "contact us" section below. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that to protect the rights of other data subjects, we may only be able to
provide you with the general categories of sources. [CLS] [SEP]

we may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of
companies or with service providers based in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] fullcontact
complies with the eu-us privacy shield framework and the swiss-us privacy
shield framework as set forth by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce regarding the
collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the european
union and switzerland to the united states, respectively. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the right to lodge a complaint with your applicable supervising
authority. [CLS] [SEP]

that relates to a group or category of individuals, from which individual
identities have been removed, that is not linked or reasonably linkable to any
individual or household, including via a device. [CLS] [SEP] "anonymous information" means
information that is not associated with or linked to an individual and does
not, by itself, permit the identification of an individual. [CLS] [SEP]

act (fcra); and the driver’s privacy protection act of 1994. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **how we use personal data**

we primarily use, store, and process personal data to provide, understand,
improve, and develop our services, create and maintain a trusted and safer
environment, and comply with our legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP] we also use personal data
for the following purposes:

**2.1 provide, maintain, and support the services**

using personal data we collect, we are able to deliver the services to you and
honor our terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] we need to use personal data you provide to facilitate
the creation of and secure your account on our network, identify you as a user
in our system, provide improved administration and quality of experience of
our site and services, send email, call, or send sms text messages to you to
verify ownership of the email address or phone number provided when your
account was created, send you service, support or maintenance messages,
updates, security alerts, and account notifications. [CLS] [SEP] your personal data may
also be used for the detection and prevention of fraud, spam, abuse, and other
harmful activity, and for any purpose you authorize at the time of collection. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, to provide you technical support, we may need to review your
account and the contents of your account to identify, research, troubleshoot,
and resolve any issues that you report to us or that we otherwise become aware
of. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2 improve, personalize, and develop services**

we use personal data we collect to improve and personalize the services and to
develop new ones. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use personal data to troubleshoot and
protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research
and surveys; and develop new features and services. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.3 provide, personalize, measure, and improve our advertising and
marketing**

we may process personal data for marketing purposes including offering you
products or services that may be of interest to you (such as information about
fullcontact services or partner campaigns and other third party services). [CLS] [SEP] we
may also administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes,
contests, newsletters, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or
managed by fullcontact or its third party partners. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt-out of
receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe
instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your
notification settings within your fullcontact account. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.4 combine contacts for identity resolution & verification services**

certain categories of personal data may be combined to build more complete
contact records of individuals (“completed contact data”). [CLS] [SEP] completed contact
data reside in the fullcontact database and may be processed for the following
purposes in connection with providing identity resolution and verification
services:

    * grouping contacts and contact elements into unique individuals to create completed contact data. [CLS] [SEP]
    * generating and returning a unique identifier for an individual and associated completed contact data
    * linking (or "matching") input contact records to completed contact data for purposes of identifying an individual, searching for an individual, and/or linking to other contact records (such as those submitted by 3rd-parties) associated with the same individual. [CLS] [SEP]
    * deduplicating a set of input contact records based on unique individuals
    * inferring linkages between and/or deduplicating existing completed contact data
    * verifying the accuracy and recency of contact elements contained within input contact records

for example, someone may search or lookup a contact by name and email address. [CLS] [SEP]
fullcontact connects the name and email with a completed contact data within
the fullcontact database for one of the reasons above. [CLS] [SEP] no additional contact
data beyond the unique identifier are returned to the user submitting the
search. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.5 combine contacts for contact enrichment services**

certain categories of personal data may be made available to our customers and
partners in connection with providing enrichment services. [CLS] [SEP]

contact enrichment is often combined with identity resolution so that, for
example, a user is able to match a contact that they possess to our completed
contact data, and receive back a subset of the contact information from the
relevant completed contact data for that individual and/or other contacts
records linked to the same individual. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may return an
individual’s name to support features such as caller id. [CLS] [SEP] other examples of
data that may be returned by our enrichment services include: social handles,
hashed identifiers, basic demographic information, profile photos, consumer
interests, and professional information such as business emails,
organizational affiliation and job title. [CLS] [SEP] see our developer docs for a list of
currently available enrichment data. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.6 creation of deidentified, aggregate, or anonymous information**

we may create deidentified information, aggregate information, or anonymous
information records from personal data by excluding certain private data in a
manner that makes the data not personally identifiable. [CLS] [SEP] we use this
deidentified information, aggregate information, or anonymous information to
analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our
services and improve site navigation. [CLS] [SEP] fullcontact reserves the right to use
deidentified information, aggregate information, and anonymous information for
any purpose, including providing services to our users, and disclose
deidentified information, aggregate information, and anonymous information to
third parties in its sole discretion, including (but not limited to)

[CLS] [SEP] by placing an order, you agree to be bound by the terms of sale with respect to that order and all services, fullcontact data, or other offering related to that order. [CLS] [SEP] if this terms of use conflicts with the terms of sale, the terms of sale will govern and control with respect to the services, fullcontact data, or other offering provided to you under that order.

[CLS] [SEP] fullcontact will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it. [CLS] [SEP]
  7. [CLS] [SEP] **third party sites & ads; developers.**
    1. [CLS] [SEP] _third party sites & ads_. [CLS] [SEP] the site might contain links to third party websites, services, and advertisements for third parties (collectively, “ **third party sites & ads**”). [CLS] [SEP] such third party sites & ads are not under the control of fullcontact and fullcontact is not responsible for any third party sites & ads. [CLS] [SEP] fullcontact provides these third party sites & ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to third party sites & ads.

[CLS] [SEP] **disclaimers.** the site, services, and fullcontact data (including the api) are provided “as-is” and “as available” and we (and our licensors) expressly disclaim any warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including the warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, completeness, adequacy, or non-infringement.

  9. [CLS] [SEP] **limitation on liability**
    1. [CLS] [SEP] in no event shall we (and our licensors) be liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from or relating to this terms of use or your use of, or inability to use, the site, services, or fullcontact data (including the api), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] access to, and use of, the site, services, and fullcontact data (including the api) are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data resulting therefrom.

    2. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any damages arising from or related to this terms of use, the site services, fullcontact data (including the api) (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action), will at all times be limited to the greater of (a) fifty us dollars ($50) or (b) amounts you’ve paid company related to your orders in the prior 12 months (if any). [CLS] [SEP] the existence of more than one claim will not enlarge this limit. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that our suppliers will have no liability of any kind arising from or relating to this terms of use, the site services, fullcontact data (including the api). [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental of consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  10. [CLS] [SEP] **term and termination.** subject to this section, this terms of use will remain in full force and effect while you use the site, services, or fullcontact data. [CLS] [SEP] we may: (a) suspend your rights to use the site, services, or fullcontact data (including your account), or (b) terminate this terms of use, at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the site, services, or fullcontact data in violation of this terms of use.

[CLS] [SEP] even after this terms of use is terminated, the following provisions of this terms of use will remain in effect: sections 3-11. [CLS] [SEP]
  11. [CLS] [SEP] **general.**
    1. [CLS] [SEP] _changes to terms of use_. [CLS] [SEP] this terms of use is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our site. [CLS] [SEP] any changes to this terms of use will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our site. [CLS] [SEP] these changes will be effective immediately for new users of our site, services, or fullcontact data. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. [CLS] [SEP] continued use of our site, services, or fullcontact data following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP] _arbitration agreement and jury trial waiver, class action waiver, and forum selection clause_. [CLS] [SEP] all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and fullcontact arising out of, under, or related in any way to this terms of use or our privacy practices, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
      1. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration shall be subject to the federal arbitration act and not any state arbitration law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the american arbitration association (“aaa”). [CLS] [SEP] as modified by this terms of use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the aaa’s commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively “rules and procedures”). [CLS] [SEP]
      2. [CLS] [SEP] you are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under this contract except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] you are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. [CLS] [SEP]
      3. [CLS] [SEP] you and fullcontact must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing; (b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and fullcontact, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; (c) the arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory; (d) any claims brought by you or fullcontact must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (e) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding; (f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, fullcontact will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (g) fullcontact also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact or conclusion of law) against either you or fullcontact shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/fullcontact customer; and (j) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses. [CLS] [SEP]
      4. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or fullcontact may bring an individual action in small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you are a user outside of the united states, the privacy policy (dispute resolution for users outside of the united states), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy. [CLS] [SEP] further, claims of defamation, violation of the computer fraud and abuse act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision. [CLS] [SEP] such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the state or federal courts located in denver county, colorado. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. [CLS] [SEP] a request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP]
      5. [CLS] [SEP] with the exception of subparts (d) and (e) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. [CLS] [SEP] if, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor fullcontact shall be entitled to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] in the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event aaa refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and fullcontact shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in denver county, colorado. [CLS] [SEP]
      6. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on aaa, its rules and procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call aaa at 800-778-7879 or visit the aaa website at [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] _choice of law_. [CLS] [SEP] the terms of use is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of colorado, consistent with the federal arbitration act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]
    4. [CLS] [SEP] _entire agreement_. [CLS] [SEP] unless you later enter into any other agreements with fullcontact regarding the site, services, or fullcontact, this terms of use is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and fullcontact regarding your access to and use of the site, services, or fullcontact data. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided above, this terms of use supersede any prior agreement or proposal, oral or written, and any other communications between you and fullcontact relating to your use of the site, services, or fullcontact data. [CLS] [SEP] our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this terms of use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] the section titles in this terms of use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP] the word including means including without limitation. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this terms of use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this terms of use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] fullcontact will not be liable for any delay or non-performance of its obligations under this terms of use due to any cause beyond its control. [CLS] [SEP] your relationship to fullcontact is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. [CLS] [SEP] this terms of use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without fullcontact’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] the terms of this terms of use shall be binding upon assignees. [CLS] [SEP] there are no third party beneficiaries of this terms of use. [CLS] [SEP]
    5. [CLS] [SEP] _copyright/trademark information_. [CLS] [SEP] copyright © 2010-2019, fullcontact, inc. [CLS] [SEP] all rights reserved. [CLS] [SEP] all trademarks, logos and service marks (“ **marks** ”) displayed on the site are our property or the property of other third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you are not permitted to use these marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party which may own the marks. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that fullcontact may identify you as a fullcontact customer in advertising, media relations, trade shows, on the site, and other similar promotional activities. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] _uptime commitment._ the fullcontact data services will be available for 99.5% of the time during each calendar month ( **“uptime”** ).

an earlier policy, the data protection directive, which europe adopted in

certified executive as part of its corporate leadership. [CLS] [SEP]

makes available to the fullcontact platform for processing. [CLS] [SEP]

## data solutions customers:

these answers apply only to customers who are on the private plan and have
signed a data processing addendum (dpa) or will sign dpa as requested by
article 28 to satisfy gdpr compliance. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] under what conditions are fullcontact products & services gdpr
compliant?

fullcontact data products and services are gdpr compliant. [CLS] [SEP] for our data-
products, the customer must execute a data processing addendum (dpa). [CLS] [SEP] a
private plan is also an option available for additional privacy protection, so
no private data is ever stored in our data co-op and use of 3rd party sub-
processors, with the exception of amazon web services (aws), is restricted. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] what client personal data is covered under the gdpr?

only personal data of eea data subjects is covered under gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] however,
because it is often difficult to determine whether or not personal data
belongs to an eu data subject, for clients on the private plan, fullcontact
treats all client personal data as if it falls under gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] does a client on the private plan contribute to the data co-op?

no, the private plan (which is currently required for gdpr compliance) does
not allow for participation in the data co-op. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] can a client be on the private plan and also opt-in to using insights
bundles?

all insights bundles are available to customers on the private plan. [CLS] [SEP] this

history, key people, individual, professional, finance, household, purchases,
lifestyle, and shopping habits. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] what does fullcontact do with the personal data that a client submits
(e.g., a query to the fullcontact api)?

clients send client personal data (such as one or more personal identifiers)
to fullcontact when making an api request or providing a customer file for
matching. [CLS] [SEP] api queries are logged in order to honor our contractual obligations
related to fair billing. [CLS] [SEP] however, the log files of private plan clients record
only the minimum query fields necessary for billing purposes and any client
personal data is secured by encryption. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] how does fullcontact comply with the gdpr requirement for a processor
to provide a list of sub-processors?

we do not use any sub-processors for clients who have executed a dpa, except
for fullcontact's hosting provider, amazon web services, with all relevant aws
data centers used by fullcontact being located in the united states of
america. [CLS] [SEP]

## from where does fullcontact source data?

please see section 1, “personal data we collect”, of our [privacy
policy](/privacy/privacy-policy)
