# icloud security overview

icloud is built with industry-standard security technologies, employs strict
policies to protect your information, and is leading the industry by adopting
privacy-preserving technologies like end-to-end encryption for your data. [CLS] [SEP]

## data security

icloud secures your information by encrypting it when it's in transit, storing
it in icloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for
authentication. [CLS] [SEP] for certain sensitive information, apple uses end-to-end
encryption. [CLS] [SEP] this means that only you can access your information, and only on
devices where you’re signed into icloud. [CLS] [SEP] no one else, not even apple, can
access end-to-end encrypted information. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, your icloud data may be stored using third-party partners’
servers—such as amazon web services or google cloud platform—but these
partners don’t have the keys to decrypt your data stored on their servers. [CLS] [SEP]

end-to-end encryption requires that you have [two-factor
authentication](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht204915) turned on for your
apple id. [CLS] [SEP] keeping your [software up-to-
date](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht201222) and using two-factor
authentication are the most important things that you can do to maintain the
security of your devices and data. [CLS] [SEP]

here's more detail on how icloud protects your data. [CLS] [SEP]

**data** | **encryption** | **notes**  
---|---|---  
**in transit** | **on server**  
backup | yes | yes | a minimum of 128-bit aes encryption  
safari history & bookmarks | yes | yes  
calendars | yes | yes  
contacts | yes | yes  
find my (devices & people) | yes | yes  
icloud drive | yes | yes  
messages in icloud | yes | yes  
notes | yes | yes  
photos | yes | yes  
reminders | yes | yes  
siri shortcuts | yes | yes  
voice memos | yes | yes  
wallet passes | yes | yes  
icloud.com | yes | — | all sessions at icloud.com are encrypted with tls 1.2. [CLS] [SEP]
any data accessed via icloud.com is encrypted on server as indicated in this
table. [CLS] [SEP]  
mail | yes | no | all traffic between your devices and icloud mail is
encrypted with tls 1.2. [CLS] [SEP] consistent with standard industry practice, icloud
does not encrypt data stored on imap mail servers. [CLS] [SEP] all apple email clients
support optional s/mime encryption. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
### end-to-end encrypted data

end-to-end encryption provides the highest level of data security. [CLS] [SEP] your data
is protected with a key derived from information unique to your device,
combined with your device passcode, which only you know. [CLS] [SEP] no one else can
access or read this data. [CLS] [SEP]

these features and their data are transmitted and stored in icloud using end-
to-end encryption:

  * apple card transactions (requires ios 12.4 or later)
  * home data
  * health data (requires ios 12 or later) 
  * icloud keychain (includes all of your saved accounts and passwords)
  * maps favorites, collections and search history (requires ios 13 or later)
  * memoji (requires ios 12.1 or later)
  * payment information
  * quicktype keyboard learned vocabulary (requires ios 11 or later)
  * safari history and icloud tabs (requires ios 13 or later)
  * screen time
  * siri information
  * wi-fi passwords
  * w1 and h1 bluetooth keys (requires ios 13 or later)

to access your data on a new device, you might have to enter the passcode for
an existing or former device. [CLS] [SEP]

messages in icloud also uses end-to-end encryption. [CLS] [SEP] if you have icloud backup
turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your messages. [CLS] [SEP]
this ensures you can recover your messages if you lose access to icloud
keychain and your trusted devices. [CLS] [SEP] when you turn off icloud backup, a new key
is generated on your device to protect future messages and isn't stored by
apple. [CLS] [SEP]

### two-factor authentication

with [two-factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht204915), your
account can only be accessed on devices you trust, like your iphone, ipad, or
mac. [CLS] [SEP] when you want to sign in with your apple id on a new device the first
time, you need to provide two pieces of information—your password and the six-
digit verification code that's auto-displayed on your trusted devices. [CLS] [SEP]

### use of secure tokens for authentication

when you access icloud services with apple’s built-in apps (for example, mail,
contacts, and calendar apps on ios or macos), authentication is handled using
a secure token. [CLS] [SEP] secure tokens eliminate the need to store your icloud password
on devices and computers. [CLS] [SEP]

### health data

end-to-end encryption for health data requires ios 12 or later and two-factor
authentication. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, your data is still encrypted in storage and
transmission but is not encrypted end-to-end. [CLS] [SEP] after you turn on two-factor
authentication and update ios, your health data is migrated to end-to-end
encryption. [CLS] [SEP]

if you back up your device on your mac or itunes, health data is stored only
if the backup is encrypted. [CLS] [SEP]

## privacy

apple has a company-wide commitment to your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] our [privacy
policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) covers how we collect, use, disclose,
transfer, and store your information. [CLS] [SEP] and in addition to adhering to the apple
privacy policy, apple designs all icloud features with your privacy in mind. [CLS] [SEP]
