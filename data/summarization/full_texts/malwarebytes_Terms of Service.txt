# malwarebytes website terms of service

last updated: january 19, 2017

welcome to the malwarebytes inc. [CLS] [SEP] (" **malwarebytes** ") website,
malwarebytes.com (the "site"). [CLS] [SEP] please read these terms of service (the
"terms") carefully because they govern your use of our site (and its
subdomains) and related services accessible via our site, excluding (i) the
online store made available via the site which is governed by separate terms
and conditions, accessible at [
https://store.malwarebytes.com/342/?scope=optandc
](https://store.malwarebytes.com/342/?scope=optandc&id=jvc1cjx1rz%20) ; (ii)
the purchase and use of our malwarebytes software which is governed by the
separate end user license agreement, accessible at [
https://www.malwarebytes.com/eula ](/eula/) ; (iii) the malwarebytes privacy
policy accessible at [ https://www.malwarebytes.com/privacy/ ](/privacy/) ,
and (iv) other separate written terms and conditions or policies governing
specific malwarebytes products or services (collectively (i)-(iv) the
"excluded terms"). [CLS] [SEP] if there is a conflict between these terms and the excluded
terms, the excluded terms shall govern. [CLS] [SEP] to make these terms easier to read,
the site and our services are collectively called the "services."

**agreement to terms**

by using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't
agree to these terms, do not use the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are accessing and using
the services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal
entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
company or other legal entity to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, "you" and "your"
will refer to that company or other legal entity. [CLS] [SEP]

**changes to terms or services**

we may modify the terms at any time, at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if we do so,
we'll let you know either by posting the modified terms on the site or through
other communications. [CLS] [SEP] it's important that you review the terms from time to
time because if you continue to use the services after we have posted modified
terms on the site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the
modified terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't agree to be bound by the modified terms, then you
can't use the services anymore. [CLS] [SEP] because our services evolve over time we may
change, suspend or discontinue all or any part of the services, at any time
and without notice, at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

**who may use the services**

**eligibility**

you may use the services only if you are 18 years or older, capable of forming
a binding contract with malwarebytes, and are not barred from using the
services under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

**registration and your information**

if you want to use certain features of the services, such as our forums, blog
and support services, you must create an account ("account"). [CLS] [SEP] you can do this
via the site or, in some cases, through your account with certain third-party
social networking services such as facebook or twitter (each, an "sns
account"). [CLS] [SEP] if you choose the sns account option we'll create your account for
the forums, blog or support services, as applicable, by extracting from your
sns account certain personal information such as your name and email address
and other personal information that your privacy settings on the sns account
permit us to access. [CLS] [SEP] if you create an account to participate in a public
facing service such as forums, you understand and accept that certain account
profile details, including but not limited to your profile name and photo will
be available to the public as well as the posts and comments that you publish. [CLS] [SEP]
we will respect the choices you make to limit visibility as designated in your
account settings. [CLS] [SEP]

it's important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date
information and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it
accurate, complete and up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't, we may suspend or terminate
your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you won't disclose your account
password to anyone and that you will notify us immediately of any unauthorized
use of your account. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all activities that occur under
your account, whether or not you know about them. [CLS] [SEP]

**feedback**

malwarebytes welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to
the services ("feedback"). [CLS] [SEP] you can submit feedback by emailing malwarebytes at
[policies@malwarebytes.com](mailto:policies@malwarebytes.com) . [CLS] [SEP] any feedback
you provide through the services shall be deemed to be non-confidential. [CLS] [SEP]
malwarebytes shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis
without any obligation to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**privacy policy**

please refer to our privacy policy [ https://www.malwarebytes.com/privacy/
](/privacy/) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information
from our users. [CLS] [SEP] by using our services, you agree that malwarebytes can use
such data in accordance with our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] in connection with your use
of the services, we may send you service announcements, administrative
messages, and other information. [CLS] [SEP] you may opt out of some of those
communications. [CLS] [SEP]

**content and content rights**

for purposes of these terms: (i) "content" means text, graphics, images,
music, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other
materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available
through the services; and (ii) "user content" means any content that account
holders (including you) provide to be made available through the services. [CLS] [SEP]
content includes without limitation user content. [CLS] [SEP] for avoidance of doubt,
"content" does not include software made available by malwarebytes via the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark
or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the
services or content. [CLS] [SEP]

**rights in user content granted by you**

of any applicable law or regulation. [CLS] [SEP]

failure to remove or delete) any of your user content. [CLS] [SEP]

**limitation of liability**

to the extent permitted by law, neither malwarebytes nor any other party

out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to
use the services or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort

damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of
its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent permitted by law, in no event will malwarebytes' total liability
arising out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or
inability to use the services or content exceed fifty u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars ($50 usd). [CLS] [SEP]
some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing
limitation may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**general terms**

these terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
between malwarebytes and you regarding the services and content, and these
terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings
or agreements between malwarebytes and you regarding the services and content. [CLS] [SEP]
these terms control the relationship between malwarebytes and you. [CLS] [SEP] they do not
create any third party beneficiary rights. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a court of
competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms invalid or
unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible and the other provisions of these terms will remain in full force
and effect. [CLS] [SEP] these terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties,
their successors and permitted assigns. [CLS] [SEP]

terms, including those regarding modifications to these terms, will be given
by malwarebytes: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the services. [CLS] [SEP] for
notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which
such notice is transmitted. [CLS] [SEP]

malwarebytes' failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms will
not be considered a waiver of those rights. [CLS] [SEP] the waiver of any such right or
provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
representative of malwarebytes. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly set forth in these terms,
the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these terms will be
without prejudice to its other remedies under these terms or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

the laws of california, u.s.a., excluding california's conflict of laws rules,
will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] all
claims arising out of or relating to these terms will be litigated exclusively
in the federal or state courts of santa clara county, california, u.s.a., and
you and malwarebytes consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. [CLS] [SEP]
