[gdpr privacy policy](/privacy-policy-gdpr/) and the [gdpr data processing
addendum](/data-processing-agreement-gdpr/) constitute an agreement (the
"agreement") between you and sync inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates and
licensors ( "we," "us" or "sync").**

please read these terms carefully before using sync. [CLS] [SEP] by clicking the "create
account" button or by using the sync site, software or services ("services"),
you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by these terms on your behalf
and, if applicable, on behalf of your organization. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are using any sync services on behalf of an organization or business,

business. [CLS] [SEP] when you use sync services on behalf of that organization or
company, the term "you" refers to the organization or business. [CLS] [SEP]

you may use these services only in compliance with the terms. [CLS] [SEP] any other use is
not authorized. [CLS] [SEP] the services may change over time as we improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]
we may stop, suspend, or modify the services at any time without prior notice

review the most current version of these terms at

### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer of warranties

you agree that your use of the products is at your sole risk, and the products

resellers, partners and their respective affiliates expressly disclaim all
warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including the implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-
infringement. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, sync.com, its suppliers, resellers, partners and
their respective affiliates make no warranty that (a) the products will meet

acknowledge that the products are not intended or suitable for use in
applications that could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that some jurisdictions do not allow the type of exclusion listed
above, so some of these exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

to the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will sync.com, its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for
any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential
(including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of
legal theory, whether or not sync.com has been warned of the possibility of
such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] the
aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services shall be no more
than the greater of $100 usd or the amounts paid by you to sync.com for the
most recent twelve-month period for the services in question. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that some jurisdictions do not allow the type of limitation listed
above, so some of these limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### 13\. [CLS] [SEP] publicity

for sync business solo and business pro customers you grant us the right to
add your company name and / or company logo to our sales presentations,
customer list and website. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out by emailing help@sync.com anytime. [CLS] [SEP]

### 14\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous legal terms

these terms and the use of the services and software will be governed by
ontario law except for its conflicts of laws principles. [CLS] [SEP] all claims arising
out of or relating to these terms or the services or software must be
litigated exclusively in the federal or provincial courts of ontario, canada,
and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and sync
with respect to the services, and supersede and replace any other agreements,
terms and conditions applicable to the services. [CLS] [SEP] these terms create no third
party beneficiary rights. [CLS] [SEP] sync's failure to enforce a provision is not a
waiver of its right to do so later. [CLS] [SEP] if a provision is found unenforceable the
remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in full effect and an
enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as
possible. [CLS] [SEP] you may not assign any of your rights in these terms, and any such
attempt is void, but sync may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or
subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with
the services. [CLS] [SEP] sync and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our
relationship is that of independent contractors. [CLS] [SEP]
