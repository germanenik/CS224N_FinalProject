# sprint terms and conditions

effective september 1, 2020  

  
thanks for choosing sprint! please read our terms & conditions (“ts&cs”),
which describe your relationship with sprint, including our agreement to
arbitrate disputes, instead of using class actions or jury trials. [CLS] [SEP] click any
of the blue **more** links to see the full text of the sprint wireless terms
and conditions. [CLS] [SEP]

**who are we talking about?** sprint is sprint, you are you, your phone,
tablet, or other equipment or accessory is called a device and our services
include our offers, plans and customer care. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**what does your service agreement with sprint look like?** your service
agreement includes everything we give you (hand to you, email you, read to
you, etc.) when you get your service. [CLS] [SEP] read them! if there’s a disagreement,
you agree to resolve it by arbitration and agree to a class action waiver. [CLS] [SEP]
more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**anything else in my service agreement?** yes, our policies. [CLS] [SEP] our policies are
easy to find! find a comfy spot and check them out here. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**any limitations on how i use my device?** yes. [CLS] [SEP] please check your contracts. [CLS] [SEP]
if you buy, lease or finance a device, we rely on your agreement to activate
on our network. [CLS] [SEP] under certain circumstances you may not resell, trade in or
profit from reselling or trading in your device. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**how do i accept the service** **agreement?** if you sign, email, e-sign,
open the box, or tell us on the phone that you agree, you have agreed! you
must be of legal age. [CLS] [SEP] **** and most importantly, when your service is
activated, you have agreed! if you don’t want to agree, don’t do any of these
things. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**how will sprint talk to me about the service** **agreement? how can i get in
touch with you?** there are many ways to get in contact with us. [CLS] [SEP] and we can
reach out to you through any number we have, your bill, or the my sprint app
for any purpose. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**do i still have a commitment? what about an early termination fee?** it’s
simple. [CLS] [SEP] we love having you as a customer and don’t want you to leave. [CLS] [SEP] but if
you agree to a 1- or 2-year service agreement, and you cancel that contract
early, you will be charged an early termination fee (etf). [CLS] [SEP] the etf was
explained when you first agreed to the contract. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**when do i have to pay an early termination fee?** great news! there is no
etf if you complete your service agreement. [CLS] [SEP] remember, you may have other
commitments like a lease or installment agreement with their own termination
terms. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**what happens if sprint changes the agreement?** if sprint changes this
agreement, and you think it has a materially adverse impact on you, you can
call within 30 days of the change and ask us to cancel without paying your
etf. [CLS] [SEP] if we don’t hear from you, then we’ll consider the change fine by you. [CLS] [SEP]
more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**can sprint suspend or terminate services?** we hope we won’t need to do this
but . [CLS] [SEP] . [CLS] [SEP] . [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to suspend, cancel, or block service any time
for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**how do i change my services and when are changes effective?** while many
changes take place immediately, some will not. [CLS] [SEP] so know that changes made mid-
bill-cycle may be prorated (meaning you may only be charged a portion of the
fee, charge, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**how do i terminate services?** if you want to terminate service, please call
us – and at least let us hear you out! more ... [CLS] [SEP]

device have their own terms and privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]

constantly working to make it better. [CLS] [SEP] how it works for you is based on your
location, your device, the weather, and many other factors. [CLS] [SEP] more... [CLS] [SEP]

not rely on your device’s location information. [CLS] [SEP] not all of your device
features will work when you contact 911. [CLS] [SEP] more ... [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**what if my device is lost or stolen?** please let us know immediately if
your device is lost or stolen. [CLS] [SEP] lost or stolen devices don’t get you out of

dispute resolution and arbitration_  
  
please read this carefully; it affects your rights**

**how will we resolve disputes?** through mandatory arbitration or in small
claims court. [CLS] [SEP] if we have a dispute, we agree to resolve it using arbitration
or small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] we also agree to resolve our issues in a proceeding
with only two parties (you and sprint) instead of by class action (thousands
of people and sprint). [CLS] [SEP] in arbitration, an arbitrator replaces the judge and
jury. [CLS] [SEP] disputes are any (we really mean any) disagreements about our
relationship. [CLS] [SEP] we also agree to attempt to resolve any disputes informally
before beginning any legal proceedings, so first let us know what the problem
is and your proposed solution in writing. [CLS] [SEP] [more

**how does arbitration work?** the arbitration will be heard by a single
arbitrator, follow a standard set of rules (known as the aaa rules) and will
be located in the county of your billing address. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act
(“faa”) applies to this agreement and arbitration provision. [CLS] [SEP] sprint will pay
for any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and the
professional fees for the arbitrator’s services. [CLS] [SEP] [more

**what about going to court?** we won’t go to court, there will be no jury
trial and no class actions. [CLS] [SEP] if somehow we end up in court, we agree that a
judge will resolve our dispute rather than a jury and we will litigate
individually instead of as part of a group, or class. [CLS] [SEP] [more

_full text of the sprint wireless terms and conditions_  
  
who are we talking about?** when we say “we,” “us,” “our,” or “sprint,” we
mean sprint solutions, inc. [CLS] [SEP] when we say “you,” “your,” “customer,” and “user,”
we mean a sprint account holder or someone who uses our devices or services. [CLS] [SEP]
“device,” means any phone, tablet, mobile broadband device, or any other
product or accessory we provide, sell, or that is active on your account with
us. [CLS] [SEP] “service(s)” mean sprint-branded offers, rate plans, options, wireless
services, billing services, applications, programs, products, software, or
devices on your account with us, as well as any other product or service that
we offer or provide to you that references these general terms and conditions
of service (“ts&cs”). [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what does my service agreement with sprint look like? **these ts&cs are part
of your service agreement with us (the “agreement”) and are the contract under
which we provide you services. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement contains a mandatory arbitration
provision with a class waiver, a representative action waiver, and a jury
waiver provision. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to these ts&cs, the agreement includes: (i) the
subscriber agreement and transaction materials that you receive and accept
when you get your device; (ii) the service plan(s) that you chose as described
in the written services and transaction materials that we provide or refer you
to during the sales transaction; (iii) any confirmation materials and invoices
that we may provide to you; and (iv) the terms set forth in the coverage map
brochures. [CLS] [SEP] we strongly recommend that you carefully read all of the terms of
the agreement. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**anything else in my service agreement?** when you accept the agreement, you
are agreeing to our business policies, practices, and procedures (“policies”),
including our acceptable use policy, our privacy policy, our visitors
agreement, and our network management and the open internet practices. [CLS] [SEP] to read
more, go here: http://www.sprint.com/legal/index.html. [CLS] [SEP] we may change our
policies at any time, so please check our policies for updates. [CLS] [SEP] [back to
top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)  
  
**any limitations on how i use my device?** if you get a device from sprint or
a sprint authorized retailer without paying full price (msrp) for the device,
you agree not to resell or trade in, or participate or profit in the resale or
trade in, of the device to a third party until you have met all your financial
and contractual obligations to us. [CLS] [SEP] if you do this without meeting your
obligations, we reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary,
including charging you for the difference between the device’s full price and
the price you paid for it, and seeking recovery of related damages. [CLS] [SEP] if you
have a separate agreement with sprint to acquire, purchase, or lease a device,
any restrictions on resale in that agreement will also apply, so please refer
to the terms of any such agreement to understand your rights to resell your
device. [CLS] [SEP] [back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-
conditions#top)  
  
**how do i accept my agreement?** you must have the legal capacity to accept
the agreement you accept the agreement when you:

  * agree in writing or by electronic signature or by telling us you accept by email, over the phone, online, or in person; or
  * activate, use, or attempt to use, the services; or
  * pay for the services; or
  * open any package or start any program that says you are accepting the agreement by doing so. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t want to accept the agreement, don’t do any of these things. [CLS] [SEP] back

**how will sprint talk to me about my agreement? how can i get in touch with
sprint?** except as the agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must
provide us notice by calling or writing us as instructed online at
www.sprint.com/contactus. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide you notice through one or more of
the following: in your bill, correspondence to your last known billing
address, to any fax number or email address you’ve provided us, by calling you
on your device or any other phone number you’ve provided us, by voice message
on your device or any other phone number you’ve provided us, by sms or text
message on your device, or through your my sprint application. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**do i still have a commitment?** ****what about an early termination fee?
some of our services have a minimum term, usually 1 or 2 years (“term
commitment”), during which you agree to keep and pay for your services. [CLS] [SEP] if
your agreement contains a term commitment, you will be charged a fee (“early
termination fee”) for each line of service that you terminate before
satisfying your term commitment or for each line of service that we terminate
early for good reason (for example, violating the payment or other terms of
the agreement). [CLS] [SEP] any early termination fee will be prorated based on the length
of your remaining term commitment. [CLS] [SEP] early termination fees are a part of our
rates for agreements with term commitments. [CLS] [SEP] any term commitment, the length of
the term commitment, and the applicable early termination fee amounts and
proration will be disclosed to you during the sales transaction. [CLS] [SEP] carefully
review any term commitment and early termination fee requirements prior to
selecting services. [CLS] [SEP] after you have satisfied your term commitment, your
services automatically continue on a monthly basis under the then-current
terms and conditions and service policies. [CLS] [SEP] services offered on a subscription
basis may not require a term commitment and may not automatically renew. [CLS] [SEP] as
explained directly below, there are times when you may not be responsible for
an early termination fee for terminating services early. [CLS] [SEP] [back to
top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)  
  
**when do i have to pay an early termination fee?** if you have completed your
term commitment, do not have a term commitment, or are returning your device
under our published return policy, you will not need to pay an early
termination fee when you terminate service. [CLS] [SEP] if you still have a term
commitment, you will be responsible for paying your prorated early termination
fee unless you are responding to a materially adverse change that we make to
the agreement as described directly below. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what happens if sprint changes the agreement? **we may change prices or any
other term of your service or this agreement at any time. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll provide you
notice of any material changes and may provide notice of nonmaterial changes. [CLS] [SEP]
if you use your service after the change takes effect, then you are accepting
the change. [CLS] [SEP] you may have a rate plan, pricing, or services that are offered
only if you are eligible and qualify. [CLS] [SEP] if at any point you no longer qualify
and are not eligible, or if certain rate plans or services are no longer
supported or available, please notify us or, in some cases, sprint will notify
you and give you notice of the change(s) to your plan or services. [CLS] [SEP] if we make
a materially adverse change to your agreement, you may terminate the
materially affected line of service without paying an early termination fee by
contacting customer care within 30 days after the effective date from the
notice, and providing the reason for cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] if we do not agree to fix
the materially adverse change, then you may terminate your service without
paying the etf. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not call us, and you cancel any service within 30
days of the change, an early termination fee will apply to the cancelled
services that are under a term commitment. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**can sprint suspend or terminate services?** we can, without notice, suspend
or terminate any service at any time for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we can
suspend or terminate any service for: (a) late payment; (b) exceeding an
account spending limit; (c) harassing/threatening/abusing/offending or being
excessively impolite to our employees or agents; (d) interfering with our
operations; (e) using/suspicion of using services in a way that violates or is
inconsistent with the agreement and policies or adversely affects any of our
other customers, reputation, network, property, or services; (f) breaching,
failing to follow, or abusing the agreement or policies; (g) providing false,
inaccurate, dated, or unverifiable information, including identification or
credit information; (h) becoming insolvent or bankrupt; (i) modifying a device
from its manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); (j)
failing to use our services or maintain an active device; (k) you resell or
attempt to resell the services or (l) if we believe the action protects our
interests, any customer’s interests, or our network. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**how do i change my services and when are changes effective?** we want you to
be 100% thrilled with your sprint services! if you want to change your
services, you should go to sprint.com, and you can typically change services
immediately. [CLS] [SEP] in some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of an
early termination fee or certain other charges, or require a new term
commitment some changes to services may not be effective until the start of
the next full invoicing cycle. [CLS] [SEP] if the changes take place sooner, your invoice
may reflect prorated charges for your old and new services. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**how do i terminate services?** if you are thinking about cancelling your
service with sprint, please call us or visit a sprint store so that we can try
to change your mind! if we are unable to change your mind, you can terminate
services by calling us and requesting that we deactivate all services, or by
porting your number to another carrier. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all charges
billed or incurred prior to deactivating your service. [CLS] [SEP] if services are
terminated before the end of your invoicing cycle, we won’t prorate charges to
the date of termination and you won’t receive a credit or refund for any
unused services. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**how does sprint protect my privacy?** we care deeply about your privacy, and
we want you to understand how we treat your data. [CLS] [SEP] as you use the services, we
develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type,
location, and destination of telecommunications products and services you use,
as well as some other information, some of which is considered cpni under
federal law. [CLS] [SEP] please take a moment to review our privacy policy, available at
sprint.com/legal/privacy.html. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**what is cpni?** as we provide telecommunications products and services to
you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical
configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products
and services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill
(“cpni”). [CLS] [SEP] under federal law, you have the right and we have a duty to protect
the confidentiality of your cpni. [CLS] [SEP]

  * how do i keep my account secure? your pin, passwords, and other account credentials are specific to you and are yours to protect. [CLS] [SEP] anyone who has access to this information, has access to your account. [CLS] [SEP] you (the account holder) may be required to password protect your account information byestablishing a personal identification number (“pin”). [CLS] [SEP] you may also be required to set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your pin. [CLS] [SEP] sprint may treat anyone who presents your credentials as you or as an authorized user. [CLS] [SEP] we may disclose your account information or make changes in service based on a request by someone with your account credentials. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we may contact you for service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the services or devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, sms, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail. [CLS] [SEP]
  * what information is on my device? your device contains sensitive, personal information. [CLS] [SEP] sprint is not responsible for any information on your device, including sensitive or personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your device is out of your possession or control a. [CLS] [SEP] by submitting your device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your device. [CLS] [SEP] if you exchange, return, or recycle your device through us, we typically attempt to erase all data on your device, but you must remove all data from your device before you provide it to us. [CLS] [SEP]

how can i use my device, number and email address? **we don’t manufacture any
device that you use with our services, including the devices we provide. [CLS] [SEP] that
means we aren’t responsible for any defects, acts, omissions, or other
problems with your device. [CLS] [SEP] check with your manufacturer to determine whether
there are any warranties on your device. [CLS] [SEP] device performance may vary based on
device specifications (for example, a device’s software, memory, and storage),
and device performance may impact access to our services. [CLS] [SEP] your device is
designed to be activated on our network and in other coverage areas that we
may make available to you. [CLS] [SEP] except for any legal right you may have to
port/transfer your phone number to another carrier, you have no—and cannot
gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)—proprietary, ownership,
or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or
other identifier that we assign to you, your device, or your account. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll
notify you if we decide to change or reassign them. [CLS] [SEP] we do not guarantee that
any port or transfer of your phone number will be successful. [CLS] [SEP] your sprint
phone may have be programmed with restrictions that prevent another carrier's
sim card from being inserted into your phone’s sim slot for use on a different
network. [CLS] [SEP] sprint will unlock a capable device, provided the device is eligible
per sprint’s unlocking policy. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please visit
sprint.com/unlock. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what if i bring my own device? **sprint allows you to bring a device that you
already own to be activated on the sprint network. [CLS] [SEP] when you activate a “sprint
compatible” device or a device that was designed to be used on a network other
than the sprint network, not all of your services may work, or they may not
work correctly. [CLS] [SEP] just as with any other device, if you bring your own device to
be activated on the sprint network, sprint is not responsible for your device,
including whether your device works correctly. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**what about the apps i download?** are you going to download all your
favorite apps onto your new device? of course, you are!! we want you to know
that when you download or use certain applications, programs, devices, and
services, you may be required to accept terms specific to those items. [CLS] [SEP]
generally, the terms will come from the app developer, software licensor,
etc., which may be sprint or someone else. [CLS] [SEP] any terms for third party apps are
between you and the third party. [CLS] [SEP] additional terms for bundled services may
either modify or replace certain provisions in these ts&cs, including terms
relating to activation, invoicing, payment, and disputing charges. [CLS] [SEP] when you
use these items, you are agreeing that they may access, collect, use, or
disclose your personal information and that sprint may disclose your
information—including location information—to a third party. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**where and how will my device work?** our coverage maps are available at our
authorized retail locations and on sprint.com/coverage. [CLS] [SEP] your signal, and your
specific network coverage will depend on the radio transmissions your device
can pick up and services you’ve chosen. [CLS] [SEP] our coverage maps show our coverage
estimates using services outdoors under optimal conditions. [CLS] [SEP] coverage isn’t
available everywhere, is not guaranteed, and is subject to change without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] service speeds are not guaranteed, and depend on the service purchased
as well as other factors, such as your device, your location, structures,
buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you
access, network problems, network or internet congestion, software, signal
strength, actions of third parties, etc. [CLS] [SEP] services that rely on location
information, such as e9-1-1 and gps navigation, depend on your device’s
ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and
network coverage. [CLS] [SEP] while your device is receiving a software update, you may be
unable to use your device in any manner, including to call 9-1-1, until the
software update is complete. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**what about roaming (off-net)?** when we talk about “roaming,” we are talking
about coverage on another carrier’s network. [CLS] [SEP] your device generally lets you
know when you’re roaming. [CLS] [SEP] our right to provide coverage on another carrier’s
network may change from time to time, and roaming coverage may change without
notice and may not always be available. [CLS] [SEP] whether your device can roam depends
on your device, your services, and the availability of roaming coverage. [CLS] [SEP]
certain services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for
example, data services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] separate charges or
limits for voice or data services may apply while roaming. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what about using data services?** our data services and your device may allow
you to access the internet, email, text, take pictures and video, download and
play games, video, music, graphics, sound, applications and other materials
(“content”) or send content elsewhere. [CLS] [SEP] we have no control over the content
that you access on your device. [CLS] [SEP] content may be: (1) unsuitable for
children/minors; (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or
objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] you’re solely responsible for evaluating the content accessed
by you or anyone through your device or services. [CLS] [SEP] we strongly recommend that
you monitor data usage by children/minors. [CLS] [SEP] content from third parties may also
harm your device or its software. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for any content, any
damage caused by any content that you access through your services, that you
load on your device, or that you request that our representatives access or
load on your device. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on content and restrictions on
content, see your service plan details. [CLS] [SEP] if we provide you storage for content
that you have purchased, then we may delete the content without notice or
place restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas. [CLS] [SEP] content stored on a
device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by sprint may be deleted,
modified, or damaged. [CLS] [SEP] you may not be able to make or receive voice calls while
using data services. [CLS] [SEP] content provided by our vendors or third parties may be
cancelled or terminated at any time without notice to you, and you may not
receive a refund for any unused portion of the content. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**are there things i cannot do with sprint’s data services?** you cannot
violate these terms. [CLS] [SEP] our data services are designed for use with your sprint
device for reasonable and non-continuous internet access such as web surfing
and non-continuous downloading, streaming, gaming and other personal internet
access services. [CLS] [SEP] you can’t use our data services: (1) with server devices or
host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous, heavy
traffic or data sessions or automatically consume unreasonable amounts of
network capacity; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame
relay connections; (3) for automated machine to machine connections or
purposes that are designed for unattended use, or (4) for any other unintended
use as we determine in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] you may tether your sprint device
to other lawful devices pursuant to the allotments contained in your plan for
use of your device as a hotspot or when the device and plan are specifically
intended for that purpose (for example, 4g hotspots, wireless routers, data
link, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] you also can’t use our data services in a manner that is
unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, or harms or unduly
interferes with the use of sprint’s network or systems. [CLS] [SEP] our data services may
not be used to disrupt email use by others using automated or manual routines,
including, but not limited to “auto-responders” or cancel bots or other
similar routines; to transmit or facilitate any unsolicited or unauthorized
advertising, telemarketing, promotional materials, “junk mail,” unsolicited
commercial or bulk email, or fax; or for activities adversely affecting the
ability of other people or systems to use either sprint’s wireless services or
other parties’ internet-based resources, including, but not limited to,
“denial of service” attacks against another network host or individual user. [CLS] [SEP]
we may limit, suspend, constrain, or terminate your service for use that
violates these terms or for any heavy, continuous data usage or usage that
adversely impacts our networks’ performance, hinders access to our networks,
or that we determine is necessary to protect our networks from harm or
degradation. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
  
**what about our billing relationship?** now that you are a sprint customer,
we want you to understand how we do things, especially how we get your service
set up and what your bill will include. [CLS] [SEP]

  * will you check my credit? yes. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to give us credit information so that we can determine whether to provide or continue to provide your services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * will i have an account spending limit? we may place a temporary or permanent account spending limit (asl) on your account to limit the amount you can charge , regardless of when payment on those charges is due, and we may suspend your services without prior notice if your account balance reaches the asl, even if your account is not past due. [CLS] [SEP]
  * what about a deposit? we may at any time require a deposit as a guarantee of payment so that you may get or keep sprint service (“deposit”). [CLS] [SEP] you can’t use a deposit to make or delay payments. [CLS] [SEP] unless prohibited by law, we may mix deposits with our other funds, the deposit won’t earn interest, and we reserve the right to return the deposit as a credit on your invoice at any time, including on any unpaid balance after you terminate services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * are there other fees? we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain services. [CLS] [SEP] certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] we will tell you if any of these fees apply to your requested transaction. [CLS] [SEP]
  * can i authorize other users? you are responsible for any changes to your services made by a person you authorize, including adding or removing services or features to your account, receiving notices and disclosures on your behalf, purchasing devices for use with our service, or entering into a new term commitment, all of which may result in additional charges, and are considered modifications to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**what does my bill include?**

  * your bill will include charges for your monthly recurring amount, usage, additional services, taxes, surcharges, product and equipment charges, subscription charges, third party charges and fees associated with your services. [CLS] [SEP] these charges are described or referred to during the sales transaction, in our marketing materials, and in confirmation materials that we may send to you. [CLS] [SEP] please check online if you want more detailed information about your bill. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your bill may also include other important notices (for example, changes to your agreement, to your service, legal notices, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

back to top

**how will you calculate my charges?**  

  * voice calls: for charges based on the amount of time used, we round up partial minutes to the next full minute. [CLS] [SEP] you are billed for connected calls including calls to voice mail and your rate is based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not your device location or area code. [CLS] [SEP] calls begin when you push a button or graphic to initiate the call or when the call connects to the network and they end when you hang up or end the call, or the network connection breaks. [CLS] [SEP] calls may be subject to maximum duration and automatically terminated if exceeded. [CLS] [SEP] **off-rate plan charges.** unlimited talk is for direct communications between 2 people. [CLS] [SEP] you may have to pay extra for calls to some numbers (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] conference & chat lines, broadcast, calling card, international, 900 or 976 calls, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] 
  * data **:** data is measured in bytes and are rounded up to kilobytes (kb) at the end or during a data session. [CLS] [SEP] data usage may be presented on your bill as kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes (each, a “data increment”). [CLS] [SEP] you are charged for all data directed to your device’s internet address, including sessions that support your device functions (including any applications you have downloaded on your device), as well as data sessions you did not initiate. [CLS] [SEP] data charges may be rounded to the next cent if you are billed by a data increment. [CLS] [SEP] data estimates are not reliable predictors of actual data usage. [CLS] [SEP]
  * push-to-talk charges: charges for push-to-talk calls are billed to the person who starts the call and calculated by multiplying the duration of the call by the applicable rate and number of participants. [CLS] [SEP] you’re charged at least 6 seconds of airtime for each call you start; subsequent communications in the same call are rounded up to and billed to the next second. [CLS] [SEP] time begins when you press any button to start a push-to-talk call and ends approximately 6 seconds after completion of a communication to which no participant responds. [CLS] [SEP] subsequent push-to-talk communications are considered new calls. [CLS] [SEP] charges apply for the entire period of time the push-to-talk call is connected to our network. [CLS] [SEP] depending on your plan, nationwide, international, or group push-to-talk calls may use the local push-to-talk minutes in your plan and result in additional or different charges. [CLS] [SEP] responses to call alert transmissions are treated as new push-to-talk transmissions even when responding within 6 seconds of receiving the alert. [CLS] [SEP] push-to-talk billing methods are subject to change as we introduce new push-to-talk services. [CLS] [SEP]

**what are the other fees?**  

  * additional fees? depending on your services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, texts, and internet access. [CLS] [SEP]
  * surcharges. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to pay all surcharges (“surcharges”), including, but not limited to: federal universal service; regulatory and administrative charges; gross receipts charges, and other charges. [CLS] [SEP] surcharges are not taxes and are not legally required; rather they are part of our rates and we choose to collect them from you to recover certain costs. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide detail about any surcharges on your invoice, and we may change them at any time. [CLS] [SEP] information on surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website. [CLS] [SEP]

back to top

**what about paying my bill?**

  * you must pay the full amount of your bill on the due date. [CLS] [SEP] if we do not receive payment in full by the due date, you may be assessed a late fee, which may be charged at the highest rate permissible by law and may be applied to the total unpaid balance. [CLS] [SEP] if we use a collection agency to collect unpaid balances from you, we may charge you for those costs. [CLS] [SEP] if we bill you for amounts on behalf of a third party, payments received are first applied to our charges. [CLS] [SEP] certain methods of payment may have additional fees. [CLS] [SEP] we may charge you, up to the highest amount permitted by law, for returned checks or other payments paid by you and denied for any reason by a financial institution. [CLS] [SEP] acceptance of payments (even if marked “paid in full”) does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us. [CLS] [SEP] we may restrict your payment methods to cashier’s check, money order, or other similar secure form of payment at any time for good reason. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **if you provide your credit and debit card information to us at any time, you authorize us to charge your cards until successful for all delinquent amounts you owe us. [CLS] [SEP] sprint may obtain updated information from card networks, issuers or other third-party sources.**

**who will contact me regarding billing and collections?** you expressly
authorize, and specifically consent to allowing, sprint and any of sprint’s
agents to contact you in connection with any and all matters relating to
unpaid past due charges you owe sprint. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that, for attempts to
collect unpaid past due charges, sprint and any of its agents may contact you
at any mailing address, telephone number, cellular phone number, email
address, or any other electronic address that you have provided, or may in the
future provide, to sprint. [CLS] [SEP] you agree and acknowledge that any e-mail address
or any other electronic address that you provide to sprint is your private
address and is not accessible to unauthorized third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for attempts to
collect unpaid charges, you agree that in addition to individual persons
attempting to communicate directly with you, any type of contact described
above may be made using, among other methods, pre-recorded or artificial voice
messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, pre-set e-mail
messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system, or any other pre-set
electronic messages delivered by any other automatic electronic messaging
system. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
do i have a software license for the software on my device?** sprint grants
you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license or sublicense to use
software, in accordance with the applicable software licensing terms. [CLS] [SEP] no
rights are granted to source code. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot use any software on behalf of
third parties or for time share or service bureau activities and cannot
reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or enhance any software. [CLS] [SEP] sprint may block
or terminate your use of any software if you fails to comply with applicable
licensing terms. [CLS] [SEP] sprint may revoke this license at any time. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
how do location-enabled services work?** our networks generally know the
location of your device when it is outdoors and/or turned on. [CLS] [SEP] by using various
technologies to locate your device, we can provide enhanced emergency 9-1-1
services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third
party. [CLS] [SEP] network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures,
buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly
impact the ability to access your device’s location information and use of
location-enabled services. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any authorized user may access, use,
or authorize sprint or third-party location-enabled applications through the
services. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that your use of any location-enabled applications is
subject to the application’s terms and policies, including its privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
if you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized
users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for
location-enabled applications and that the device may be located. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
is calling 9-1-1 or other emergency numbers different on my device?** public
safety officials advise that when making 9-1-1 or other emergency calls, you
should always be prepared to provide your location information. [CLS] [SEP] depending on a
number of factors (for example, whether your device is gps-enabled, where you
are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment,
etc.), 9-1-1 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the
location of your device. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes, an emergency call may be routed to a state
patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service
providers. [CLS] [SEP] enhanced 9-1-1 service (“e9-1-1”)—where enabled by local emergency
authorities—uses gps technology to provide location information. [CLS] [SEP] even when
available, however, e9-1-1 does not always provide accurate location
information. [CLS] [SEP] if your device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire
a satellite signal, you may not be located. [CLS] [SEP] some devices have a safety feature
that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 9-1-1—you should follow voice
prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing
interactive voice response systems to screen calls. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what if my device is lost or stolen?** call us immediately if your device is
lost or stolen because you may be responsible for usage charges before you
notify us of the alleged loss or theft. [CLS] [SEP] a lost or stolen device does not
affect your term commitment, and you will still be responsible for an early
termination fee if you terminate services early. [CLS] [SEP] you will still be responsible
for any lease or installment billing obligations, as well as any monthly
recurring charges associated with the service on your device after you notify
us of the alleged loss or theft. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to cooperate if we choose to
investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
is there a warranty on my services?** unless expressly provided in writing
otherwise, we make no representations or warranties, express or implied,
including (to the extent allowed by law) any implied warranty of
merchantability, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose
concerning your services (including your device and any software or
applications on your device). [CLS] [SEP] we don’t promise uninterrupted or error-free
services and don’t authorize anyone to make warranties on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] sprint
provides all software and applications on an “as is” basis with all faults,
errors, and defects. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
is sprint responsible for certain problems?** you agree that neither we nor
any third party involved in providing services are responsible for any
damages, delay, interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: (a)
providing or failing to provide services, including, but not limited to,
deficiencies or problems with a device or network coverage (for example,
dropped, blocked, interrupted services, etc.); (b) traffic or other accidents,
or any health-related claims relating to our services; (c) an interruption or
failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a device,
including through 9-1-1, enhanced 9-1-1 or otherwise; (d) interrupted, failed,
or inaccurate location information services; (e) information or communication
that is blocked by a spam filter; (f) damage to your device or any computer or
equipment connected to your device, or damage to or loss of any information
stored on your device, computer, equipment, or sprint storage space from your
use of the services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content,
materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or (g) things beyond our
control, including acts of god (for example, weather-related phenomena, fire,
earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government
orders or acts. [CLS] [SEP] back to top  
**  
what is sprint’s liability?** to the extent allowed by law, our liability for
monetary damages for any claims that you may have against us is limited to no
more than the proportionate amount of the service charges attributable to the
affected period. [CLS] [SEP] under no circumstances are we liable for any incidental,
consequential, punitive, multiple, or special damages of any nature whatsoever
arising out of or related to providing or failing to provide services in
connection with a device, including, but not limited to, lost profits, loss of
business, or cost of replacement products and services. [CLS] [SEP] back to top

_  
dispute resolution and arbitration_  
  
** **please read this carefully; it affects your rights  
**  
**how will we resolve disputes?** we want you to be happy with your sprint
services. [CLS] [SEP] if, for some reason, we cannot resolve your concern to your
satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and sprint each agree to
try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice
of the dispute as set forth below. [CLS] [SEP] if we cannot resolve the dispute despite
our good-faith efforts, you and sprint agree that we will resolve the dispute
through binding individual arbitration or in small claims court, instead of
courts of general jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] [back to
top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)

**mandatory arbitration and waiver of class action**  
  
you and we each agree that any and all claims or disputes (as defined below)
will be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
you and sprint agree that any proceedings will be conducted on an individual,
non-representative, basis, and not as a class, representative, mass, or
consolidated action. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and
sprint are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
action or representative action. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to arbitrate is intended to be
broadly interpreted. [CLS] [SEP]

in arbitration, there is no judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] instead, a neutral third-party
arbitrator resolves disputes in a less formal process than in court. [CLS] [SEP] in
arbitration, there is limited discovery and a court review of the arbitrator’s
decision is limited. [CLS] [SEP] however, just as a court would, the arbitrator must
follow the terms of the agreement and can award damages and other relief,
including attorneys’ fees, as authorized by law. [CLS] [SEP]

“disputes” include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies
against each other in any way related to or arising out of our services or the
agreement, including wireless coverage, devices, billing services and
practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), and
service, privacy, or advertising claims, even if the claim arises after
services have terminated. [CLS] [SEP] disputes also include, but are not limited to,
claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the services or
devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other
representatives; (b) you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or
equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any
way our services or the agreement; or (c) that sprint brings against you. [CLS] [SEP]
disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related
to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and sprint,
whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation,
advertising claims or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before
this agreement or out of a prior agreement with sprint; (iii) claims that are
subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member;
and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)**

**dispute notice and dispute resolution period**  
  
before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and sprint each
agree to first provide to the other a written notice (“notice of dispute”),
which will contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant
documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific
relief sought. [CLS] [SEP] a notice of dispute to sprint should be sent to: general
counsel; arbitration office; 12502 sunrise valley drive, mailstop
varesa0202-2c682; reston, virginia 20191. [CLS] [SEP] sprint will provide a notice of
dispute to you in accordance with the “how will sprint talk to me about my
agreement?” section of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] sprint will provide you a designated
representative to work with to try to resolve your dispute to your
satisfaction. [CLS] [SEP] you and sprint agree to make attempts to resolve the dispute
prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. [CLS] [SEP] if an agreement
cannot be reached within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice of dispute,
you or sprint may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action. [CLS] [SEP]
[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)

**how does arbitration work?**

  * to begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration to us (see the “dispute notice and dispute resolution period” section above) and to the american arbitration association (“aaa”). [CLS] [SEP] if the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or we may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the aaa under its consumer arbitration rules then in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, except to the extent any of those rules conflicts with this agreement, in which case this agreement will govern. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are available at www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * unless you and sprint agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the service. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the aaa will send the parties a list of five candidates; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from that list, each party will return its list to the aaa within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; (c) the aaa will appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the aaa may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] we will pay or reimburse all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. [CLS] [SEP] except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if permitted under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the federal arbitration act (“faa”) applies to this agreement and arbitration provision. [CLS] [SEP] we each agree that the faa’s provisions—not state law—govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] 

**[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)**

**_class action waiver_**

**you and** **we each agree that any proceedings, whether in arbitration or
court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class,
representative, mass, or consolidated action**. [CLS] [SEP] if we believe that any claim
you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with this
limitation, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining
whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver. [CLS] [SEP] if a court
or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this
class action waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim, the
arbitration agreement and class action waiver will not apply to that claim,
but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may
assert in that or any other action. [CLS] [SEP]

[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)

**_jury trial waiver_**

if a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, **you and** **we
each waive any right to a jury trial**. [CLS] [SEP] ****

[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)

**what happens if someone sues sprint based on something you actually
caused?** you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold sprint and our
subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors
harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions,
including, but not limited to, your use of the service and any information you
submit, post, transmit, or make available via the service; failing to provide
appropriate notices regarding location-enabled services; failure to safeguard
your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question, or other
account information; or violating this agreement or any policy referenced in
this agreement, any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third
party. [CLS] [SEP]

[back to top](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#top)

**anything else?** subject to federal law or unless the agreement specifically
provides otherwise, this agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state
encompassing the billing address of the device, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of that state. [CLS] [SEP] if either of us waives or doesn’t
enforce a requirement under this agreement in an instance, we don’t waive our
right to later enforce that requirement. [CLS] [SEP] except as the agreement specifically
provides otherwise, if any part of the agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, the rest of this agreement remains in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement isn’t for the benefit of any third party except our corporate
parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in
interest. [CLS] [SEP] you can’t assign the agreement or any of your rights or duties under
it, unless we agree to the assignment. [CLS] [SEP] we can assign the agreement without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot in any manner resell the services to another party. [CLS] [SEP] the
agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement
between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements—you can’t rely
on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service
representatives. [CLS] [SEP] the rights, obligations, and commitments in the agreement
that—by their nature—would logically continue beyond the termination of
services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 9-1-1, dispute
resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of services. [CLS] [SEP]
