# what happens to your data

let us take you into the intricacies of what happens to your data. [CLS] [SEP] you may
like to navigate directly to the sections as follows:

  * a. [CLS] [SEP] how we use personal data we collect
  * b. [CLS] [SEP] choice
  * c. [CLS] [SEP] billing data
  * d. [CLS] [SEP] support
  * e. [CLS] [SEP] marketing
  * f. [CLS] [SEP] online identifiers
  * g. [CLS] [SEP] in-product messaging
  * h. [CLS] [SEP] service data
  * i. [CLS] [SEP] account data
  * j. [CLS] [SEP] live events and competitions
  * k. [CLS] [SEP] kamo privacy policy

## a. [CLS] [SEP] how we use personal data we collect

the personal data we collect may come directly from you or we may obtain it
from other sources, such as our service providers and resellers. [CLS] [SEP]

we want you to understand the types of personal data we process and if we do
not obtain your personal data directly from you, the source we used, and the
specific data collected. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect personal data for these reasons: to process the purchase of a
product or service; to provision the product or service to you; and for the
legitimate interests of us. [CLS] [SEP] we use no more than the minimum amount of personal
data needed for the processing. [CLS] [SEP] we also use personal data only when the
processing is necessary for our or our third party’s legitimate interests. [CLS] [SEP]

when our use of your personal data is based on the legitimate interests of us
and is compatible with the provision of service, you have the right to object. [CLS] [SEP]
in some cases, you may exercise your right to object directly, for example you
may unsubscribe to email marketing messages or you may choose to turn off data
use in the applicable product settings; in other cases you may notify us here:
support@ccleaner.com and we will investigate the grounds relating to your
particular situation. [CLS] [SEP]

avast is a global business and we have operations and personnel around the
world who process personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we have standard contractual clauses in place
among its affiliates which govern the transfer and use of personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

in the following sections, we explain the personal data we collect. [CLS] [SEP] please be
mindful that some of the categories may collect the same personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

## b. [CLS] [SEP] choice

you can make certain choices about how your data is used by us. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
if you have purchased a product or service from us, you will be able to choose
how data collected from you is used. [CLS] [SEP] this choice is made in the relevant
product settings. [CLS] [SEP] please note, if you purchased a product from us and in your
product settings you do not see one or more of these choices, it means your
collected data is not being used in that particular category. [CLS] [SEP] the choices are:

  * cross-product direct marketing: – when we offer you another product from a company within our group. [CLS] [SEP]
  * cross-product development – when we collect data from one product and use it for the development of another product. [CLS] [SEP]
  * third party ads – when we offer any third-party products. [CLS] [SEP]
  * third party analytics – when we share your data with a third party for analytics, such as purchase optimization, crash reporting, and trend analytics. [CLS] [SEP] note, all free users and paid customers can choose to turn off this feature. [CLS] [SEP] 

## c. [CLS] [SEP] billing data

paid products and services for your personal computer

when you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your personal
computer, the billing is handled by a third-party service provider. [CLS] [SEP] the
service provider is acting as our agent; thus, you will be making your
purchase from the service provider directly, and not from us. [CLS] [SEP]

if you purchase a "premium" or paid product or service, we, through our third-
party service providers, will collect your name, email address, credit card
number, and in certain circumstances, your billing address and your phone
number (collectively “billing data”). [CLS] [SEP] your billing data will be retained for
as long as is necessary to complete payment, including any renewal periods. [CLS] [SEP]

your billing data is collected by our third-party service providers only where
necessary for the purposes of processing or refunding your payments, or so
that they can communicate with you. [CLS] [SEP] your billing data may also be retained for
legal reasons, for example, taxation. [CLS] [SEP]

the third-party service provider may transmit your billing data (excluding
credit card number) to us. [CLS] [SEP] we use the billing data to create a record of its
software installations or service requests. [CLS] [SEP] we may process and store the
billing data we receive, to verify your registration or license status, to
contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your
subscription, if applicable. [CLS] [SEP] we process the billing data as necessary for the
provision of the contract and service. [CLS] [SEP]

in all cases where your credit card number is processed by a third-party
service provider, we have determined that the service provider follows data
privacy and security procedures that we deem adequate. [CLS] [SEP] some of these third-
party service providers are subject to the enhanced data privacy rules of the
european union. [CLS] [SEP] others have self-certified annually to comply with the eu-us
privacy shield or the swiss-us privacy shield. [CLS] [SEP]

in all cases such third-party service providers have executed agreements with
us promising not to use your personal data for their own marketing purposes,
and not to share this information with other parties for their unrestricted
use. [CLS] [SEP]

we store your billing data separately from your service data (defined below). [CLS] [SEP]

we may change service providers as we carry out our business. [CLS] [SEP] in that case,
your billing data will be transferred from one service provider to another. [CLS] [SEP]
when this happens, you will be informed of such transfer. [CLS] [SEP]

paid products and services for your mobile device

when you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your mobile
device, the billing is handled by a third-party app store, such as google play
and apple itunes. [CLS] [SEP] you will be making your purchase from the third party app
store directly, and not from us. [CLS] [SEP]

your billing data is collected by the third party app store and your billing
data is not shared with us. [CLS] [SEP]

paid products and services for your business

when you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your business,
the billing is handled by our reseller or distributor. [CLS] [SEP] you will be making your
purchase from the reseller or distributor directly, and not from us. [CLS] [SEP]

your billing data is collected by the reseller or distributor. [CLS] [SEP] your billing
data, excluding your credit card number, may be shared with us. [CLS] [SEP] we use the
billing data to create a record of the software installations. [CLS] [SEP]

we may process and store the billing data we receive, to verify your
registration or license status. [CLS] [SEP] but, generally, we will not contact you. [CLS] [SEP] your
reseller or distributor will contact you about the status of your account, or
for renewal of your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] we process the billing data as necessary for
the provision of the contract and service. [CLS] [SEP]

the handling of your billing data (excluding your credit card number) shared
with us by the service provider, reseller, or distributor will be governed by
this privacy policy and the end user license agreement applicable to the
product or service from us. [CLS] [SEP] your billing data inclusive of your credit card
number collected by the service provider, reseller, distributor, or third
party app store to process your payment and renewal will be governed by any
privacy policy or terms of service published by the applicable third-party
service provider, reseller, distributor, or the third party app store. [CLS] [SEP]

in some instances, we change resellers or distributors as we carry out our
business. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, your billing data will be transferred from one
reseller or distributor to another. [CLS] [SEP] when this happens, you will be informed of
such transfer. [CLS] [SEP]

what about free products?

you are not required to disclose billing data to download our free products
and services for your pc and mobile device, which includes free antivirus,
free mobile security, and free ccleaner for desktop. [CLS] [SEP] however, our free
ccleaner cloud product does require you provide your name and email address to
register for the product. [CLS] [SEP]

## d. [CLS] [SEP] support

we directly or through our third party technical support service provider(s)
collect your name, email address, phone number(s), home or work address, or
other information by which we may identify you while providing technical
support. [CLS] [SEP] we need this data for verification and to communicate with you about
your support request. [CLS] [SEP]

in cases where you request individual support or assistance we may ask you to
provide information about your device or computer, your means of accessing the
internet, or information about your internet service provider. [CLS] [SEP] to provide the
technical support we also collect data that may include your email address, ip
address, information about your hardware and software, the urls of sites you
have visited, files stored on your computer (including potentially dangerous
or infected files), email messages (whether stored on your computer or
elsewhere), information regarding senders and receivers of email messages, and
the like. [CLS] [SEP] if you request support, we may offer you the option of accepting a
remote session in which we take control of your device or computer in order to
help you resolve the issue. [CLS] [SEP]

information collected while providing the support will not be used for
secondary purposes, other than, we may use your email address to send you
information about other us products or services. [CLS] [SEP] if you contact us for
support, we may suggest that you upgrade or update products or services. [CLS] [SEP]
information and data connected to provision of support will be retained by us
to have a history of support requests and for support research purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## e. [CLS] [SEP] marketing

when we collect your email address, we may market our other products and
services to you. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to unsubscribe from future email marketing by
following the instructions in the email. [CLS] [SEP]

generally, we do not serve third party ads in its products for the personal
computer. [CLS] [SEP] we may serve third party ads in our products for mobile devices. [CLS] [SEP]

to be able to offer you our services for free, we show third party ads within
your mobile apps through popular ad networks, which are listed below. [CLS] [SEP] we
display an adchoices logo on top of every ad. [CLS] [SEP] you can tap the icon to learn
more about the ad network. [CLS] [SEP]

to enable the ad, we embed a third-party software development kit (sdk) for
these ads. [CLS] [SEP] the sdk code is provided by third party ad agencies or networks. [CLS] [SEP]

data of our mobile users remain anonymous to us and to the third party ad
agencies. [CLS] [SEP] however, the ad agencies’ sdk code will collect data to tailor ads
to you, such as the third-party apps you installed on your device, your
android advertising identifier, your ip address, your device's operating
system details and mac address, and other statistical and technical
information. [CLS] [SEP] you can find more information in each network’s privacy policy,
the link to which we are also including in the overview below. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not want to view third party ads, you may uninstall the free mobile
product and/or choose an available paid version of mobile products, which does
not serve third party ads. [CLS] [SEP]

## f. [CLS] [SEP] online identifiers

software. [CLS] [SEP] for paid customers of products and services for your personal
computer, the guid is connected to your billing data. [CLS] [SEP] for free users of
products and services for your personal computer and your mobile deice, and
for paid customers of business and mobile products and services, as there is
no billing data collected by us, the us guid is disconnected from personal
data. [CLS] [SEP]

the guid is used for many purposes, which will be described in this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies

please note that not all of our websites use all of these cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

we may partner with a third party either to display advertising on our site or
to manage our advertising on this site and other sites. [CLS] [SEP] our third party
partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your
activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising
based upon your browsing activities and interests. [CLS] [SEP] by continuing to browse our
websites, you are aware of the use of cookies, as described in this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to allow the use of cookies, you can disable them
through your browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] we do note, however, that not all browsers
across all platforms may support this functionality. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, if you
disable cookies, our websites may not function properly or your access to our
websites and their features may be affected or restricted. [CLS] [SEP]

ip address

we collect your ip address to provision your product or service. [CLS] [SEP] we also use
the ip address with mobile products to serve ads. [CLS] [SEP] we strive to replace your ip
address within sixty days of collecting it with your city and country or we
hash your ip address. [CLS] [SEP]

## g. [CLS] [SEP] in-product messaging

we sometimes communicate with you using a technique known as "in-product
messaging." in-product messaging may be used in the following scenarios:

  * when your license is about to expire;
  * when you update or upgrade an us program; 
  * when a virus database is updated; 
  * when you visit an infected webpage; 
  * when a monthly security report is prepared for you; or 
  * in other cases where user communication is necessary for provision of our products or services. [CLS] [SEP] 

we also use in-product messaging to notify you of different products or
upgrades to existing products and services. [CLS] [SEP] data used for in-product messaging
is connected to the guid for in-product messaging to function. [CLS] [SEP] for free users,
this data remains anonymous and for paid customers, the data is pseudonymized. [CLS] [SEP]

billing data is however not used for in-product messaging. [CLS] [SEP] in-product
messaging also permits your computer or device to transmit information to our
servers including technical data, virus definitions, security, and technical
information about your hardware. [CLS] [SEP]

the data may be used to offer you a discount on a new product based on your
past purchases. [CLS] [SEP] data is also used for analytical and statistical purposes,
product updates, quality control, and in-product and feature design. [CLS] [SEP] premium
or paid customers can manage in-product messaging for marketing purposes in
the applicable product settings. [CLS] [SEP]

## h. [CLS] [SEP] service data

service data is collected from your use of our websites, products, and
services. [CLS] [SEP]

service data is used primarily to provision the products or services. [CLS] [SEP] service
data is also used for the compatible and legitimate uses of research, to
compile statistics, analytics, aggregated reporting, product development, in-
product messaging, and direct marketing. [CLS] [SEP] before service data is used for
secondary purposes, us pseudonymizes or anonymizes the service data. [CLS] [SEP]

for all service data, we practice “data minimization”, which means we limit
our collection and retention of your data to only what is necessary, adequate
and relevant to achieve our processing purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

below we list our products and the service data that each collects. [CLS] [SEP] there may
be other products (current or future) that require us to collect certain types
of personal data to enable full product functionality. [CLS] [SEP] we will always inform
you prior to collecting any such information, usually in the terms of service
or end user license agreement (eula) or the privacy notice applicable to the
product or service. [CLS] [SEP] personal data collected as part of service data is
necessary to the provision of the product functionality. [CLS] [SEP] when personal data is
no longer needed we limit or stop using it in line with the minimization
principle. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your email, the urls of websites you have visited,
your files, are scanned for malware detection and protection; then we remove
your email address and other personal data or we hash any identifiers turning
the service data into pseudonymized or anonymized data for paid users and
anonymized data for free users before we re-use the service data for research,
analytics, statistics, reporting, cross-product development, in-product
messaging, and marketing. [CLS] [SEP]

the primary processing of service data will be to perform the contract to
provision the product or service to you. [CLS] [SEP] the secondary processing of service
data will be as compatible for the legitimate interests of us to provide you
the benefits of research, analytics, cross-product development, and cross-
product in-product messaging. [CLS] [SEP] if we need to process your service data for a
purpose that requires consent, we will notify you separately of this and the
general rules of providing and withdrawing consent shall apply. [CLS] [SEP]

website log files

we collect the information in the form of server log files that tell us
generally about the visitors to our site, which may include general geographic
regions, length of visits, the webpages you request, the urls of the site you
were viewing before clicking on our websites, your ip address, cookies, the
type of web browser and operating system you are using, click-stream data and
so forth. [CLS] [SEP]

if a user downloads a product from our website, we connect the installation
guid with the user’s website log. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to fulfil our
legitimate interests, which are to analyse overall trends, administer our
webpages, track users’ use of the webpages, help us improve our website(s),
and to better understand the users’ experience on our website(s) when
downloading and activating our products. [CLS] [SEP]

device and network information

we may collect information about the computer or device you are using, our
products and services running on it, and, depending on the type of device it
is, what operating systems you are using, device settings, application
identifiers (ai), hardware identifiers or universally unique identifiers
(uuid), software identifiers, ip address, location data, cookie ids, and crash
data (through the use of either our own analytical tools or tolls provided by
third parties, such as crashlytics or firebase). [CLS] [SEP] device and network data is
connected to the installation guid. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use your device and network data for in-product-messaging and cross-
product development. [CLS] [SEP] premium or paid customers can manage in-product messaging
for marketing purposes and cross-product development in the applicable product
settings. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect information in the form of statistics through our own or third-
party analytics about which apps have been installed or uninstalled, how they
are used, the number of active users, and the impact apps have on device
performance and battery consumption (collectively, “appinfo”). [CLS] [SEP] from this we
study device and network behaviour, purchasing history and trends to measure
the relative success of our products over time (in other words, serve our
legitimate interests). [CLS] [SEP]

analytics and crash reporting

we use analytical tools, including third party analytical tools, which allow
us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues
with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you
use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user
experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] while we generally
prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other
parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and
expertise. [CLS] [SEP] below, we list these partners, their tools which we use, as well as
additional information on where and how we use them. [CLS] [SEP]

our apps use google analytics to allow us to understand how our users use and
interact with our products and how to improve our products. [CLS] [SEP] where our apps use
google analytics for apps or the google analytics for firebase sdks, google
analytics collects an app-instance identifier -- a randomly generated number
that identifies a unique installation of an app. [CLS] [SEP] whenever a user resets their
advertising identifier (advertising id on android, and id for advertisers on
ios), the app-instance identifier is also reset. [CLS] [SEP] where our apps have
implemented google analytics with other google advertising products, like
adwords, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics
also collects internet protocol (ip) addresses to provide and protect the
security of the service, and to give us a sense of which country, state, or
city in the world our users come from (also known as "ip geolocation"). [CLS] [SEP] we do
implement measures and best practices in order to avoid sending personal data
when collecting analytics data such as: safeguarding our data, ip
anonymization, ip masking, data retention, user deletion and access
management. [CLS] [SEP]

firebase analytics is a service that helps us understand our users and how
they use apps including information about interactions with the user's mobile
applications. [CLS] [SEP] firebase analytics uses identifiers for advertising on mobile
applications (for example, android advertising id and identifier for
advertisers for ios - idfa), and we will collect the aaid and idfa for these
above-mentioned purposes. [CLS] [SEP] users who wish to opt-out of the aaid and idfa
advertisement tracking can do so through device advertising settings for
mobile apps within your device and users who wish to avoid tracking by
firebase analytics can opt-out in application settings. [CLS] [SEP] data collected will be
transmitted to and stored by google on servers globally. [CLS] [SEP]

purpose of understanding through which marketing campaign you were directed to
us and to evaluate the success and performance of our marketing campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] the
data collected by appsflyer includes data such as ip address, identification
of the advertising campaign, app event data such as first app launch and
settings and device info. [CLS] [SEP] access to this data and its protection is governed
by the appsflyer privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] data necessary for the identification of a
marketing campaign and evaluation of its success is also shared with
respective advertising providers. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out of appsflyer analytics
tracking by changing the privacy settings within your app (third party

software and the newer ones no longer use it. [CLS] [SEP] it helps us understand the
makeup of people who engage with our app by logging events from the app via
facebook's android sdk. [CLS] [SEP] this tool enables us to observe how many users install
the app, how frequently users activate the app, how much time users spend
using it, and other demographic information which helps us better understand
how users interact with our product. [CLS] [SEP]

logentries is a cloud-based repository where we send multiple logs from our
desktop apps to logentries such as activations and installer logs and update
check pings. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to search the logs and run queries on the data for
the purposes of tracking errors, fixing bugs and resolving technical issues,
as well as compiling generic statistics on, e.g., user, install or activation
count and understanding how you use our products. [CLS] [SEP] we also log parameters from
a device to check if they are eligible for certain installer offers, such as
chrome or avast. [CLS] [SEP]

this tool uses unique identifiers of the installation and device. [CLS] [SEP] these unique
identifiers contain ip addresses, but we hash this data and do not keep it in
its original form as soon as possible (usually within 30 days) when data gets
stored. [CLS] [SEP]

#### desktop apps

ccleaner, ccleaner mac, ccleaner business edition and ccleaner technician
edition

ccleaner cleans and de-clutters your hard drive, makes your operating system
run faster and helps make your browsing on the internet more private and
secure. [CLS] [SEP]

recuva

recuva is a windows app that allows you to search your hard drives and usb
drives and recover any deleted files (if deleted with standard windows
deletion). [CLS] [SEP]

speccy

speccy is a windows tool that allows you to receive an audit of your computer
hardware and software. [CLS] [SEP] you may publish this information to an online page if
you wish to share. [CLS] [SEP]

defraggler

defraggler allows you to optimise your older hard drives so they run faster. [CLS] [SEP]

#### software as a service (saas) product

saas products allow you to connect to and use cloud-based apps via the
internet. [CLS] [SEP]

ccleaner cloud

ccleaner cloud is offered as both a free and paid version. [CLS] [SEP] the platform allows
users and businesses to remotely manage their computers centrally from the
platform. [CLS] [SEP]

for free users, we collect personal data including your name, email address,
ip address and computer events, for example when you install software. [CLS] [SEP] this
data is necessary to provide and improve our services by connecting this data
with the usage logs. [CLS] [SEP] for professional and business users, we collect the same
personal data as for the free user and additionally, we may collect your
company name, billing information and mobile number. [CLS] [SEP] the data is necessary to
complete the contract when you subscribe to our services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### business-only product

ccleaner network

ccleaner network is a business-only product that is installed locally on your
server and allows you to manage and clean your company’s computers. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
receive any data as this is a local-only closed network product. [CLS] [SEP]

avast android cleanup, avg cleaner, avg cleaner for xperia, and ccleaner for
android (piriform)

avast android cleanup, avg cleaner, avg cleaner for xperia, and ccleaner for
android (piriform) access your device storage to delete data that is not in
use. [CLS] [SEP] you will be asked to allow your android operating system to access your
device storage. [CLS] [SEP] the feature sees what’s in your device, for example the apps
and files you have downloaded, ranging from your music playlist to photos. [CLS] [SEP]
however, everything takes place locally on your device and nothing is
transmitted to our servers. [CLS] [SEP]

since we do not collect or store any personal data, any data collected is
anonymous. [CLS] [SEP]

we also offer you a cloud service connection for you to back up your files so
nothing important gets deleted. [CLS] [SEP] you may sign-in to google drive, dropbox or
microsoft onedrive directly from cleanup. [CLS] [SEP] this feature is optional. [CLS] [SEP] if you use
this feature, you will be storing your files with a third party and thus this
is subject to the third party’s terms of service and privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## i. [CLS] [SEP] account data

there are a variety of accounts you can create with us. [CLS] [SEP]

account data is the data you give when you open an account or request a
service from us and may including your name, address, email address, phone
number, photo, date of birth, gender, and interests (collectively, “account
data”). [CLS] [SEP] account data may include the same data as in your billing data (such
as name and email), but account data is not connected to your credit card
number and, except in a few instances described below, is not connected to
your service data. [CLS] [SEP] we process this data in order to provide you with the
relevant account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### examples of accounts and services

avast and avg accounts

accounts are tools which permit you to register multiple products using a
single registration and authentication system. [CLS] [SEP] if you use these accounts, you
will be asked to provide your email address directly or indirectly via social
media login. [CLS] [SEP] this is used for authentication. [CLS] [SEP]

opening an account is voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] for paid and trial customers, there is the
convenience of managing your licenses and seeing your connected devices in the
account portal. [CLS] [SEP]

once you delete your account, your account data will be deleted, but this will
not delete other records of your name or your email address stored at us. [CLS] [SEP]

some products may require you to establish an avast account for the provision
of the service or to provide the product functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

contact us

there are many opportunities to contact us via our website. [CLS] [SEP] there are links
that allow you to reach us by email via the support page, by clicking our
media contact or news subscription buttons, or by requesting online service or
support. [CLS] [SEP] in general, the amount of information that we collect when you
contact us will be in proportion to the nature of the contact. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if
you contact us by email, we will require your email address to reply. [CLS] [SEP]

newsletters and blog notifications

we offer news and information on our website, including email newsletters and
blog notifications of current news items. [CLS] [SEP] this is a free service we provide to
you. [CLS] [SEP] you may receive an ad banner on our website promoting a news story. [CLS] [SEP]
however, you must subscribe if you wish to read it. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use your email to send you information on other publications or other
us products or services. [CLS] [SEP]

when you subscribe, we request your first and last names, email address, and
country of residence. [CLS] [SEP] we process your personal information to help develop
content that is interesting to our audiences and to send you relevant blog
notifications and/or newsletters. [CLS] [SEP]

you are free to cancel your news subscription(s) at any time by clicking the
unsubscribe link at the bottom of an email we have sent you. [CLS] [SEP]

"refer a friend"

there may be times when we post a "refer a friend" link that allows a site
visitor to send a message to a friend about an avast product or service. [CLS] [SEP] we
will never request that our users provide a friend's phone number or other
contact information. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have any record of the email address that you
use to send the message. [CLS] [SEP] it is up to the friend to install. [CLS] [SEP]

sometimes the friend referral takes place when you install a product. [CLS] [SEP] when the
friend installs, we collect the guids and information that your two
installations are connected. [CLS] [SEP]

this concludes the description of personal data collected by us when you
purchase products and services or when you register for an account or request
services. [CLS] [SEP] the next section covers the data collected by us from the
installation and during the running of our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we call this
service data. [CLS] [SEP]

## j. [CLS] [SEP] live events and competitions

aside from interacting with you by way of your use or purchase of our products
and services, us may collect your personal data from you directly, when we
attend trade shows or when you participate in our promotional events or
competitions. [CLS] [SEP]

when you interact with us at trade shows and provide us with your personal
data on a business card or through other means (for instance, through
registering for an event we are holding at such trade show), we will be
processing your personal data for the purposes of building and expanding our
database of existing or prospective business partners. [CLS] [SEP] we will use this
contact information in order to communicate with you about possible business
partnerships or other similar opportunities, and to promote our brand across
the industry (serve our legitimate interests). [CLS] [SEP]

live events and competitions held and organized by us generally require that
you register first. [CLS] [SEP] to complete a registration, you provide us with your name,
your e-mail address and other relevant information, which is marked as
“required” (this could, for instance, include information about your technical
background, if you are registering for one of our competitions). [CLS] [SEP] we may also
take photos or videos of the competition. [CLS] [SEP]

provision of live event(s) and competition(s) data is voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] however, if
you do not provide us with the information marked in the form as “required”,
you will not be able to participate. [CLS] [SEP] we will also sometimes process
information about your social media accounts (links to your twitter, facebook
or other social media accounts), should you choose to provide them. [CLS] [SEP] avast will
process the “required” as well as other voluntary information in order to
assess your application, register you for the event and to communicate with
you about it. [CLS] [SEP] we may use your image in photos or videos on our website or as
part of our general promotion and marketing efforts. [CLS] [SEP] we will also use your
email address to communicate with you about new us events and about other
products and services from us. [CLS] [SEP]

some of our competitions are carried out through social media or networks. [CLS] [SEP] in
that case, the privacy policy of that particular social network will apply. [CLS] [SEP]

## k. [CLS] [SEP] kamo privacy policy

as kamo is a purely privacy-focused service, we treat its data collection
differently than our other applications. [CLS] [SEP] you can see below where it differs. [CLS] [SEP]

#### official product name

kamo

#### core functionality

as you browse the web, profiles of your behavior are compiled and linked to
you via cookies and fingerprint-based tracking technologies. [CLS] [SEP] this data can be
shared and sold by analytics and ad-tech firms. [CLS] [SEP] certain activities you do are
also collected by the windows operating system. [CLS] [SEP] kamo removes cookies and masks
the device’s “fingerprint” to prevent third-parties from identifying you and
following your behavior across the web, and turns off the various settings
that allow data collection in the windows operating system. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what are kamo's features

  * **antifingerprinting** stops scripts from fingerprinting the user's device and tracking their browsing behavior across the web. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, os version, os locale, and kamo version. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **privacy score** provides the user with an evaluation of how private they are based on various in-app configurations. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, os version, os locale, kamo version, in-app settings (such as features that are turned on/off). [CLS] [SEP]
  * **clears your browsing history and cookies** helps the user manage their browsing history and cookies by allowing them to manually clear them or schedule automatic clearing at their discretion. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, os version, os locale, kamo version, in-app settings (such as features that are turned on or off). [CLS] [SEP]
  * **windows system privacy** collates the 90+ windows operating system settings that impact the user's privacy, and makes them controllable with just a handful of switches in one place. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, this feature relies on processing the os version, hardware data, os locale, kamo version, in-app settings (such as features that are turned on or off). [CLS] [SEP] 

#### personal data we process

we process only the following service and device data (in addition to [billing
data](https://www.ccleaner.com/about/privacy-policy/what-happens-to-your-
