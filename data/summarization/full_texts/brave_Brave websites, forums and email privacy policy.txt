# brave websites, forums, and email privacy policy

read this document to understand how brave software (âusâ, âweâ,
âbraveâ, etc.) use data to operate its websites, forums, and
communications. [CLS] [SEP] to learn how we use data for the brave browser, see the [brave
browser privacy policy](/privacy/browser/). [CLS] [SEP] to learn how we use data for
publishers and creators, see the [publisher privacy
policy.](/privacy/publishers-creators/)

## infrastructure __

brave websites are hosted on infrastructure we operate, and on infrastructure
operated on our behalf by amazon, heroku (a salesforce company), and fastly. [CLS] [SEP]
fastlyâs infrastructure is designed to be as close to you as possible â
probably in the same country as you, though this is not guaranteed. [CLS] [SEP] the rest
of this infrastructure is located in the united states, which is where
information is processed and stored only for as long as necessary to provide
services to you and support brave do this. [CLS] [SEP] we take a range of technical and
organisational measures to safeguard any personal data processed including the
use of eu standard contractual clauses. [CLS] [SEP] wherever possible we try not to
process personal data. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing details. [CLS] [SEP]

## community forums __

brave provides two forums by which you can post feedback and comments on
braveâs services and publicly communicate with other brave users -
[community.brave.com](https://community.brave.com) and
[forum.batcommunity.org](http://forum.batcommunity.org). [CLS] [SEP] while brave runs
these forums, they are hosted on our behalf by the platform provider,
discourse. [CLS] [SEP]

use of our forums is subject not only to braveâs privacy policy but also
[that of discourse](https://www.discourse.org/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] in a nutshell, your
personal data will be used to operate and improve the forum and to provide
customer service and support. [CLS] [SEP] please do read the privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

we automatically capture and keep the ip address of all server requests but
for no more than 30 days. [CLS] [SEP] you can access or delete your forum account (and
related data) in the âpreferencesâ panel at community.brave.com. [CLS] [SEP] see data
processing details for more information about what data we use and why. [CLS] [SEP]

## advertising brave to people using facebook, google, and twitter __

not track people on facebook, google, or twitter, or use any kind of in-app or
brave-server post-install tracking. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing detail. [CLS] [SEP] these ads link
to pages on a separate website run by a company called unbounce on braveâs
behalf, on servers based in the eu. [CLS] [SEP] see data processing details. [CLS] [SEP]

children under the age of 131 are not permitted to use the website, sign up
for email updates, join the community forum, or send brave any other

best to remove all related records. [CLS] [SEP]
