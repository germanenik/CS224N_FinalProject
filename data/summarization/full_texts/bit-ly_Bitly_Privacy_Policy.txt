# bitly privacy policy

#### effective date: december 4th, 2019

welcome to bitly. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy describes the policies and procedures of
bitly, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“bitly”, “we” or “us”) on the collection, use, security and
disclosure of personal information about you on
[https://bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) (the “site”) and the services,
features, content or applications offered by bitly (collectively with the
site, the “services”). [CLS] [SEP] it also describes your choices regarding use, access
and correction of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

##### scope

this privacy policy covers the treatment of the personal information gathered
by bitly when you use or access the services, or when you view or interact
with a bitly link (either our bit.ly links of one of our branded domains). [CLS] [SEP]
this privacy policy also covers bitly’s treatment of any information about you
that bitly’s customers share with bitly. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that
bitly does not own or control, including other companies’ websites, services
and applications (“third party services”) that you can access through the
services, such as facebook or twitter, or to individuals that bitly does not
manage or employ. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy
policies of those third party services. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to review the privacy
policies of any third party services you access. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information we collect

bitly may collect personal information about you as described in this privacy
policy when you (i) register for the site and the services, through your user
account with bitly, including registering through a third-party social
networking service (your “account”), (ii) use the services, or (iii) view or
interact with a bitly link (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded
domains) on a third-party website. [CLS] [SEP] we collect the following types of
information from you, some of which might be considered personal information
under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

 **when you register for a bitly account**  
when you create an account, we may collect personal information from you, such
as your name, phone number, company name, industry, job title, company size
and email address. [CLS] [SEP] if you create an account using your login from a third-
party account, such as google, facebook or twitter, we will access and collect
the personal information about you that the third-party account provides
(which is based on your privacy settings with the third-party account), so
that you can log into your account with us. [CLS] [SEP] we use your contact information to
send you information about our services and communicate with you about your
account, your activities on our site and services and policy changes. [CLS] [SEP] you may
unsubscribe from receiving certain types of these messages through your
account settings, although bitly reserves the right to contact you when we
believe it is necessary, such as for administrative and account management
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

some features of the services allow registered users to provide their own
content to the services, such as written descriptions of urls, comments,
images and video. [CLS] [SEP] unless you request deletion of your personal information as
described in this privacy policy, all content submitted by you to the services
may be retained by bitly, even after you terminate your account and may
continue to be shared by third parties, as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

 **when you create a bitly link**  
one feature of the services is the ability to create shortened uniform
resource locators (urls) of websites (“bitly link” or “bitlinks”). [CLS] [SEP] users can
create bitly links without registering for an account. [CLS] [SEP] when you create a bitly
link, bitly collects and stores both the original url and the shortened url
and, if you are logged in to your account, we will associate that information
with your account. [CLS] [SEP] bitly also collects and stores your ip address, your
location, which we derive from your ip address, the time and date on which you
shortened the original url, and if you share a bitly link on a social
networking platform, the name of the platform and your username on that
platform. [CLS] [SEP]

 **when you interact with a bitly link**  
bitly automatically collects personal information about the interaction (such
as clicks or views) with every bitly link created through the services (either
our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. [CLS] [SEP] this
information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the ip address and location
derived from the ip address; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii)
the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as browser type,
operating system, and language; (v) cookies, as described below, and mobile
advertising identifiers and (v) information about sharing of the bitly link on
third party services such as twitter and facebook (collectively, “bitly link
metrics”). [CLS] [SEP] as described in this policy, we use bitly link metrics to provide
the services, to understand and analyze how our services are used and to
identify trends, and to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or
unlawful activity. [CLS] [SEP] please see the “information we may share” section of this
privacy policy for a description of how we may share information we collect
when you create, view or interact with bitly links. [CLS] [SEP]

 **other information we automatically collect**  
when you visit the site, we automatically collect (i) your ip address and
location derived from the ip address; (ii) the referring websites or services;
(iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as browser
type, operating system, and language; and (v) cookie information. [CLS] [SEP] this type of
data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
individuals use parts of the site so that we can analyze and improve them. [CLS] [SEP]

we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. [CLS] [SEP] we use this
confirmation to improve our customer service. [CLS] [SEP]

bitly may use third-party apis and software development kits (“sdks”) to
provide certain functions in our services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **third party services**  
some features of the services allow you to share your content and bitly links
through your accounts with other companies such as facebook and twitter. [CLS] [SEP] if
you choose to connect bitly to such third party services, we may collect
information related to your use of those third party services, such as
authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your third party service
accounts. [CLS] [SEP] we will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection
of this information. [CLS] [SEP] we will only use that information for the specific reason
for which it was provided to us. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect information about how you
are using the services to interact with those connected third party services. [CLS] [SEP]
note that third party services may have the ability to restrict the
information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that
account. [CLS] [SEP]

to enable us to infer the location from the ip addresses of computers or
devices that visit our website or click, view or interact with bitly links as
described in this policy, we receive ip-based location information from our
third-party service provider. [CLS] [SEP] we also receive business contact information of
our business customer contacts and prospects from our third party service
provider. [CLS] [SEP]

 **cookies and other similar technologies**  
bitly and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends,
administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to
gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your
web browser when you access a website. [CLS] [SEP] your browser stores cookies in a manner
associated with each website you visit. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to enable our servers
to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit our site and
use the services through the web. [CLS] [SEP]

bitly cookies also allow bitly to track when you have clicked on a bitly link. [CLS] [SEP]
each click of a bitly link is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to
you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser and associated with
bitly. [CLS] [SEP] we may associate the unique identifier in our cookies with the other
information we automatically collect when you use the services, as described
above, including your ip address, bitly links you click, bitly links you
create, and information with your account if you have one. [CLS] [SEP]

most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance
of each new cookie in a variety of ways. [CLS] [SEP] if you disable cookies, you will not
be able to use some features of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

we partner with third parties to track utilization and behavior on our
websites, display advertising on our websites, and to manage our advertising
on other sites. [CLS] [SEP] our third-party partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixel
tags or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon
your browsing activities and interests. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to opt out of interest-
based advertising click [here ](http://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/)or if
located in the european union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by bitly only and does not cover
the use of cookies by any third party services. [CLS] [SEP] bitly does not control when or
how third parties place cookies on your computer, such as when you visit the
website from a bitly link. [CLS] [SEP] you can manage other companies’ cookies used for
online advertising by visiting the digital advertising alliance’s [consumer
choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). [CLS] [SEP]

 **opt-out mechanisms**  
you may ask bitly not to associate your web browser or ip address with visits
to the bitly.com website or bitly links that you create or click by clicking
on the appropriate links below. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like to opt-out of the bitly
links, please click on the opt-out choice for bitly links below. [CLS] [SEP] this will
install a cookie on your browser that instructs our servers not to associate
your ip address and browser with bitly links you create, click or view. [CLS] [SEP] if you
clear your cookies in your browser, you will need to click on the opt-out
choice again after each time you clear your cookies. [CLS] [SEP] to be clear, these
cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you
wish to have opted-out. [CLS] [SEP] cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile
applications. [CLS] [SEP] however, on many mobile devices, application users may limit
tracking via their device settings. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you use these opt-out
mechanisms, will still automatically collect the ip addresses of computers or
mobile devices that click on or create bitly links; we just won’t associate
them with your browser or bitly account. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies on bitly links: [click here](https://bit.ly/a/optout)

cookies on bitly.com: [click here](https://bitly.com/a/optout)

 **note regarding children**  
we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn
that we have collected personal information of a child under 13 (or older as
required by applicable law), we will take steps to delete such information
from our files as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

##### how we use information

we use the personal information we collect for a variety of administrative and
business purposes to:

  * operate our site and provide the services,
  * process and complete any transactions,
  * verify individual identity,
  * respond to inquiries, questions and comments and provide customer and technical support,
  * provide access to certain functionalities of our services,
  * personalize and improve the services and develop new products and services,
  * to communicate with our current and prospective customers concerning our services,
  * measure interest and engagement in our site and services,
  * monitor and analyze usage and trends of the site and services,
  * provide services to our customers to allow them to understand how you interact with our services and to help detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity,
  * comply with any legal obligations, and
  * enforce our terms and as otherwise described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

 **usage across devices**  
we may use the information we collect to make inferences that a unique
individual has created or interacted with bitly links on different devices so
that we can to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful
activity and analyze how users use our services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you created a
bitly link on a computer connected to your residential wifi network, and you
soon thereafter clicked on a bitly link on a mobile device connected to the
same wifi network, we may infer that a single individual created and clicked
on the bitly links because both events were associated with the same ip
address in the same time period. [CLS] [SEP]

 **other legitimate interests**  
we also may use personal information to pursue legitimate interests, such as
direct marketing, research (including marketing research), network and
information security, prevention of fraudulent, malicious and unlawful
activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide
personal information or allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information we share

the services are designed to help you share information with others. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, we provide services to our customers that use bitly link metrics. [CLS] [SEP] as
a result, some of the personal information generated through your use of the
services is shared publicly or with third parties as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

 **bitly links you create**  
much of your activity on and through the services is public by default. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, when you create a bitly link, the original urls you have shortened
and the corresponding bitly links are publicly available. [CLS] [SEP]

 **account information**  
where permitted by law, if you register a bitly account with an email address
on a domain owned by an organization, (for example, an employer or educational
institution where you have an email account), we may share your email address
and information about your account, such as the number of links you have
created, with that organization to explore the organization’s interest in
creating or managing an enterprise account or for related purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information we share with customers**  
we may share the personal information we collect as described in this privacy
policy with our customers. [CLS] [SEP] when you create a bitly link of one of our
enterprise customer’s sites, the enterprise customer is able to view the
unshortened original url, the date and time the bitly link was created, the
location where it was created as derived from your ip address, and aggregated
information about clicks and views of the bitly links, including the number of
times the bitly link was shared, whether or not it was viewed, comparison of
that bitly links performance to that of all bitly links pointing to the same
content, whether others are sharing a bitly link to the same content,
geographic regions where the content is being viewed, and identification of
social networks on which the bitly links appear. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may share
bitly link metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent
malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information you elect to share**  
when creating a bitly link, you can share that bitly link through third party
services. [CLS] [SEP] any information that you elect to distribute through third party
services, such as a social network post you create, may then become accessible
to users of those services. [CLS] [SEP] you can also access other third party services
through the services, for example by clicking on links in the statistics page
for a bitly link. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you review the terms of services and
privacy policies of such third party services that you access through the
services since bitly does not control and is not responsible for the privacy
practices of these third party services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information shared with service providers**  
we may employ and contract with third parties to perform certain tasks on our
behalf and under our direction (our “service providers”). [CLS] [SEP] we may need to share
information about you with our service providers in order to provide our
product with research and analytics on user behavior and to provide
advertising products and services to users, to process payments, and to
provide email marketing and support services. [CLS] [SEP] our agreements with these
service providers authorize them to use your information only as necessary to
provide services to us. [CLS] [SEP] transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by
the service agreements with our clients. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information disclosed pursuant to business transfers**  
we may transfer and/or provide information about our users in connection with
an acquisition, sale of company assets, or other situation where user
information would be transferred as one of our business assets. [CLS] [SEP] you will be
notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website. [CLS] [SEP]

in such a case, the acquirer of bitly may continue to use your information as
set forth in this policy or as otherwise allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information disclosed for the protection of bitly and others**  
bitly may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information it collects
when it has a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably necessary to (i)
comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, including process
from a governmental law enforcement or national security agency, (ii) enforce
the privacy policy or terms of service, including investigation of potential
violations hereof, (iii) detect, deter, prevent or otherwise address
malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity, (iv) respond to user support
requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of bitly, its users
and the public. [CLS] [SEP] this includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for protection from malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity. [CLS] [SEP]

 **information we share with your consent**  
we will share information about you when you instruct us to do so, such as
when you share bitly links or content with others through the services or if
we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular
manner and you provide such information (like sharing/posting it with a third-
party service). [CLS] [SEP]
