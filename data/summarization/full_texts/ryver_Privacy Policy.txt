# privacy policy

**last updated: january 7, 2019.**

ryver llc, a delaware corporation (“ryver” or “we” or “us” or “our”) is
committed to the protection of your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] we have established this privacy
statement (the ‘statement’) as a means of disclosing to you how we collect,
utilize, distribute, and protect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy
statement covers both the site www.ryver.com (the “site”) and the services and
applications (the “service”) that ryver llc provides. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this
privacy statement, “customer” shall mean any past, current, or prospective
customer of ryver, including any visitor to the site. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy statement
governs the manner in which ryver collects, uses, maintains and discloses
information collected from customers in connection with ryver’s site,
services, and applications. [CLS] [SEP] ryver is committed to safeguarding the information
its customers entrust to it. [CLS] [SEP] capitalized terms that are not defined in this
privacy policy have the meaning given them in our terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] by
accessing or using the service, you agree to this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### collecting and using information

ryver uses information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide you the
features and functionality of the service, to analyze how the service is used,
diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize
content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account,
monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and
demographic patterns, and track content and users as necessary to comply with
the digital millennium copyright act and other applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

**organization owners:** when a person signs up for a new ryver organization,
they are the owner, or primary administrator, of that organization. [CLS] [SEP] as an
organization owner, we may send you service, technical, and other
administrative emails, messages, and other types of communications  in lieu of
communication by postal mail. [CLS] [SEP] we may also contact you to inform you about
changes in our services, our services offerings, and important services-
related notices, such as security and fraud notices. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may need
to contact you for invoicing, account management, and similar reasons, and we
use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and
payments. [CLS] [SEP] these communications are considered part of the services and you may
not opt out of them. [CLS] [SEP] finally, we sometimes send emails about new product
features, promotional communications, or other news about ryver, which you can
opt out of receiving by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or by
writing to us at privacy@ryver.com. [CLS] [SEP]

**user profiles:** when a member or guest is invited to a ryver organization,
they fill out a user profile, which includes an email address, display name,
and other optional information. [CLS] [SEP] ryver will use the email address for directly
providing application services such as offline notifications. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we
may use the email address to send tips on using the product. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out
of receiving these emails by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or
by writing to us at privacy@ryver.com. [CLS] [SEP]

**error log data:** if you encounter an error in the ryver application, we
will provide a feedback form so you can report the problem to our customer
support. [CLS] [SEP] the error report includes the operating system, browser, device
information, and records the action that was being performed at the time the
error occurred. [CLS] [SEP] this information is used to help diagnose and solve the
customer problem. [CLS] [SEP]

**third party service integration:** ryver connects to third party services
such as google drive and dropbox, to facilitate document attachments and
google hangout integration. [CLS] [SEP] ryver connects to these services via oauth, and
does not directly capture or store your username or password for these
external services. [CLS] [SEP]

**ryver usage metrics:** ryver tracks application usage and stores it in a
metrics database, from which we create charts and spreadsheets for analysis,
allowing us to understand what parts of the ryver service are and are not
being used, and to what extent. [CLS] [SEP] data tracked includes number of invites,
number of teams created, number of chat messages, posts and comments, etc. [CLS] [SEP]
this data does not include actual content such as team names, message content,
or user names. [CLS] [SEP]

#### content

**your content:** when you post content into ryver, that content is private to
you and the other users in your ryver organization. [CLS] [SEP] who exactly can see what
content depends on the configuration of the teams and users in your
organization. [CLS] [SEP]

**ryver employees:** we have taken steps at ryver to ensure that your content
remains private. [CLS] [SEP] while we are a technology company providing a service, and
certain employees need to have access to customer data stores, we minimize
that access, even amongst the engineering staff. [CLS] [SEP] by taking advantage of
amazon’s identity and access management (iam) configuration
([https://aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)), we ensure that
most of the ryver employees are unable to access customer content data stores. [CLS] [SEP]

**disclosure:** as outlined in section 5 (acceptable user of ryver) in the
ryver terms of service, there may be certain cases where ryver is required to
access, remove, preserve, or disclose information as necessary to comply with
legal obligations and/or protect our users. [CLS] [SEP] as long as we are legally
permitted, we will provide notice of any situation where accessing content
becomes necessary. [CLS] [SEP] we will also request permission before accessing content to
provide customer support. [CLS] [SEP]

#### cookies and log files

when you use the service, we may send one or more “cookies” (a small data
file) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and assist ryver to
help you log in faster and improve your navigation through the site. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie
may convey anonymous information to us about how you browse the service. [CLS] [SEP] a
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so
that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. [CLS] [SEP]
persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser’s directions. [CLS] [SEP] a
session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. [CLS] [SEP] you
can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. [CLS] [SEP] however, certain features of the service may not function properly
if you disable the ability to accept cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

#### device identifiers and geo-location information

ryver does not currently collect precise gps information with our mobile
client. [CLS] [SEP] should that change in the future, we will update our privacy policy,
and take steps in the application to ensure that users are aware of such use
of location information in order to provide our service. [CLS] [SEP] should we add such a
feature in the future, please note that a device identifier or location data
does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

#### third party analytics

ryver may use third party analytics tools, such as google analytics, to help
understand use of the service or the ryver web site. [CLS] [SEP] many of these tools
collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request,
including cookies, and your ip address. [CLS] [SEP] these analytics tools also receive
this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy or
statement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### third party website remarketing

the ryver web site may use third-party remarketing services to advertise on
third-party websites (including google, facebook, and twitter) to previous
visitors to our site. [CLS] [SEP] these 3rd party sites use tracking cookies to serve ads
based on someone’s past visits to our website. [CLS] [SEP] this means we might continue to
show ads to you across the internet, specifically on the google content
network (gcn), facebook, and twitter. [CLS] [SEP] as always, we respect your privacy, and
we are not collecting any personally identifiable information through the use
of google’s, facebook’s, twitter’s, or any other 3rd party remarketing system. [CLS] [SEP]
you can set preferences for how google advertises to you using the google ad
preferences page
([http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/)). [CLS] [SEP]
if you do not want twitter to match your account to information shared by ad
partners to tailor ads for you, you can uncheck the box next to “promoted
content” in your account settings at any time. [CLS] [SEP] (read more
([https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405))
for details.) and, you can set preferences for how facebook advertises to you
by editing your privacy settings
([https://www.facebook.com/help/155389304528852](https://www.facebook.com/help/155389304528852))
on facebook. [CLS] [SEP]

#### protecting information

ryver makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our
customers. [CLS] [SEP] ryver has put stringent security procedures in place to protect
such information collected about our customers. [CLS] [SEP] we constantly monitor our
systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures. [CLS] [SEP] secure
sockets layer (“ssl”) connections are used to communicate to our system to
protect customer information as well as encrypting vital information that
customers input through the site. [CLS] [SEP] while ryver cannot guarantee that the
information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will
be 100% secure, we take security very seriously and follow industry best
practices. [CLS] [SEP] we have also paid for third party security audits in the past, and
will continue to do so in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

#### access to your personal data

we will display your personal identifiable information in your profile page
and elsewhere on the service according to the preferences you set for your
user account. [CLS] [SEP] any information you choose to provide should reflect how much
you want others to know about you. [CLS] [SEP] please carefully consider what information
you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. [CLS] [SEP] you can
review and revise your profile information at any time by going to **_my
settings > profile_**. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share or disclose your information with
your consent, for example, if you use a third party application to access your
account (see below). [CLS] [SEP] if you want to have your profile information completely
removed (for example, after you leave a ryver organization), please contact
[privacyshield@ryver.com](http://privacyshield@ryver.com) and we will delete
your personal information completely from our system. [CLS] [SEP]

#### service providers and third party services

ryver may share your personally identifiable information or certain content
with other third parties for the purpose of providing the service to you. [CLS] [SEP] if
we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this
privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

ryver may share your information with a third party application with your
consent, for example, when you choose to access our service through such an
application, and you provide that application with your ryver login
credentials. [CLS] [SEP] ryver is not responsible for what those third parties do with
your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that
it has a privacy policy or statement acceptable to you. [CLS] [SEP]

#### business transfers

as we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. [CLS] [SEP]
customers, email, and visitor information is generally one of the business
assets transferred in these types of transactions. [CLS] [SEP] we may also transfer or
assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures,
consolidations, mergers, or dissolution. [CLS] [SEP]

#### compliance with laws, law enforcement requests, and protection of ryver

ryver may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, law
enforcement, or subpoena. [CLS] [SEP] ryver may disclose your personal information if
ryver believes that it is reasonably necessary in order (i) to comply with
law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) to protect the safety of any person;
(iii) to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (iv) to protect
ryver’s rights or property. [CLS] [SEP]

#### children's privacy

protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. [CLS] [SEP] our service
is not directed to persons under 13. [CLS] [SEP] ryver does not knowingly collect or
solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly

have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without
verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that
information. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that we might have any information from or about a
child under 13, please contact us at
