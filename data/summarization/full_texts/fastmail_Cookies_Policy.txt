## types of cookies

a **persistent cookie** consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web

so), collect and analyze (on an anonymous basis) traffic and use of the
website, monitor the system and improve operating performance, for example,
store your preferences to enhance your subsequent visits. [CLS] [SEP] it will not be
automatically deleted when the browser is closed but is stored by the browser
and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user
before the expiry date). [CLS] [SEP]

a **session cookie** is like a persistent cookie, but is stored temporarily
during a browsing session and will expire at the end if the user session, when
the web browser is closed. [CLS] [SEP] the website will use a session cookie to manage
login and access to reserved features when you have not asked us to keep you
logged in past the end of your session. [CLS] [SEP]
