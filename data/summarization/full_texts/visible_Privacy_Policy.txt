# privacy policy

## effective date: september 22, 2020

visible values your business and is committed to protecting your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] this
privacy policy sets forth our policies and practices for the collection, use
and sharing of your information. [CLS] [SEP] visible is a member of the verizon family of
companies. [CLS] [SEP]



### i. [CLS] [SEP] collection of information

we collect information when you visit our websites, use our apps, contact us,
and when you subscribe to and use our wireless service. [CLS] [SEP]

**we collect information you provide directly to us.**  this includes personal
information (such as your name, email address, phone number, postal address,
social security number, and date of birth), a username and password, payment
information, and communications you send to us. [CLS] [SEP]

**we collect information when you use our service.**  this includes
information about the calls you make and receive, text messages you send and
receive, websites you visit, mobile applications you use, and wireless network
and device information, including location, internet protocol (ip) address and
connection speed, mobile telephone number, device and advertising identifiers,
browser type, and operating system. [CLS] [SEP] some visible devices include verizon-
provided system applications that collect information about network and device
conditions, which is used to secure and improve our network and services. [CLS] [SEP]

**we also collect information when you visit our sites and use our apps,
including through cookies and similar technology.**  this includes your ip
address, mobile number, device and advertising identifiers; browser and
platform type, operating system, connection speed and other attributes; pages
that you visit before and after visiting our sites; the date and time of your
visit; information about the links you click and pages you view within the
sites and screen records. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to automatically
collect this information. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are small bits of information that are
stored by your computer’s web browser. [CLS] [SEP] pixel tags are very small images or
small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear
gifs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a
description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information
from your computer or device. [CLS] [SEP] by using our websites and applications, you
consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

we also allow advertising companies to collect information about your activity
on our websites and in our app, for example through cookies, mobile ad
identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins, to help us
provide more relevant visible advertisements on our website and on others’
sites and apps. [CLS] [SEP] the use of information collected about your visits over time
and across different websites, apps and devices is known as “interest-based
advertising.” please see section v below for more information with regard to
the use of your information for these purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**we collect info when you contact us.**  when you contact us or we contact
you, we may monitor or record that communication for quality assurance,
training and security purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**we collect information about you from others.**  we may obtain information
about you from other sources, including from companies that collect consumer
information such as demographic and interest data. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you access
third-party services, such as facebook, google, or twitter, from our sites or
apps, to log into our sites or apps, or to share information about your
experience, we may collect information from these third-party services. [CLS] [SEP]



### ii. [CLS] [SEP] use of information

we use the information we collect to deliver service, to market to you, and
for other business purposes, including to:

  * fulfill your requests for products, services, information and customer support; 
  * determine products and services that may interest you and market them to you, including on visible sites and apps and on others’ sites, services, apps and devices as described in section v below; 
  * analyze the use of the sites, apps, and service for our purposes, such as product and service enhancements; 
  * research and develop new products and services;
  * authenticate you;
  * customize the content you see when you use our sites and apps; 
  * secure and improve our network and services; 
  * detect and prevent potentially prohibited, fraudulent or illegal activities and otherwise in accordance with our terms of use; and 
  * for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or with your consent. [CLS] [SEP] 



### iii. [CLS] [SEP] disclosure of information

we share information about you with vendors and partners who do work on our
behalf and for other business purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **authorized service providers and partners.**  we share your information with service providers and partners that help us with a variety of things, including development and delivery of our sites, apps and service. [CLS] [SEP] this includes services provided by others to help us with analytics, including [google analytics](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), which may include storing and accessing cookies and other information on your computer or wireless device. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **business transfers.**  we may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **legal purposes.**  we may disclose information (1) to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal claims or government inquiries and in emergencies such as those involving the danger of death or serious injury to any person; (2) to advance, protect or defend the rights, interests, property, safety, and security of visible, our affiliates, users, or the public; (3) to identify, protect against, and address unauthorized or unlawful use of our sites, apps or service, or our network; and (4) to outside auditors and regulators. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **collections.**  we may disclose information to collection agencies to obtain payment for visible-billed products and services. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **aggregated and de-identified information.**  we may aggregate or otherwise de-identify information and use it for our own purposes or share it with third parties for their own purposes. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **with your consent.**  we may share information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent. [CLS] [SEP] 

if you access third-party services, such as facebook, google, or twitter,
through our sites or apps, to log in or to share information about your
experience with others, these third-party services may be able to collect
information about you and they may notify your connections on the third-party
services about your use of the site or app, in accordance with their own
privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]



### iv. [CLS] [SEP] security

we use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft,
misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. [CLS] [SEP] you
should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the
internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent
secure. [CLS] [SEP]



### v. [CLS] [SEP] cookies, social media plugins and other website and app tools

you may see visible ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices, as well
as on visible sites and apps. [CLS] [SEP] these ads may be tailored for you based on
information that we or companies acting on our behalf collect on visible sites
and apps as well as other sites and apps where these advertising entities also
are present. [CLS] [SEP]

to accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access
cookies and similar technologies on browsers you use and access advertising
identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. [CLS] [SEP] information about your
activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present can
be combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience
advertisers wish to reach. [CLS] [SEP]

advertising that is customized based on information about your visits over
time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as “interest-
based” advertising. [CLS] [SEP] in accordance with the [digital advertising
alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) self-regulatory principles,
we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-
based advertising techniques to deliver interest-based ads on our sites and
apps as well as when they deliver visible ads on other sites. [CLS] [SEP] we also require
them to offer you an ability to [opt out](https://optout.aboutads.info/) of
this use of your information. [CLS] [SEP] you can visit the industry-wide [digital
advertising alliance opt-out page](https://optout.aboutads.info/) to learn
more and opt out. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, you will see an icon ![](/images/add-
choices.jpg) in or around online advertisements placed using interest-based
advertising techniques. [CLS] [SEP] you can click on the icon to learn more and opt out. [CLS] [SEP]
you can also opt out of the use of your device identifiers for interest-based
advertising by selecting “limit ad tracking” or “opt out of interest-based
ads” in your device settings. [CLS] [SEP]

visible websites may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and
widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or
third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-
ins and widgets. [CLS] [SEP]



### vi. [CLS] [SEP] your choices

you have choices about certain ways we use and share information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

**marketing.**  you have choices about receiving marketing from visible. [CLS] [SEP] if
you would like to be removed from visible’s email marketing list, you can opt-
out by following the unsubscribe instructions, usually found at the bottom of
the emails. [CLS] [SEP]

**website information used for interest based advertising**  you have a choice
about whether certain information collected on websites, including visible
sites, is used to customize advertisements you see on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] click on
this icon ![](/images/add-choices.jpg) in or around an advertisement and
follow the instructions for opting out. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, settings on your mobile
devices let you limit the collection and use of information from your device
for advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you can also set up cookie controls through many
browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] because each web browser is different, please consult the
instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section). [CLS] [SEP]
if you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the
functionality of our apps or sites may no longer be available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**do-not-track signals and similar mechanisms.**  some web browsers transmit
"do-not-track" signals to websites. [CLS] [SEP] because of differences in how web browsers
incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of
them. [CLS] [SEP] we currently do not take action in response to these signals. [CLS] [SEP]



### vii. [CLS] [SEP] international users

our sites, apps and service are designed for and targeted to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] audiences
and are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] we
make no representation that our apps, sites or service are operated in
accordance with the laws or regulations of any other nation. [CLS] [SEP] by using our
apps, sites or service and providing us with information, you understand and
agree that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers
located outside your resident jurisdiction and, to the extent you are a
resident of a country other than the united states, that you consent to the
transfer of such data to the united states for processing by us in accordance
with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]



### viii. [CLS] [SEP] changes to the privacy policy

we may update this privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] when we update the
privacy policy, we will revise the “effective date” date above and post the
new privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

california privacy rights

**california consumer privacy act**

the california consumer privacy act, or ccpa, gives you specific rights as a
california resident. [CLS] [SEP]  the law provides you with the right to know what
information we collect about you and how we use it, to access and delete that
information within certain limitations, to tell us not to sell personal
information about you, and to not be discriminated against for invoking these
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**your right to know**

we describe the personal information we collect and how we use it in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] the information we collect varies depending on your
interactions with us and the products and services you use. [CLS] [SEP] the california law
requires us to let you know about the categories of personal information we
collect and use. [CLS] [SEP] categories of personal information we collect include:
identifiers; records of products and services you purchase or use and how you
use them; financial data; website, network or device activity; and other
information that identifies or can be reasonably associated or linked with
you. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect personal information when you interact with us and use our products
and services, from certain [third-party sources](javascript:void\(0\);) and
from our network and the devices you use. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information for business
and commercial purposes as they are defined by the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] service providers we
use to do work on our behalf (also called vendors in other sections of this
privacy policy) may also use information for the same purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we share
information with service providers as necessary for them to perform work for
us. [CLS] [SEP] they are required to protect the information they receive from us or
collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow. [CLS] [SEP]

  

“business and commercial purposes” includes providing services to you;
communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your
experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising;
debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses;
research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes. [CLS] [SEP] examples and
additional detail about these types of uses can be found in our privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**your rights to access**

you have the right to request access to specific pieces and categories of
personal information we collected about you in the past 12 months. [CLS] [SEP] you can do
this by accessing our data and privacy portal and via the email address
provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**your right to delete**

requests that visible delete your personal information are subject to
exemptions under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] we will retain certain information required for
security, legal, or other business or commercial purposes only as long as
necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes and then securely
delete it. [CLS] [SEP]

all personal information that visible collects and retains is used to provide
service to you and for related purposes as described in our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if
you make a request to delete this information, visible will not be able to
continue providing service to you. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**your right to say “do not sell”**

the ccpa gives you the right to say no to the sale of personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not sell information that personally identifies you such as your name,
telephone number, mailing address or email address. [CLS] [SEP] we allow verizon media and
third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity
on our website and in our app, for example through cookies and similar
technologies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network
plugins. [CLS] [SEP] these ad entities use information they collect to help us provide
more relevant visible advertisements and for other advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] this
activity may be considered a sale under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] visit the [digital
advertising alliance's consumer choices](https://youradchoices.com/control)
page to learn more about how you can limit this type of advertising. [CLS] [SEP] app users
can opt out by using your device settings to “limit ad tracking” (for ios
devices) or “opt out of ads personalization” (on android devices). [CLS] [SEP]

**your right to not be discriminated against**

we will not discriminate against you if you exercise any rights described in
this section. [CLS] [SEP] we will not denyg goods or services, charge different prices or
rates for goods or services, or provide you a different level or quality of
goods and services. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right to receive information about the
financial incentives that we offer to you. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**where to exercise your rights**

you or your authorized agent can exercise your right to access or delete data
by:

  * visit the visible [data and privacy portal](/legal/data-and-privacy-portal "privacy portal")
  * send an email to  [privacy@visible.com![](https://jira.visible.com/../images/icons/mail_small.gif)](mailto:privacy@visible.com "follow link")

we require you to verify your identity using the processes described in the
portal before we fulfill your request. [CLS] [SEP]

you can authorize an agent to exercise your california privacy rights on your
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] to designate a california business as your agent, use our data and
privacy portal to “assign and manage your authorized agent.” to designate an
individual as your authorized agent or someone to whom you have granted a
power of attorney to exercise your privacy rights, send their name, physical
address, and email address to [privacy@visible.com](mailto:privacy@visible.com
"follow link") we may require additional proof that you granted the authority. [CLS] [SEP]

  

if you have questions about your rights under ccpa, email us at
[privacy@visible.com](mailto:privacy@visible.com "follow link")

**other california privacy rights**

california customers may request, once per year, that we disclose the identity
of any third parties with whom we have shared personal information for the
third parties’ direct marketing purposes within the previous calendar year,
along with the type of personal information disclosed. [CLS] [SEP]

california residents under age 18 who are registered users of online sites,
services or applications may request and obtain removal of content or
information they have publicly posted. [CLS] [SEP] your request should include a detailed
description of the specific content or information to be removed. [CLS] [SEP] please be
aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal
of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or
require removal in certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

nevada privacy rights

nevada law allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information by
online service providers such as website operators. [CLS] [SEP] nevada law defines “sale”
as the exchange of certain personally identifiable information for money,
where the recipient also intends to sell that information. [CLS] [SEP] personally
identifiable information includes name, address, phone number, social security
number, or any identifier that can be used to contact a consumer
electronically. [CLS] [SEP] visible does not currently sell personal information as
defined by nevada law and has no plans to start. [CLS] [SEP] if visible ever starts
selling such personal information, current visible customers will be opted
out. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions, please contact us at
[privacy@visible.com![](https://jira.visible.com/../images/icons/mail_small.gif)](mailto:privacy@visible.com
"follow link"). [CLS] [SEP]

maine broadband customer privacy rights

the maine broadband internet access service customer privacy act gives
additional privacy rights to current and former subscribers of mass market
broadband internet access service in maine, as well as applicants. [CLS] [SEP] the maine
law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or share
information we have about you and requires that we provide you with a notice
of your rights and our obligations under this law. [CLS] [SEP] we do this in this section. [CLS] [SEP]

the maine law also requires us to take reasonable measures to protect your
customer personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we describe this in an earlier section of this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your
broadband customer personal information (personally identifying information
about a customer or information from a customer’s use of broadband internet
access service) except with affirmative consent or for the following purposes
allowed under the maine law: to provide and maintain your broadband services;
market and advertise our communications-related services to you; comply with
lawful court orders; bill and collect; protect users from fraudulent, abusive,
or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or provide location
information in response to certain emergency situations.. [CLS] [SEP]

the maine law also provides you with a right to opt-out of any use or sharing
of data that is not customer personal information under the law. [CLS] [SEP] at this time,
we do not collect information about you as a broadband customer that is not
customer personal information. [CLS] [SEP] if we begin collecting such information in the
future, we will give you the right to opt out of its use and sharing. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not refuse to provide you with broadband service, charge you a
penalty, or offer you a discount based on whether you agree that we can use or
share your broadband customer personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

we use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft,
misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. [CLS] [SEP] you
should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the
internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent
secure. [CLS] [SEP]



### v. [CLS] [SEP] your choices

you have choices about certain ways we use and share information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

**customer proprietary network information. [CLS] [SEP]  **visible customers may choose to
limit the use and sharing of customer propriety network information (or
“cpni”) among visible’s affiliates, which includes the verizon family of
companies, for the purpose of marketing communications-related services that
are different from those you currently have. [CLS] [SEP] cpni is information that relates
to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount
of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or
interconnected voice over internet protocol (voip) services. [CLS] [SEP] federal law
governs our use and sharing of cpni. [CLS] [SEP] notice about visible’s use and sharing of
cpni and the choices you have may be provided in your monthly statement or in
other ways. [CLS] [SEP] to opt out, log in to your account and go to “privacy” in your
account in the visible app or online at
[www.visible.com/account/privacy](/account/privacy/ "follow link"). [CLS] [SEP]

**marketing. [CLS] [SEP]  **you have choices about receiving marketing from visible. [CLS] [SEP] if
you would like to be removed from visible’s email marketing list, you can opt-
out by following the unsubscribe instructions, usually found at the bottom of
the emails. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies. [CLS] [SEP]  **you may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your
web browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] because each web browser is different, please consult
the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help”
section). [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some
of the functionality of our apps or sites may no longer be available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**do-not-track signals and similar mechanisms. [CLS] [SEP]  **some web browsers transmit
"do-not-track" signals to websites. [CLS] [SEP] because of differences in how web browsers
incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of
them. [CLS] [SEP] we currently do not take action in response to these signals. [CLS] [SEP]



### vi. [CLS] [SEP] california privacy rights

we are required to disclose information, upon request, to our california
customers and to allow california residents under age 18 who are registered
users to request removal of information they have publicly posted. [CLS] [SEP]

a business subject to california civil code section 1798.83 is required to
disclose to its california customers, upon request, the identity of any third
parties to whom the business has disclosed personal information within the
previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed,
for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] please note that under
california law, businesses are only required to respond to a customer request
once during any calendar year. [CLS] [SEP]

a business subject to california business and professions code section 22581
must allow california residents under age 18 who are registered users of
online sites, services or applications to request and obtain removal of

a detailed description of the specific content or information to be removed. [CLS] [SEP]
please be aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive
removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not
permit or require removal in certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] you can contact us by
email at

### vii. [CLS] [SEP] nevada privacy rights

nevada customers can opt out of the potential future sale of their personal
information

visible doesn’t sell personal information today and we don’t have plans to
start. [CLS] [SEP] however, nevada customers can opt out now should we ever change our
practices and offer information for sale in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

nevada law defines “sale” as the exchange of certain customer information for
money, where the recipient also intends to sell that information. [CLS] [SEP] customer
information includes name, address, phone number, ssn, or any identifier that
can be used to contact you electronically. [CLS] [SEP]

to opt out of the potential future sale of your personal information, send an
email to
[privacy@visible.com![](https://jira.visible.com/../images/icons/mail_small.gif)](mailto:privacy@visible.com
"privacy@visible.com"). [CLS] [SEP]

agree that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers
located outside your resident jurisdiction and, to the extent you are a
resident of a country other than the united states, that you consent to the
transfer of such data to the united states for processing by us in accordance
with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

privacy policy, we will revise the “effective date” date above and post the
new privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
