it is your responsibility to keep your personal information current and
accurate at all times. [CLS] [SEP]

**renewals**

domain name. [CLS] [SEP] for the purpose of facilitating any such change request, and in
accordance with icann's [change of registrant
policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en),

****4 . [CLS] [SEP] dbp's rights to deny, suspend, terminate service and to disclose your
personal information** **

you understand and agree that dbp has the absolute right and power, in its
sole discretion and without any liability to you whatsoever, to:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] cancel the privacy service (which means that your information will be available in the "whois" directory) and/or reveal your name and personal information that you provided to dbp
    1. [CLS] [SEP] when required by law, in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or in the interest of public safety;
    2. [CLS] [SEP] to comply with legal process served upon dbp or in response to a reasonable threat of litigation against dbp (as determined by dbp in its sole and absolute discretion); or
    3. [CLS] [SEP] to comply with icann rules, policies, or procedures. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] resolve any and all third party claims, whether threatened or made, arising out of your use of a domain name for which dbp is the registrant listed in the "whois" directory on your behalf; or

    6. [CLS] [SEP] if the domain name for which dbp is the registrant on your behalf violates or infringes a third party's trademark, trade name or other legal rights; and
    7. [CLS] [SEP] if it comes to dbp's attention that you are using dbp's services in a manner (as determined by dbp in its sole and absolute discretion) that:
      * is illegal, or promotes or encourages illegal activity;
      * promotes, encourages, or engages in the exploitation of children, or any activity related to the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (csam);
      * promotes, encourages or engages in terrorism, violence against people, animals, or property;
      * promotes, encourages or engages in any spam or other unsolicited bulk email, or computer or network hacking or cracking;
      * violates the ryan haight online pharmacy consumer protection act of 2008 or similar legislation, or promotes, encourages or engages in the sale or distribution of prescription medication without a valid prescription;
      * infringes on the intellectual property rights of another user or any other person or entity;
      * violates the privacy or publicity rights of another user or any other person or entity, or breaches any duty of confidentiality that you owe to another user or any other person or entity;
      * interferes with the operation of dbp services;
      * contains or installs any viruses, worms, bugs, trojan horses or other code, files or programs designed to, or capable of, disrupting, damaging or limiting the functionality of any software or hardware; or
      * contains false or deceptive language, or unsubstantiated or comparative claims, regarding dbp or its services. [CLS] [SEP]

you further understand and agree that if dbp is named as a defendant in, or
investigated in anticipation of, any legal or administrative proceeding
arising out of your domain name registration or your use of dbp's services,
your private registration service may be canceled, which means the domain name
registration will revert back to you and your identity will therefore be
revealed in the whois directory as registrant. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
in the event:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] dbp takes any of the actions set forth in subsection i, ii, or iii above or section 5; and/or
  2. [CLS] [SEP] you elect to cancel dbp's services for any reason --

neither dbp nor your registrar will refund any fees paid by you whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]

****5 . [CLS] [SEP] communications forwarding** **

**a. [CLS] [SEP] correspondence forwarding**

inasmuch as dbp's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the
whois directory, you agree dbp will review and forward communications
addressed to your domain name that are received via email, certified or
traceable courier mail (such as ups, fedex, or dhl), or first class u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
postal mail. [CLS] [SEP] you specifically acknowledge dbp will not forward to you first
class postal mail (other than legal notices), "junk" mail or other unsolicited
communications (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or
telephone), and you further authorize dbp to either discard all such
communications or return all such communications to sender unopened. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
to waive any and all claims arising from your failure to receive
communications directed to your domain name but not forwarded to you by dbp. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**b. [CLS] [SEP] email forwarding**  
  
the whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name
registration. [CLS] [SEP] when you purchase a private domain registration, dbp creates a
private email address for that domain name, "@domainsbyproxy.com". [CLS] [SEP] thereafter,
when messages are sent to that private email address, dbp handles them
according to the email preference you selected for that particular domain
name. [CLS] [SEP] you have three (3) email preferences from which to choose. [CLS] [SEP] you can elect
to:  

  1. [CLS] [SEP] have all of the messages forwarded;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] have all of the messages filtered for spam and then forwarded; or
  3. [CLS] [SEP] have none of the messages forwarded. [CLS] [SEP]

  
as with all communications, you agree to waive any and all claims arising from
your failure to receive email directed to your domain name but not forwarded
to you by dbp. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] notifications regarding correspondence and your obligation to respond**  
when dbp receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices
addressed to your domain name, in most cases, dbp will attempt to forward the
mail to you via email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not respond to the dbp email and/or the
correspondence dbp has received regarding your domain name registration
concerns a dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition,
dbp may immediately reveal your identity and/or cancel the dbp private
registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s) in
question. [CLS] [SEP] this means the whois directory will revert to displaying your name,
postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to dbp. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**d. [CLS] [SEP] additional administrative fees**  
  
dbp reserves the right to charge you reasonable "administrative fees" or
"processing fees" for (i) tasks dbp may perform outside the normal scope of
its services, (ii) additional time and/or costs dbp may incur in providing its
services, and/or (iii) your non-compliance with the agreement (as determined
by dbp in its sole and absolute discretion). [CLS] [SEP] typical administrative or
processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service
issues that require additional personal time and attention; (ii) disputes that
require accounting or legal services, whether performed by dbp staff or by
outside firms retained by dbp; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees,
including the cost of services, incurred by dbp as the result of chargebacks
or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or payment method
processor. [CLS] [SEP] these administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the
payment method you have on file with your registrar. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes
place relating to or arising out of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

****6 . [CLS] [SEP] limitations of liability** **

under no circumstances shall dbp be liable for any direct, indirect,
incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages for any reason
whatsoever related to this agreement, your domain name registration, dbp's
services, use or inability to use the dbp website or the materials and content
of the website or any other websites linked to the dbp website or your
provision of any personally identifiable information to dbp or any third
party. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is
based on contract, tort, warranty, negligence, strict liability or any other
basis, even if dbp has been advised of the possibility of such damages or such
damages were reasonably foreseeable. [CLS] [SEP] because certain jurisdictions do not
permit the limitation or elimination of liability for consequential or
incidental damages, dbp's liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to
the smallest amount permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you further understand and agree that dbp disclaims any loss or liability
resulting from:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] the inadvertent disclosure or theft of your personal information;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] access delays or interruptions to our website or the websites of our affiliated registrars;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] data non-delivery of mis-delivery between you and dbp;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the failure for whatever reason to renew a private domain name registration;
  5. [CLS] [SEP] the unauthorized use of your dbp account or any of dbp's services;
  6. [CLS] [SEP] errors, omissions or misstatements by dbp;
  7. [CLS] [SEP] deletion of, failure to store, failure to process or act upon email messages forwarded to either you or your private domain name registration;
  8. [CLS] [SEP] processing of updated information regarding your dbp account; and/or
  9. [CLS] [SEP] any act or omission caused by you or your agents (whether authorized by you or not). [CLS] [SEP]

****7 . [CLS] [SEP] indemnity** **

you agree to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless dbp, its parent
companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, directors, officers
and employees and your registrar, from and against any and all claims,
demands, liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, arising out of or related in any way to this agreement, the

your use of your domain name registration, and/or disputes arising in

in the unlikely event you lose your domain name registration to a third party
solely as a result of dbp's willful misconduct, your registrar (the
"indemnifying party") will indemnify and hold you harmless against any losses,
damages or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
claim, action, proceeding, suit or demand arising out of or related to the
loss of your domain name registration. [CLS] [SEP] such indemnification obligations under
this section 10(e) are conditioned upon the following:  
  

  1. [CLS] [SEP] that you promptly give both dbp and the indemnifying party written notice of the claim, demand, or action and provide reasonable assistance to the indemnifying party, at its cost and expense, in connection therewith, and
  2. [CLS] [SEP] that the indemnifying party has the right, at its option, to control and direct the defense to any settlement of such claim, demand, or action. [CLS] [SEP]

  
  
any notice concerning indemnification shall, with respect to dbp, be sent in
accordance with section 10(c) of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to your
registrar, notices regarding indemnification should be sent in accordance with
the notification provisions contained in your registrar's domain name
registration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] term of agreement; survival**  
  
the terms of this agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as
dbp is the registrant for any domain name on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] sections 5
(communications forwarding), 6 (limitation of liability), 7 (indemnity), 8
(warranty disclaimer) and 10 (miscellaneous provisions) shall survive any
termination or expiration of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]
