  * **mobile opt out:** your mobile devices may offer settings that enable you to make choices about the collection, use, or transfer of mobile app information for behavioral advertising. [CLS] [SEP] you may also opt-out of certain tracking tools on mobile devices by installing the daa’s appchoice app on your mobile device (for itunes, visit https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8, for android, visit https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daa.appchoices&hl;=en). [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4228, https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en or http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device, as applicable. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **do not track:** your browser may offer you a “do not track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. [CLS] [SEP] the service does not support do not track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the service and after you leave our service. [CLS] [SEP] we collect certain persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the service. [CLS] [SEP] because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data (only for analytic and internal purposes), your selection of the “do not track” option provided by your mobile browser will not have any effect on our collection of analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier. [CLS] [SEP]

please note the following with respect to opting out of behavioral
advertising:

  * some opt-out features are cookie-based, meaning that when you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” cookie will be placed on your computer or other device indicating that you do not want to receive behavioral advertising from certain companies. [CLS] [SEP] if you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. [CLS] [SEP]
  * opting-out of behavioral advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. [CLS] [SEP] it only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests. [CLS] [SEP] you may continue to see ads on and about the service. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information about these rights please see refer to the “your privacy
rights” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] security and storage of data

**security:** genius cares about the security of your information and uses
commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards
to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, genius uses industry standard secure sockets layer (ssl) technology
to allow for the encryption of personal data you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP] you should
help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password
and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and
browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. [CLS] [SEP] in
the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of
a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the
situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information
may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any
applicable laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

**data retention:** we retain personal data about you for a period of time
consistent with the original purpose of collection, whether or not you have an
account with us. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we may retain your personal data for as long as
you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you the
service, and for a reasonable period of time afterward. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases we
retain personal data for longer, if doing so is necessary to pursue our
legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, enforce our agreements, or
as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. [CLS] [SEP]
afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form
but not in a way that would identify you personally. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to change or
delete your profile and personal data, you can contact us at
privacy@genius.com, and we will amend or delete your personal data within a
reasonable time after your request, if feasible, or if you reside in the eu,
as set forth in section 8 below. [CLS] [SEP] because of the crowd-sourced and
collaborative nature of our service, however, we will not be able to delete
content you post to public areas of our site. [CLS] [SEP] we may be able to anonymize your
information such that you will no longer be reasonably identifiable. [CLS] [SEP]

### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] transfers of personal data

the service is hosted and operated in the united states (“u.s.”) through
genius and its service providers, and if you are not located in the u.s., laws
in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] may differ from the laws where you are located. [CLS] [SEP] by using the
service, you acknowledge that any personal data about you, regardless of
whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to
genius in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and will be hosted on u.s. [CLS] [SEP] servers, and you authorize
genius to transfer, store and process your information to and in the u.s., and
possibly other countries. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby consent to the transfer of your data to
the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] pursuant to eu-us privacy shield framework, the details of which are
further set forth below. [CLS] [SEP]

genius has been certified to the eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework set forth by

data transferred from the eu. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about the privacy shield
program, and to view genius’s certification, please visit
www.privacyshield.gov. [CLS] [SEP] genius is committed to the privacy shield principles of
(1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security,
(5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse,
enforcement and liability, with respect to all personal data received from
within the eu in reliance on the privacy shield. [CLS] [SEP] the privacy shield principles
require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing
personal data on our behalf fails to comply with these privacy shield
principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving
rise to any alleged damage). [CLS] [SEP] genius’s compliance with the privacy shield is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal trade
commission. [CLS] [SEP]

please contact us at gdpr@genius.com with any questions or concerns relating
to our privacy shield certification. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not receive timely
acknowledgment of your privacy shield-related complaint from us, or if we have
not resolved your complaint, you can also resolve a privacy shield-related
complaint through jams, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in
the united states. [CLS] [SEP] you can visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield
for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. [CLS] [SEP] under certain
conditions, you can also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for
complaints not resolved by other means. [CLS] [SEP]
