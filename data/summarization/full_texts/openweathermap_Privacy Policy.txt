by law). [CLS] [SEP] you can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate
interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific

you have the right to:

**request access** o your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject
access request”). [CLS] [SEP] this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we
hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. [CLS] [SEP]

**request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP] this
enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
provide to us. [CLS] [SEP]

**request erasure** of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this enables you to ask us to
delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing
to process it. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with
local law. [CLS] [SEP] note, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful
where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a
task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the
area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. [CLS] [SEP]

**object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a
legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about
your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this
ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. [CLS] [SEP] you
also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for
direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
rights and freedoms. [CLS] [SEP]

**request restriction of processing** of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this enables you
to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our
use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you
need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
grounds to use it. [CLS] [SEP]

**request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. [CLS] [SEP] we
will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a
structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. [CLS] [SEP] note that this right only
applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us
to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. [CLS] [SEP]

**withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process
your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. [CLS] [SEP] if you withdraw your
consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. [CLS] [SEP] we
will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. [CLS] [SEP]
