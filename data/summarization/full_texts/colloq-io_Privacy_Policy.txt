## information sharing

### server / hosting

we use [digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) inc. [CLS] [SEP] (101 avenue of the
americas 10th floor, new york, ny 10013, united states of america) as a
service provider to host our server infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] we use
[ovh](https://www.ovh.de/) gmbh, dudweiler landstraße 5, 66123 saarbrücken,
germany to ensure our service availability. [CLS] [SEP] while we are currently hosting our
services in frankfurt, germany, we may expand to other server locations
offered by our hosting service providers in order to ensure the reliablity and
performance of our service around the world. [CLS] [SEP]

### emails

we will occasionally use your name and/or email address to send you
newsletters or transactional emails. [CLS] [SEP] **we won’t send you newsletters unless
you[signed up for them](/newsletter/subscriber;create).** we may send you
transactional emails in order to fulfill our service agreement and provide you
the requested information. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt-out of any marketing or other emails
not required to operate our service safely and in compliance to laws at any
time via the ‘unsubscribe’ link in each email. [CLS] [SEP] for sending transactional
emails and newsletters we use [amazon ses](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) by
amazon web services, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (410 terry ave north, seattle, wa 98109-5210, united
states of america), currently using their only european ses location (ireland)
for which their terms and conditions and their privacy policy applies. [CLS] [SEP]

### analytics

**we do not use any third party analytics or tracking software.** the only
data we collect are log files generated by our web server which may contain
personal information such as your ip address, referrer, browser details and
network provider information. [CLS] [SEP] by default we do not store this information but
we reserve the right to collect the data to ensure the reliability, security
and continued availability of our service. [CLS] [SEP]

### local storage information

we use local storage information such as (session) cookies to allow our users
to sign in and to optionally “remember” the login data or to save generic
preferences of users. [CLS] [SEP] our payment provider ([stripe payments europe,
limited](https://stripe.com), 1 grand canal street lower, grand canal dock,
dublin, ireland) uses cookies for the payment process on our site. [CLS] [SEP]

### third-party platform integrations

we provide several platform integrations to show external content on our
platform. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, the services’ terms of service and privacy policy do
apply. [CLS] [SEP] please review their terms and privacy policies when using a third-party
service on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t own or control these integrations and and
while trying to limit data collection where we can, we don’t exactly know what
personal information these third-parties might collect and how they use it. [CLS] [SEP]

in case do-not-track (dnt) is enabled while attempting to view external
content, we show a privacy warning that users can explicitly agree to. [CLS] [SEP] with
dnt enabled, external services default to being inaccessible. [CLS] [SEP]

### financial transactions

for any financial transaction we use [stripe payments europe,
limited](https://stripe.com), 1 grand canal street lower, grand canal dock,
dublin, ireland. [CLS] [SEP] the service provider will gather and process personal data
required to process payments. [CLS] [SEP] for payments and related data to be processed
and get verified, the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the payment
provider apply. [CLS] [SEP] **credit card numbers are never shared with us** , and thus,
never stored by us. [CLS] [SEP]

## security

even though we would like to, we can’t promise you absolute security until the
end of times. [CLS] [SEP] what we can guarantee, is that we keep your personal information
as safe as possible and are doing our best to protect all data stored on
colloq. [CLS] [SEP] in case we will become aware of any sort of data breach, we will
inform all affected users promptly. [CLS] [SEP]

## updates to the privacy policy

we may update this privacy policy in the future. [CLS] [SEP] if we make any material
changes we will notify you by email (using the email address stored in your
account) or by displaying a notice banner on our site before the changes
become effective. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically
to ensure you are aware of the latest information. [CLS] [SEP] for your convenience we
will publish a changelog describing the latest changes to the privacy policy
below. [CLS] [SEP]
