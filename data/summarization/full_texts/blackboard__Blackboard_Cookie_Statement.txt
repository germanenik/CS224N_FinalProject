this cookie statement describes how we use cookies and how you can control
them. [CLS] [SEP] please read our [privacy statement](/privacy_statement) for more
information on how we use your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

## what are cookies & how do they work?

cookies are small text files placed on your device to make sure our websites
work efficiently and seamlessly and to perform certain functions. [CLS] [SEP] they are
unique to your account or your browser. [CLS] [SEP] the website sends information to the
browser, which then creates a text file. [CLS] [SEP] every time you go back to the same
website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server. [CLS] [SEP]
cookies cannot access, read, or modify any other data on your computer. [CLS] [SEP]

learn more about cookies at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. [CLS] [SEP]

## how we use cookies

we use cookies and similar technologies on our websites, as almost all
websites do. [CLS] [SEP] we also use cookies when you access some of our products and
services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and
settings, authenticate and log you in, provide you with a personalized
experience, keep our websites secure, and analyze how our websites and online
services are performing. [CLS] [SEP]

the following table provides information on the types of cookies we use for
our websites and products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

types of cookies blackboard uses type of cookies | description  
---|---  
sign-in and authentication | these cookies help us authenticate you, keep you
signed in, and personalize the services where you use websites and services
with sign-in, such as behind the blackboard and blackboard learn. [CLS] [SEP]  
preferences and settings | these cookies help us remember your settings and
preferences and deliver a personalized experience even if you are not logged
in. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we can store which language you prefer. [CLS] [SEP] we also use such
cookies to help you fill out forms and surveys more easily. [CLS] [SEP] we use third-party
cookies such as eloqua, acquia lift, and getsitecontrol for these purposes. [CLS] [SEP]  
security | security cookies support our security features and help us detect
malicious activities. [CLS] [SEP]  
analytics | we use blackboard and third-party cookies such as google analytics
and siteimprove to gather information about user activities and performance. [CLS] [SEP]
this helps us analyze and improve the performance of our websites. [CLS] [SEP] it also
lets us understand, improve, and research how our products and services are
used and what type of devices you use to access them. [CLS] [SEP] the information we
receive from these third-party providers is de-identified, meaning we cannot
track it back to you. [CLS] [SEP] for google analytics we have enabled ip anonymization to
anonymize your ip address. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about ip anonymization in google
analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052). [CLS] [SEP]  
social sharing | on some of our websites we use buttons and cookies from
facebook, twitter, linkedin, and other social media services that allow you to
share content via their services if you are a member and signed in. [CLS] [SEP] these
social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your
visit to our websites, and they may set a cookie or employee other tracking
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] your interactions with those features are governed by the
privacy policies of the social media companies. [CLS] [SEP] please read their privacy
statements and cookie policies to understand how they use your information. [CLS] [SEP]

information on our pages (such as in a web form), we will link this
information to the information stored on the cookie. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information
to personalize your experience on our websites and to make sure we are
communicating with you in the most relevant way possible. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we also use third-party cookies from services such as google adwords, facebook
business, linkedin campaign manager, and twitter ads. [CLS] [SEP] this allows those
services to show you relevant ads and campaigns from us in their environment
when you previously visited one of our websites. [CLS] [SEP] we also receive information
from some of these services about which of our ads or campaigns you have
interacted with. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about how we use these third-party cookies for
online and interest-based advertising and your choices with respect to these
activities in the "client engagement & marketing" section in our privacy
statement](/privacy_statement#engagement). [CLS] [SEP]
