[CLS] [SEP] this limitation of liability is intended to apply without regard to whether other provisions of this agreement have been breached or have proven ineffective or if a remedy fails of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow for limited liability or exclusion of implied warranties, so not all of the above limitations may apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and understand that the disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the agreement between the parties hereto, that the parties have relied upon such disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability, and that absent such disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability, the terms and conditions of this agreement would be substantially different.

[CLS] [SEP]
  14. [CLS] [SEP]  **governing law.** this agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware without regard to any conflict of laws principles. [CLS] [SEP]
  15. [CLS] [SEP]  **dispute resolution/arbitration agreement.** you and company agree to resolve any disputes between us in accordance with this section 15 (“ **arbitration agreement** ”). [CLS] [SEP] if you have any dispute with company, please contact the company using the contact information provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] we will do our best to address your concerns and we will attempt to resolve any disputes with you amicably. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided herein, you and the company agree that we will resolve any disputes between us that we cannot resolve as provided above through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] all controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and the company relating to the services or this agreement (each a “ **claim** ”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of jams (“ **jams** ”). [CLS] [SEP] if jams is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative dispute resolution provider (“ **adr provider** ”) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] for any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the jams (or adr provider, as applicable), you and the company must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. [CLS] [SEP] if the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the jams rules (or adr provider rules, as applicable), and the parties will attempt to agree on a mutually convenient location for the hearing. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing within thirty (30) days of their initial discussion, the hearing will take place in arlington, virginia. [CLS] [SEP] if you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the company will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. [CLS] [SEP] in the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. [CLS] [SEP] you and the company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you and the company retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] neither you nor the company may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim. [CLS] [SEP] claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator can decide only your and/or the company’s individual claims.
