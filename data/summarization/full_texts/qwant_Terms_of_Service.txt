the purpose of the present special conditions of use (henceforth known as scu)

the boards service can be accessed through the site https://boards.qwant.com. [CLS] [SEP]
the use of this service is done in full compliance with [qwantâs general
terms of service](https://about.qwant.com/fr/legal/cgu/qwant-search/)â and is

and/or its use.â you will be informed of these changes by email or any other
means of acquiring information under services prior to their entry into force. [CLS] [SEP]

access to boards is reserved for people over the age of 18.â minors can only

### description of the boards service

giving qwant a social dimension, boards is a service that, following
registration, allows users to aggregate web content and organize it by theme
(for example, you can create a theme on film).â these boards contain
information which can take the form of videos, images, websites or text edited
by the service user (henceforth known as ânotesâ). [CLS] [SEP]

these boards are, by default, private, but itâs also possible to make them
public.â in theory, if you make your board public, other users have the
ability to view, comment on and like the notes they contain or to copy one or
more notes onto their own boards. [CLS] [SEP]

furthermore, whenever you carry out a search on our search engine, accessed
through the link [https://www.qwant.com](https://www.qwant.com/), you can
create notes by clicking on an icon located next to each referenced link. [CLS] [SEP] â at
this point, you can choose to insert your note onto an existing board, or to
create a new one. [CLS] [SEP]

an advanced search form for boards, which can be accessed by clicking
âsearch boardsâ will also be made available to you. [CLS] [SEP] this is a search
engine that catalogues all boards and notes made by users. [CLS] [SEP] in the boards
search form, youâre able to filter boards by category (ex.â sports, music,
film, etc.) as well as sort them according to number of followers, number of
notes, comments, or how often boards are updated. [CLS] [SEP]

### intellectual property

it is possible for you to publish content in the form of notes on your
boards.â we have no control over your notes. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that you possess
all rights related to your notes on the condition that the intellectual
property rights of authors and those with rights to the content youâre
publishing on your board are respected. [CLS] [SEP] you alone remain responsible for what
you publish. [CLS] [SEP]

you hereby grant us the permission of owning worldwide licensing and
reproduction rights over hosted content for the sole purposes of using,
promoting and improving the boards service. [CLS] [SEP]

### reporting content

for all information regarding reporting content, please refer to the
âreporting contentâ section of our [general terms of
service](https://about.qwant.com/fr/legal/cgu/qwant-search/). [CLS] [SEP]

### posting on boards

the content and information which you choose to aggregate and publish on your
boards (public and/or private) can include links to websites, images or videos
or can be related to personal notes. [CLS] [SEP]

you are free to choose the content you wish to aggregate on your boards,
subject to the following provisions:

you agree to not publish content:

  * that can constitute an apology for crimes against humanity or for war crimes;
  * that is liable to violate the respect and dignity of a human being, the safety of children and adolescents, particularly through the posting of messages that involve violence, pornography or paedophilia;
  * that is against public order or morale;
  * that is menacing, abusive, defamatory, hurtful in nature or constitutes harassment;
  * that can constitute an act of forgery, unfair trading or parasitism;
  * that provokes or causes the provocation of discrimination, hate or violence due to origin, gender, health, political or professional affiliation;
  * that violates oneâs private life;
  * that encourages the committing of crimes, offences or acts of terrorism;
  * that violates the right to confidentiality;
  * that provides a link to including, though not limited to, computer viruses or any other codes or programs known to disrupt, damage or limit the proper working of any sort of software, computer or telecommunications tool;
  * that enables, either directly or indirectly, third-party links to pirate software, software created for acts of piracy and for hacking into computer and telecommunication systems and, in general, all software tools or other tools allowing users to violate the rights of others and the safety of persons and property. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge that you alone are responsible for the contents and
consequences following their aggregation and their being shared on your
boards.â you agree to put the required permissions (rights, licenses, consent
and/or authorization) allowing you to share otherâs information.â on the
other hand, you are not allowed to publish content that includes elements you
are not legally authorized to possess. [CLS] [SEP]

we remind you that some content allowing you to directly or indirectly
identify people is subject to compliance with the [regulation (eu) 2016/679 of
the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such data](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a32016r0679). [CLS] [SEP]

you will be held responsible for all content that may infringe upon the rights
of others or applicable laws, including rules related to the right to oneâs
image and rights regarding intellectual property and shared content. [CLS] [SEP]

### personal data protection

our commitment to protecting your personal information is available
[here](https://about.qwant.com/legal/privacy/). [CLS] [SEP]

specifically regarding the boards service, regulations regarding data hosting
require us to uphold a retention obligation for the identification information
of content authors for the legal duration of one year. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, especially in the fight against terrorism and/or organised
crime, judiciary or administrative authorities can ask for the delivery of
this information. [CLS] [SEP] the data protection officer (dpo) is committed to attentive
examination and refusing any communication containing abusive information. [CLS] [SEP]

in its capacity as a private search engine, in no way do we endorse measures
adopted by governments, especially when they happen to be especially intrusive
with regards to an individualâs private life.â consequently, we do
everything we can to guarantee the protection of your personal information;
this remains and will remain our priority. [CLS] [SEP]

### cancelling, suspending and suppressing your boards account

for all information related to your qwant account, please consult the âqwant
accountâ section in our [general terms of
service](https://about.qwant.com/fr/legal/cgu/qwant-search/). [CLS] [SEP]

### account cancellation for scu violation

we reserve the right to temporarily or definitively refuse access to boards to
any user who does not respect the present scu or in case of proven or
suspected compromise of their account. [CLS] [SEP] the cancellation/suspension of an
account will be within the complete limits of the law, without prejudice to
damages or interests that qwant may solicit. [CLS] [SEP] we promise to inform the user in
advance by any means of communication and within a reasonable amount of time. [CLS] [SEP]
we reserve the right to keep any proof of the shortcomings by handing it over
to a third-party provider for the required amount of time until the dispute is
resolved. [CLS] [SEP]

### disrupting or suppressing boards services

in the event that we are forced to definitively disrupt providing boards
services, we will warn you in advance by any means of communication and within
a reasonable amount of time so you are able to transfer your information and
content to another provider. [CLS] [SEP]
