## f.lux privacy policy

### overview

when you visit the f.lux website or use our software, we work hard to protect
your privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

like most websites, our website uses cookies and google analytics, and we also
use forum software provided by third parties (nodebb). [CLS] [SEP]

our software uses online mapping services (including google maps) to find your
location, usually just once when you set things up. [CLS] [SEP] f.lux needs this
information to calculate the times of your sunrise and sunset. [CLS] [SEP] since operating
systems and hardware are changing quickly, f.lux also has an automatic update
feature that does daily checks and sends some information about your computer
configuration to us. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information about which versions and features
of the f.lux software are used. [CLS] [SEP] when you tell us to, we integrate with your
home lighting (and to make this work, sometimes we talk to web services owned
and operated by other companies). [CLS] [SEP] if we interact with you over social media,
we are not in control of what third-party companies do. [CLS] [SEP]

we intend that everything we do that could impact your privacy is visible to
you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, in the software, you can see a google map displayed in a
window, and updates to the software can be skipped. [CLS] [SEP]

you can read our full legal policy, below. [CLS] [SEP]

### f.lux privacy policy

we at f.lux software llc (âcompanyâ) know you care about the information
we may collect from you and that you may provide to us and how that
information is used and shared. [CLS] [SEP] please read the following to learn more about
our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this privacy policy, âsoftwareâ
means the f.lux software you are about to (or have already) downloaded and/or
installed, and âwebsiteâ refers to the
[justgetflux.com](https://justgetflux.com) website and related online services
operated by the company. [CLS] [SEP] by using the software in any manner, you acknowledge
that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy,
and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information
in the following ways. [CLS] [SEP]

remember that your use of companyâs software is at all times subject to the
[end user license agreement](../eula/), which incorporates this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP] any terms we use in this policy without defining them have the
definitions given to them in the [end user license agreement](../eula/). [CLS] [SEP]

### what does this privacy policy cover?

this privacy policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when
you are accessing or using our website and software, but not to the practices
of companies we donât own or control, or people that we donât manage. [CLS] [SEP] we
gather various types of information from our users, as explained in more
detail below, and we use this information in connection with our software,
including to personalize, provide, and improve our software and to analyze how
you use the software. [CLS] [SEP] in certain cases, we may also share some information
with third parties, but only as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 13, please do not attempt to download the
software and/or send or provide any personal information about yourself to us. [CLS] [SEP]
if we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age
13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe
that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please
contact us at [support@justgetflux.com](mailto:support@justgetflux.com). [CLS] [SEP]

### will company ever change this privacy policy?

weâre constantly trying to improve our software, so we may need to change
this privacy policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to
changes by placing a notice on [justgetflux.com](justgetflux.com), by sending
you a notification (as described in more detail below), and/or by some other
means. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if youâve opted not to receive legal notices from
us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the software, and you
are still responsible for reading and understanding them. [CLS] [SEP] if you use the
software after any changes to the privacy policy have been posted, that means
you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP] use of information we collect now is subject
to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is used. [CLS] [SEP]

### what information does company collect?

#### information you provide to us

we receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
if you use our software to search for your location, we may collect
geolocation data (including, without limitation, city names and specific
addresses you provide). [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect usage information such as your
software settings and preferences, and system information (including, without
limitation, make and model of your computer, driver versions, and connected
display types). [CLS] [SEP] certain information may be required to take advantage of some
of our features. [CLS] [SEP]

if you request support or ask a question about the software, we may
communicate with you if youâve provided us the means to do so (either
directly or through a third party service and/or an email provider). [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we may send you emails about your use of the software or responses to
comments or questions you may have. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information collected automatically

whenever you interact with our website or software using your browser or
device, we automatically receive and record information in our server logs,
which may include your ip address, device identification, âcookieâ
information, system and display information, and the type of browser and/or
device on which youâre using or accessing our website or software. [CLS] [SEP]

âcookiesâ are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow
us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when features in
our software are visited and by how many people. [CLS] [SEP] you may be able to change the
preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your deviceâs
acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some
of our features. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any
third parties, and we arenât responsible for their privacy policies and
practices. [CLS] [SEP] we may also automatically collect information such as geo-location
data based on the ip address of your device(s). [CLS] [SEP]

when we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data
in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, this aggregate data can tell us how many users speak a particular
language, or how many people use a particular feature of the software, and we
can use that knowledge to make the software useful to as many users as
possible. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information collected if you synchronize your settings

some versions of f.lux will allow you to synchronize settings with our
networked servers. [CLS] [SEP] this feature allows you to subscribe to networked lighting
schedules, to use the same schedule across your devices, and to control third-
party lighting products. [CLS] [SEP]

when you choose to use this synchronization feature, you agree that our
servers may transmit, record, and change your f.lux settings. [CLS] [SEP] you will have
the option to disconnect at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

### how will company use information that it collects?

#### notifications

from time to time, company may send notifications or messages (each, a
ânotificationâ) to you on the device(s) on which you are using the
software as part of our automatic updates. [CLS] [SEP] company may send you notifications
to highlight new features or tell you about changes to the software. [CLS] [SEP]
notifications will display using a system notifier, or your default web
browser (because this is the most secure way for company to communicate these
messages to you). [CLS] [SEP] you may opt out of receiving notifications by disabling
software updates. [CLS] [SEP]

### will company share any of the information it receives?

we neither rent nor sell your information in personally identifiable form to
anyone. [CLS] [SEP] however, we may share your information with third parties as described
in this section:

**third parties:** on our website or in the software, we may utilize services
available to us (such as google maps, philips hue, and email providers), and
we may partner or work with third party services (such as lighting controls,
fitness, geolocation providers, or home automation companies) to offer you
certain features in connection with the software, and such third party
services may collect information from our users. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, we may offer
support services via social networks like facebook and twitter. [CLS] [SEP] we have no
control over the policies and practices of third party services as to privacy
or anything else, so please familiarize yourself with their policies. [CLS] [SEP]

**agents:** we may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our
behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or
software to you. [CLS] [SEP] unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any
right to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
assist us. [CLS] [SEP]

**business transfers:** we may choose to buy or sell assets. [CLS] [SEP] in these types of
transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets
that would be transferred. [CLS] [SEP] also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we
go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of
control, information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by
a third party. [CLS] [SEP]

**partners:** we may work with select partners to distribute the software (for
example, to install f.lux with a new pc). [CLS] [SEP] in these cases, we may share
aggregate traffic data (number of installs, number of active users) with these
third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

**protection of company and others:** we reserve the right to access, read,
preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply
with law or court order; enforce or apply our [end user license
agreement](../eula/) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
safety of company, our employees, our users, or others. [CLS] [SEP]
