## your california privacy rights





by availing yourself of the rights afforded in this section of our privacy
policy, you are declaring that you are a california resident:

other residents: you may make a verified request to indeed regarding your
personal data. [CLS] [SEP] while indeed does not sell your personal data, you can
nonetheless make a formal request to delete your personal data held by indeed. [CLS] [SEP]
this process is detailed in section 10 of our privacy policy, which also
describes the designated address information for making requests to indeed
regarding your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

**the right to know your personal data**

you have the right to request that we disclose the personal data we collect,
use, disclose and ‚Äúsell‚Äù ( _we explain this term further in section 13.2,
below_ ) about you. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on how to exercise this right, please
see section 10 of our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

the following sections of our [summary of indeed‚Äôs privacy
policy](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#privacysummary) explain the
categories of personal data we collected over the past twelve (12) months
(section 3), why we collected this information (section 4), and the third
parties with which we shared it (section 5). [CLS] [SEP]

we also cover these topics more expansively in our [full privacy
policy](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#privacypolicy): sections
[2.1-2.3](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#s2) explain the categories
of personal data we collect; sections

[https://www.indeed.com/legal/ccpa-dns](https://www.indeed.com/legal/ccpa-

found in our privacy center at <https://hrtechprivacy.com/>. [CLS] [SEP]

california‚Äôs ‚Äú _shine the light_ ‚Äù law (civil code section 1798.83) also
permits california residents once per calendar year to request and receive
information about a business‚Äô disclosure of certain categories of personal
data to other companies for direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california
resident and a user of our site, you can request a copy of this information
from indeed by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces). [CLS] [SEP]

## indeed general terms of service

**last updated: ****march 5, 2021**







### a. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service for job seekers





#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] job ads or job listings

indeed, which is free to those individuals searching for employment openings
(‚Äújob seekers‚Äù), may make available job ads advertising employment
opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party
websites (‚Äújob listings‚Äù or ‚Äújob ads‚Äù), through indeed‚Äôs search results or
otherwise through the site. [CLS] [SEP] searching for job ads on indeed is free for job
seekers. [CLS] [SEP] job ads are created and provided by third parties over whom indeed
exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that indeed has no
control over the content of job ads, links to or from job ads, or any
conditions third parties might impose once a job seeker has submitted an
application or left the site. [CLS] [SEP] for example, some of these third parties may
attempt to charge job seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although
indeed endeavors not to make such job ads available on the site. [CLS] [SEP] if you leave
the indeed site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any
terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. [CLS] [SEP] employer websites may have
conversion trackers or other functionality provided by indeed, which informs
us that an application has been completed on an employer site. [CLS] [SEP] an employer who
installs such functionality is required under this agreement to provide any
notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
however, you acknowledge and agree that indeed has no control over such an
employer or its website. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to indeed‚Äôs use of, and receipt of
information from, any such conversion tracker functionality. [CLS] [SEP] except for
sponsored, featured or paid placements, the job ads contained on, or linked
from, the site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. [CLS] [SEP] indeed has no
obligation to screen any job ads, or to include any job ads, in its search
results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any job ads from the site
or your search result for any or no reason. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that
indeed has no obligation to present you with any or all job ads. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot
confirm the accuracy or completeness of any job ad or other information
submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such
employer or other user. [CLS] [SEP] indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all
liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or
availability of any job ads, company pages, screener questions and responses,
and assessments. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, indeed may provide search options to narrow
down job ads search results by job type categories (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] full-time, part-time,
etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by indeed,
and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the job ads. [CLS] [SEP] indeed
may reformat job listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile
phone. [CLS] [SEP] placement of a job ad on a certain page (for example, on indeed gigs)
is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
while indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post
job ads, helping keep indeed job search free for job seekers, all job ads are
considered advertising. [CLS] [SEP] indeed displays job ads based on a combination of
employer bids and relevance, such as search terms, and other information
provided and activities conducted on indeed. [CLS] [SEP] you are not permitted to use
indeed‚Äôs site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for
purposes of this section a of the indeed general terms of service, all
references to ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù shall mean you, the individual or organization
accessing this site in your capacity as a job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may provide
functionality to call a telephone number contained in a job ad using the phone
app on a mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone
number is the correct phone number for the employer or for the job ad you are
viewing. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] resumes and recommended jobs

by creating a public resume through the site, you are requesting and
authorizing indeed to make available your resume to third parties, such as
employers, that indeed believes may have an interest in your resume. [CLS] [SEP] by
creating or uploading a resume on indeed (an ‚Äúindeed resume‚Äù), indeed may
share with you job ads that match the contents of your indeed resume. [CLS] [SEP] indeed
may also highlight to you items in your resume that may match qualifications
from the job ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the job ad and may
be missing from your resume. [CLS] [SEP] these highlights do not mean you are or are not
qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. [CLS] [SEP] applying
for such job ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. [CLS] [SEP] even where
indeed highlights items or a job ad is shared with you, indeed assumes no
responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy,
completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of job ads or highlights. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or
application information you post, send or receive through the site. [CLS] [SEP] it is your
responsibility to review your resume to ensure it contains the right
information or any information you intend to include or update. [CLS] [SEP] if you see any
inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such
information or to contact indeed to do so. [CLS] [SEP] to protect your privacy, indeed may
mask or hide your contact information, such as your email address, from your
resume or application, for example, and may substitute it with an alias. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set your resume to public,
and may toggle a public resume to private, at any time, to prevent illegal
conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in indeed‚Äôs discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or
application information you post, send or receive through the site. [CLS] [SEP] it is your
responsibility to review your resume to ensure it contains the right
information or any information you intend to include or update. [CLS] [SEP] if you see any
inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such
information or to contact indeed to do so. [CLS] [SEP] to protect your privacy, indeed may
mask or hide your contact information, such as your email address, from your
resume or application, for example, and may substitute it with an alias. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set your resume to public,
and may toggle a public resume to private, at any time, to prevent illegal
conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in indeed‚Äôs discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address
you use to create an indeed account or apply to a job. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may determine
what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors,
including but not limited to, any information you input on the site about
yourself (including in your indeed resume), searches you run on the site, jobs
you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job
application to an employer through indeed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] applying to jobs through indeed

any resume or application information that you submit through the site,
including personal data included in a resume, application or responses to
screener questions and assessments (‚Äúindeed apply‚Äù), is subject to this
agreement (including section d.3.) and to indeed‚Äôs privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] once you
provide information to an employer (whether in the form of a job application,
resume, email, or otherwise), indeed does not have control over the employer‚Äôs
use or disclosure of that information. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to request the employer
delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must
make such a request directly to the employer. [CLS] [SEP] (all references on the site to
‚Äúapply now‚Äù, ‚Äúeasily apply‚Äù, ‚Äúsimple apply‚Äù, ‚Äúapply from your phone‚Äù, ‚Äúapply
with indeed‚Äù, ‚Äúrsvp to hiring event‚Äù or any similar references mean ‚Äúindeed
apply.‚Äù) indeed may use your application materials to determine whether you
may be interested in a job listing, and indeed may reach out to you about such
job listing. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may store such information regardless of whether a job
listing has been closed or is no longer available on the site. [CLS] [SEP] to maintain the
quality of the site and services, indeed in its sole discretion may impose
limits on your ability to apply to job listings or to other indeed services. [CLS] [SEP]
in addition, when you indicate your interest in a job listing through indeed
apply or by rsvping to a hiring event you are sending your resume and
application information to indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing
indeed to make available such application information to the applicable
employer(s) for such job listing(s). [CLS] [SEP] when you ask indeed to transmit an
application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer
letter, to an employer via indeed apply or indeed‚Äôs relay system, or store
such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that
indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that employers may request that indeed assemble your
application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment
responses and other information you provide to indeed into one document, and
you agree that in doing so, indeed assembles these application materials on
your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] when you apply for a job on indeed you agree to indeed‚Äôs
performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such
processing is an essential part of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, you consent
to your application and any responses sent to you by the employer (including
offer letters) through indeed being processed and analyzed by indeed according
to this agreement and indeed‚Äôs privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

when you apply to a job using indeed apply, indeed will attempt to send your
application to the contact information provided to us by an employer or their
agent. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be
delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. [CLS] [SEP] indeed also does not
guarantee that any employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or
respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will
be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. [CLS] [SEP] however, indeed may
alert you when any of the above events occur. [CLS] [SEP] please note that job ads may
expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is
received. [CLS] [SEP] indeed has no responsibility for expired job ads or for delivering
applications prior to a job ad‚Äôs expiration. [CLS] [SEP] in addition we cannot vouch for
the validity of the contact information provided to us by employers. [CLS] [SEP] we also
cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites,
including but not limited to applicant tracking systems (atss). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having
your application or messages stored on indeed, do not use the indeed apply or
indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly
to the employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public
mail system. [CLS] [SEP] you may contact the employer directly to find alternative methods
of application if you do not wish to apply through indeed. [CLS] [SEP] by using the indeed
apply system, you fully consent to the above. [CLS] [SEP]

if you require alternative methods of screening or application you must
approach the employer directly to request such as indeed is not responsible
for the employer application process. [CLS] [SEP]

by using indeed, you agree that indeed is not responsible for the content of
the employer‚Äôs job application, messages, screener questions, skills
assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that indeed does not
guarantee receipt of your application by the employer, or your receipt of
messages from the employer. [CLS] [SEP] please note that indeed does not choose the
questions asked by employers or decide the job qualification criteria of
employers. [CLS] [SEP] some questions may be labeled as optional, indicating only that the
application may be submitted to the employer without providing an answer. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed cannot guarantee that the employer will consider such an application or
make a particular determination with regard to such an application. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may
inform job seekers that an employer‚Äôs requirement from a job description does
not appear to be present on a resume or application; this information is
presented without warranty and indeed does not guarantee that updating a
resume or application will result in any job offer. [CLS] [SEP] indeed does not guarantee
the identity of an employer or any individuals working for any employers, and
cautions job seekers when applying to jobs. [CLS] [SEP] indeed cannot make any guarantee
regarding health and safety measures in an employer‚Äôs hiring or interviewing
process. [CLS] [SEP] indeed recommends job seekers follow personal health and safety best
practices as recommended by the world health organization or similar
institution. [CLS] [SEP]  **indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and
cautions job seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an
adverse action regarding their current employment situations. [CLS] [SEP] job seekers are
solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any employer or job offer.**

indeed may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to
screener questions) and the recency of your activity on indeed to determine
whether the words of any job seeker‚Äôs resume and answers to screener questions
match the words of a job listing or resume query, and vice-versa. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
and consent that indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener
questions from those that do not match, and present them to employers as
matches or not matches. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may also use such information in order to
improve the site or any other indeed product or service (including by
displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job listings and
resumes to job seekers and employers). [CLS] [SEP] by using indeed apply and answering
screener questions, you acknowledge that employers may have instructed indeed
to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought
by the employer, and you acknowledge that indeed has no discretion in the
transmission of these rejections. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may offer employers the ability to
activate a feature on their account called employer assist. [CLS] [SEP] activating
employer assist means the employer is instructing indeed to send a message on
the employer‚Äôs behalf to the job seeker informing them that the employer has
determined not to move forward with their application. [CLS] [SEP] these notices are
automatically sent after a period of time selected by the employer, unless the
employer indicates to indeed their interest in your application. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge and agree that indeed has no discretion in the sending of these
messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the employer‚Äôs
decision to activate employer assist and to not take an action on your
application on indeed within the time period selected by the employer. [CLS] [SEP] any
interactions the employer has directly with you and not through a tool
provided by indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of
through an indeed relay service) are not visible to indeed, and would not by
themselves prevent an employer assist rejection notice from being sent. [CLS] [SEP]

when you search for jobs on the indeed job search app and proceed to apply for
a job, including jobs on third party sites, indeed may suggest information
from your indeed profile to include in your application. [CLS] [SEP] it is your
responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them

only send you job listings that indeed hire determines may be of interest to
you. [CLS] [SEP] you further acknowledge that indeed hire is not authorised to receive any
money on your behalf and/or to enter into any contracts on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] you
may also end your relationship with indeed hire at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the site or
any other indeed product or service (including to provide better search
results and other listings for job seekers and employers), whether via
automated means or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] when an employer views, sends, stores or
receives materials through or using the site, indeed may inform you about such

chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or
through the site. [CLS] [SEP] in all cases, such messages or notifications are provided

employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on
notifications through indeed. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may use your email address to create an
alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual
email address to the employer. [CLS] [SEP] should you choose to send an email from a third
party email client, the person with whom you‚Äôre communicating may be able to
see your email address, rather than the alias. [CLS] [SEP] indeed disclaims all warranties
with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not
guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time
at which they may be sent. [CLS] [SEP] in the event a message being sent is intended for a

site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact
with the site, employers, or job listings on our site (‚Äúchatbot‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] you

human interaction. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and
completeness of information submitted through the chatbot. [CLS] [SEP] indeed is not
responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of

employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual and remote
communications using indeed products, including but not limited to, indeed

telecommunications service provider and that indeed is only providing the
option for you to communicate with employers via services that may be offered
by third-party providers. [CLS] [SEP] please note that since these telecommunication
services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may
be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot

#### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] indeed assessments

indeed assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills
assessments selected by employers (‚Äúassessments‚Äù) and responses from job
seekers (‚Äúresponses‚Äù) through the site. [CLS] [SEP] employers may use the indeed
assessments tool to send you assessments, to which you may provide responses. [CLS] [SEP]
after you provide a response, the employer will be able to use the indeed
assessments platform to review the response. [CLS] [SEP] if there are multiple versions of
the same assessment, the response percentile for any job seeker will be
determined only in relation to other responses to the same version of that
assessment. [CLS] [SEP]

an assessment only evaluates a particular skill. [CLS] [SEP] it does not evaluate a job
seeker‚Äôs qualification for any job. [CLS] [SEP] whether a particular skill is relevant to
a job, or whether a job seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is
decided solely by the employer sending the assessment and reviewing your
response. [CLS] [SEP] receiving or responding to an assessment does not guarantee a job or
job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further
communication or action by any employer. [CLS] [SEP] an employer is the sole party to
determine whether a response indicates a qualified job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] employers may
have instructed indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not responded
to assessments in a manner acceptable to the employer, and you acknowledge
that indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. [CLS] [SEP] the
employer is the sole party to determine whether to consider any retaken
assessments as part of their hiring process. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and understand that employers select which assessments to
associate with their job openings, and that indeed does not choose the
assessments sent by employers and has no control over employers‚Äô selection or
use of assessments. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the questions in any assessment are solely
being asked by the employer sending the assessment and are not being asked by

alternative methods of screening, if so required by the americans with
disabilities act or any other equivalent or similar law, and that the
responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with
employers**. [CLS] [SEP] if you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of
assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the employer. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed may provide a means by which you may request such an alternative method
or other accommodation from the employer; indeed does not guarantee the
employer‚Äôs receipt of, or response to, any such request. [CLS] [SEP] while indeed is
guided by wcag 2.1, level aa in our efforts to design and develop accessible
offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, indeed does not warrant
that the method of delivery of any assessment question is compliant with the
americans with disabilities act or any equivalent or similar law. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree and acknowledge that the usefulness and value of assessments and
responses depend on their contents being kept confidential. [CLS] [SEP] you therefore
agree to keep the content of assessments and responses confidential and to not
reproduce or discuss them with anyone, except that you may communicate with an
employer about an assessment they have sent to you and your response. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed does not have any obligation to screen any assessment or response, or
to include any assessment or response in the site, and may exclude or remove
any assessment or response from the site for any or no reason without
liability or notice. [CLS] [SEP] assessment links sent to you may continue to be active
after an employer has paused or closed their job campaign on indeed. [CLS] [SEP] once an
employer pauses or closes their job ad (for example, after the employer has
made a hire), indeed cannot guarantee that the employer will view any related
notices or updates, including assessments, responses, and accommodation
requests. [CLS] [SEP] you may still choose to take the assessment for the purpose of
adding its results to your indeed profile or for another job application. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed may also offer you the option to select an assessment to complete
independent of a particular job, and your response will be associated with
your indeed profile. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose whether the response is available to
employers viewing your indeed profile, though indeed will count the response
for purposes of generating aggregate response statistics even if your response
is hidden. [CLS] [SEP]

as a job seeker, you consent to your responses, applications, and any other
communications sent through indeed assessments being processed and analyzed by
indeed according to this agreement and indeed‚Äôs [privacy
policy](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#privacypolicy). [CLS] [SEP] you are
requesting and authorizing indeed to make your response available to the
employer providing the assessment, or (in the case of assessments selected by
you) to any employer viewing your indeed profile. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that this is
without warranty, and that indeed reserves the right to display or reformat
responses in a manner to permit employers to review your response together
with responses from other job seekers. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may aggregate the results of all
job seeker-selected assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile
for your response. [CLS] [SEP] you also acknowledge that once you have requested that

respond to any response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission
of the data. [CLS] [SEP] however, indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur. [CLS] [SEP]

notification requirements in any country; (ii) contains proprietary
information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements,

other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly
permitted by us in writing); or (iii) directly or indirectly violates the site

tool. [CLS] [SEP] by using indeed assessments, you acknowledge and agree that indeed is
not procuring employees for employers or procuring opportunities to work for
job seekers. [CLS] [SEP] indeed merely provides a tool enabling employers and job seekers
to exchange assessments and responses as they determine. [CLS] [SEP] the sole
responsibility for the content of any assessment or response, any requests for
interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of
employment, and any other issues arising from the use of indeed assessments,
is solely with employers or job seekers as applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

as a job seeker, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable
employment, equality or discrimination laws, the us fair credit reporting act,
any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or
credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the

between an employer and job seeker, regardless of whether or not indeed
receives a fee from the employer in connection with the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] indeed
will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such
transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or
availability of the site, the indeed assessments tool, and any assessment or
response. [CLS] [SEP]

offer letter, to a job seeker through indeed‚Äôs relay functions, do not use the
indeed relay functions and please contact the job seeker via the personal

seeker‚Äôs motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no
guarantee as to the job seeker‚Äôs qualifications or interest in your job

indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to employer names or

indeed‚Äù. [CLS] [SEP] employers may also request that indeed add such labels. [CLS] [SEP] indeed shall
determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which
employers qualify. [CLS] [SEP] the lack of a label or badge may indicate that indeed does
not have sufficient data to determine if an employer qualifies. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **3\. [CLS] [SEP] job match**

indeed may use job seekers‚Äô application materials (including resumes and
responses to screener questions) and the recency of their activity on indeed
to determine whether the words of their resume and answers to screener
questions match the words of your job listing or resume query, and vice-versa. [CLS] [SEP]
you further agree and consent that indeed may differentiate those matching
resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them
to you as matches or not matches. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may also use such information in
order to improve the site or any other indeed product or service (including by
displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job listings and
resumes to job seekers and employers). [CLS] [SEP]

#### **4\. [CLS] [SEP] salary, applies or other information provided by indeed**

given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or
varying levels of accuracy. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to information regarding estimated

this is not the information you are purchasing from indeed and you are not
charged per apply. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other
than job listings on the site. [CLS] [SEP] please note that all salary figures are
approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to indeed,
including from indeed affiliates. [CLS] [SEP] these figures are given to indeed users for
the purpose of generalized comparison only. [CLS] [SEP] minimum wage may differ by

does not comply with the americans with disabilities act or similar or
equivalent law, or that such screening tool results in a ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed may offer employers the ability to activate a feature on their account
called employer assist. [CLS] [SEP] activating employer assist means the employer is
instructing indeed to send a message on the employer‚Äôs behalf to the job
seeker informing them that the employer has determined not to move forward
with their application. [CLS] [SEP] to prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you
must indicate your interest in the application on indeed. [CLS] [SEP] any interactions you
have directly with a job seeker and not through a tool provided by indeed (for
example, calling or emailing a job seeker directly instead of through an
indeed relay service) are not visible to indeed, and will not prevent an
employer assist rejection notice from being sent. [CLS] [SEP] if you activate employer
assist then you must interact with a job seeker through a tool provided by
indeed to prevent an employer assist rejection notice from being sent. [CLS] [SEP] if you
activate employer assist you agree that you are instructing indeed to send

hyperlinked to [http://www.indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com?hl=en&co=us) or
other indeed website as agreed with indeed and the word ‚Äúindeed‚Äù shall be the
indeed logo image and shall also be hyperlinked to[
http://www.indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com?hl=en&co=us) or other indeed
website as agreed by indeed. [CLS] [SEP] we provide the [indeed logo
image](http://www.indeed.com/p/jobsearch.gif?hl=en&co=us) online for your
convenience. [CLS] [SEP]  

publisher agrees to abide by all terms of the aaup. [CLS] [SEP] publisher is not permitted
to use indeed‚Äôs site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
publisher agrees not to access (or attempt to access) the site by any means
other than through the interface that is provided by indeed, unless it has
been specifically allowed to do so in a separate, written agreement with
indeed. [CLS] [SEP] use of any automated system or software, whether operated by a third
party or otherwise, to extract data from the site (such as screen scraping,
crawling, reproducing, duplicating, copying, selling, trading or reselling) is
prohibited. [CLS] [SEP] publisher agrees that it is solely responsible for (and that
indeed has no responsibility or liability to it or to any third party for) any
breach of publisher‚Äôs obligations under these ipp terms and for any
consequences (including any loss or damage which indeed may suffer) of any
such breach. [CLS] [SEP]

publisher agrees that it shall not transmit to indeed or upload to or through
the site (whether as user content or otherwise) any harmful code, or use or
misappropriate the site for its own commercial gain. [CLS] [SEP] ‚Äúharmful code‚Äù shall mean
any software (sometimes referred to as ‚Äúviruses,‚Äù ‚Äúworms,‚Äù ‚Äútrojan horses,‚Äù
‚Äútime bombs,‚Äù ‚Äútime locks,‚Äù ‚Äúdrop dead devices,‚Äù ‚Äútraps,‚Äù ‚Äúaccess codes,‚Äù
‚Äúcancelbots‚Äù or ‚Äútrap door devices‚Äù) that: (a) is designed to damage, disrupt,
disable, harm, impair, interfere with, intercept, expropriate or otherwise
impede in any manner, any data, storage media, program, system, equipment or
communication, based on any event, including for example but not limited to
(i) exceeding a number of copies, (ii) exceeding a number of users, (iii)
passage of a period of time, (iv) advancement to a particular date or other
numeral, or (v) use of a feature; or (b) would enable an unauthorized person
to cause such result; or (c) would enable an unauthorized person to access
another person‚Äôs information without such other person‚Äôs knowledge and
permission. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right to use a variety of methods to detect
and block the above anomalous activity and to screen user content to prevent
abuse such as spam or fraud. [CLS] [SEP] however, such detection methods are not perfect
and false positives may occur. [CLS] [SEP] if publisher uses the site, publisher agrees to
indeed enforcing the above rules or attempting to prevent spam, fraud, or
other anomalous activity. [CLS] [SEP] such measures may result in a temporary or permanent
suspension or termination of publisher‚Äôs account, of its access to indeed‚Äôs
message relay, or of its use of any other functions of the site, with or
without notice. [CLS] [SEP] indeed shall not be responsible or liable for any such
suspension or termination, including any consequences thereof. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the
right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message
with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp,
.jar, .jse, .lib, .so, .dll, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct,
.shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment or any
other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other messages
that indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason. [CLS] [SEP] indeed
further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether
publisher is perpetrating a scam, spamming indeed or its users, or otherwise
conducting fraudulent activity on indeed by various means, including but not
limited to investigating publisher‚Äôs functionality by setting up profiles and
names that belong to indeed. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right to turn over any
information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third
party if indeed has a good faith belief that publisher is using the site in
violation of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] as indeed wishes to prohibit automated entities from
following any individual links posted by publisher, all hyperlinks to indeed‚Äôs
site should include the use of rel=‚Äùnofollow‚Äù. [CLS] [SEP] this applies to editorially
placed links, links generated by indeed‚Äôs api, or other link mechanisms. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed reserves the right to take such action as it considers necessary,
including issuing legal proceedings without further notice, in relation to any
unauthorized use of the site. [CLS] [SEP] if publisher wishes to make commercial use of
the site, if publisher wishes to make use of the site in any capacity other
than that of a jobseeker or employer, or if publishes wishes to purchase
indeed services that utilize the site, publisher must have a prior written
agreement with indeed to do so, or have accepted indeed‚Äôs online terms of
service. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed reserves the right at all times (but will not have any obligation) to
terminate users, and reclaim usernames or urls, for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] indeed also
reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend publisher‚Äôs participation
in the program if it suspects any violations of the aaup. [CLS] [SEP] publisher hereby
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold indeed harmless from and against any
claims, demands, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and attorney fees
arising from or relating to a violation or purported violation by publisher of
the aaup. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies that indeed may have as a result of a violation of the aaup by
publisher. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, under no circumstances may publisher impersonate or
act as indeed on any site (which shall include bidding on indeed‚Äôs names or
trademarks in any search engine marketing advertising platform), including,
but not limited to, on third party sites. [CLS] [SEP] any marketing performed by publisher
must comply with all laws of the jurisdiction in which the marketing is
conducted, including but not limited to email, text messaging and general
advertising laws, and publisher agrees to defend and indemnify indeed from any
third party action, claim, or demand against indeed arising from any violation
of those laws. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed will not be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information
provided by publisher or by another information content provider. [CLS] [SEP] indeed will
also not be held liable on account of any action taken in good faith to
restrict access or availability of material that it or its users considered to
be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or
otherwise objection, whether or not such material is constitutionally
protected or on account of any action taken to enable or make available to
information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access
to any such material described above. [CLS] [SEP]

some areas of the site, including areas that may permit publisher to set up an
indeed account, requires publisher to register or provide an email address. [CLS] [SEP] if
publisher so registers, it agrees to (a) provide true, accurate, current and
complete information about publisher as prompted by indeed‚Äôs registration form
(including publisher‚Äôs email address) and (b) be responsible for the
confidentiality and use of publisher‚Äôs username and password, and not transfer
or resell its use of or access to the site to any third party. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that any individuals with whom publisher has shared its username and password
and who are able to answer verification questions about its indeed account may
receive access to information regarding publisher‚Äôs indeed account. [CLS] [SEP]

publisher hereby grants indeed permission to refer to publisher and its
websites in indeed‚Äôs marketing materials, wherever such marketing materials
shall appear. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **3\. [CLS] [SEP] payments to publisher**

publisher shall receive a commission payment with respect to valid clicks
received (as determined solely by indeed and subject to any cap amounts
determined solely by indeed) in relation to program elements displayed on
accepted urls. [CLS] [SEP] publisher acknowledges and agrees that, in each case, the
amount of such commission payment will be determined solely by indeed, in its
sole discretion, and that such commission amount may be subject to a cap, also
to be determined by indeed in its sole discretion and subject to change at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] publisher also acknowledges and agrees that any billing and payment
information that publisher provides to indeed may be shared by indeed with
companies who work on indeed‚Äôs behalf, such as payment processors, solely for
the purposes of effecting payment to publisher and servicing its account. [CLS] [SEP]
publisher shall not be compensated for any transactions generated by publisher
or any party acting on publisher‚Äôs behalf. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, indeed shall not be
obligated to pay for any artificial and/or fraudulent impressions or clicks as
determined by indeed or if publisher is in breach of these ipp terms. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition and not in limitation to the above, publisher shall refund the share
of that revenue paid to publisher, if caused by artificial or fraudulent
impressions. [CLS] [SEP] no dashboard or any other view of any click count shall be
considered as contractually binding on indeed. [CLS] [SEP] all commission amounts may be
subject to an overall commission cap, in indeed‚Äôs sole discretion, and subject
to change at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **4\. [CLS] [SEP] qualifying links**

as of march 3, 2017, the below portion of the ipp will no longer be available
to any new publisher. [CLS] [SEP] as of march 31, 2017, the below portion of the ipp will
no longer be available to any publisher, including existing publishers who are
part of the ipp. [CLS] [SEP]

[publisher may earn a commission, as determined by indeed in its sole
discretion, if publisher refers a qualified user (as defined below) to the
indeed website via a qualifying link (as defined below) and if such qualified
user has accessed the indeed website and purchased a qualifying service
(‚Äúqualifying purchase‚Äù) during a session (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP] not all services
will be eligible as a qualifying purchase under the program, and qualifying
purchases are determined in indeed‚Äôs sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] indeed is under no
obligation to pay any particular amount for any referral and it is in indeed‚Äôs
absolute discretion to determine for how long a period of time it shall pay
this commission after the date the qualified user initially arrives at indeed
via a qualifying link from the publisher‚Äôs publisher property (‚Äúinitial
contact‚Äô). [CLS] [SEP] no payments under this program shall be any indication of future
payments under this program. [CLS] [SEP]

a ‚Äúqualifying link‚Äù is a link directing a qualified user from publisher‚Äôs
website or online property (‚Äúpublisher property‚Äù) to indeed using a program
element provided by indeed for use with the program. [CLS] [SEP] a ‚Äúsession‚Äù is the period
of time beginning when a qualified user initially arrives at indeed via a
qualifying link from the publisher‚Äôs publisher property (‚Äúinitial contact‚Äù),
and ending at indeed‚Äôs absolute discretion. [CLS] [SEP] for avoidance of doubt, publisher
acknowledges that a session will not commence unless cookies are enabled on
the customer‚Äôs device or computer in a manner that enables indeed to fully
attribute actions of qualified user to publisher‚Äôs qualifying link. [CLS] [SEP] a
‚Äúqualified user‚Äù is a user who has not previously registered with indeed, has
not been previously ‚Äúcookied‚Äù by indeed and has not previously visited the
indeed site, all as determined by indeed in its sole and absolute discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

the parties acknowledge and agree that indeed shall have the sole right and
responsibility for processing all orders made by qualified users. [CLS] [SEP] publisher
acknowledges that all agreements relating to sales to qualified users shall be
between indeed and the qualified user.]

as of march 31, 2017, the following will be the only available method for
participation in the ipp:

[publisher may earn a commission, as determined by indeed in its sole
discretion, if a user clicks on a qualifying link. [CLS] [SEP] a ‚Äúqualifying link‚Äù is a
link directing a user from the publisher‚Äôs website or online property
(‚Äúpublisher property‚Äù) to a job using a program element provided by indeed for
use with the program, such as pay-per-click advertising, jobroll‚Ñ¢, or job
search results.]

publisher shall not be entitled to commissions and shall reverse any
commissions already paid if publisher is in breach of these ipp terms or has
engaged in any fraudulent activity, including, but not limited to, cookie
stuffing, cloaking, or forcing pop-ups. [CLS] [SEP] the determination as to whether a sale
is made via a qualifying link, and whether a commission is payable, will be
made by indeed in its sole and absolute discretion and is final and binding on
publisher. [CLS] [SEP] prices for the qualifying purchases will be set solely by indeed in
its sole and absolute discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **5\. [CLS] [SEP] terms of payment**

indeed shall pay publisher within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar
quarter; provided the amount owing to publisher is at least one hundred us
dollars ($100). [CLS] [SEP] if the amount owing to publisher is less than $100, the
balance will carry over to subsequent calendar quarters until such time that
the quarter-end balance is at least one hundred us dollars ($100). [CLS] [SEP] publisher
is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and
payment information associated with publisher account. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may withhold any
and all payment if publisher is in breach of these ipp terms and indeed shall
have no further liability to publisher. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **6\. [CLS] [SEP] termination**

either party may terminate these ipp terms and participation in the program at
any time by sending a notice by email to support-at-indeed dot com or other
email address specified by indeed in the case of indeed, and to the email
address specified in publisher‚Äôs profile in the program in the case of
publisher. [CLS] [SEP]

upon termination of a publisher from the program, for any reason and by either
party, publisher shall immediately remove all insertion codes and other
program elements from all pages of its websites. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **7\. [CLS] [SEP] confidentiality**

publisher shall not disclose indeed confidential information without indeed‚Äôs
prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] ‚Äúindeed confidential information‚Äù includes without
limitation: (a) all indeed software, technology, programming, specifications,
materials, guidelines and documentation relating to the program; (b) click-
through rates or other performance statistics relating to the program provided
to publisher by indeed; and (c) any other information designated in writing by
indeed as ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or an equivalent designation. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **8\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification**

publisher shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless indeed, its agents,
affiliates, licensors, and partners from any third party claim or liability
(including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of
publisher‚Äôs program use, publisher property, site or publisher services, or
breach of these ipp terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **9\. [CLS] [SEP] governing law and dispute resolution**

these ipp terms and any dispute arising out of or in connection with these ipp
terms or related in any way to the site (‚Äúdispute‚Äù) will be governed as to all
matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and
performance of these ipp terms, by and under the laws of the state of texas,
united states of america, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles
thereof. [CLS] [SEP] any and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to
such dispute shall be filed only in the federal or state courts located in
travis county, texas, u.s.a. [CLS] [SEP] each of the parties hereby consent to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in
travis county, texas, u.s.a. [CLS] [SEP]

you also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action
or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the site or
these terms of service, if you are located in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **10\. [CLS] [SEP] class action waiver**

by using the site and in return for the services offered by indeed, publisher
acknowledges that indeed can only offer publisher these services under the
terms and conditions as presented herein. [CLS] [SEP] as partial consideration for
publisher‚Äôs use of the site and these services, publisher agrees not to sue
indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member,
or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit
against indeed regarding publisher‚Äôs use of the site. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, as a
publisher, the use of the site is at no charge and publisher acknowledges that
part of the price it is paying to use this site is its acceptance of these
terms of service including this class action waiver. [CLS] [SEP] if publisher does not
agree to any part of these terms, publisher should not continue use of the
site. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this paragraph, however, limits publisher‚Äôs rights to bring a
lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject
to the jurisdiction requirements found in section 9 above. [CLS] [SEP]



### d. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service for all users





the following terms and conditions apply to all job seekers, employers,
publishers and other users who access or use the site, or otherwise indicate
their acceptance to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of this section d of the
indeed general terms of service, all references to ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù shall mean
you, the individual or organization accessing this site in any capacity. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **1\. [CLS] [SEP] accessing external sites**

the site contains links to other sites on the internet which are owned and/or
operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the ‚Äúexternal
sites‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that indeed is not responsible or liable for any such
third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or
through any external sites. [CLS] [SEP] you should contact the site administrator or
webmaster for the applicable external site if you have any concerns regarding
such links or the materials located on an external site. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, indeed may provide you with links to third party sites that offer
you services for your use or benefit. [CLS] [SEP] we may stop offering any such third
party sites or services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] **if you choose to use such third party
sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at
your own risk.** when entering into an agreement with such parties, you are
giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are
determined by their privacy policies and terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] **we are not
responsible for any content or services provided by these third parties, and
disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such
third parties.** **we are additionally not responsible for any payment that
may be asked of you by such third party. [CLS] [SEP] you will be notified on the site that
these are third party sites and services, and not indeed.**

for example, indeed may provide you with access to a link on indeed to
background check services offered and performed by a third party (each a
‚Äúthird-party background check service‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] this service may be offered in the
form of permitting a jobseeker to request their own background check or
permitting an employer to request a background check of a jobseeker. [CLS] [SEP] if you
choose to use this link and these services, you are contracting directly with
the third-party background check service, and indeed is not a party to this
contract. [CLS] [SEP] please note (and you acknowledge) that indeed cannot and does not
assemble, access, view, analyze, manipulate, alter, evaluate or store the
background check reports provided by any third-party background check service
to you or to any other indeed user. [CLS] [SEP] indeed operates solely as a technical
conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a third-party
background check service to you. [CLS] [SEP] further, you agree to fully indemnify and
defend indeed for any claims arising out of your use of a third-party
background check service‚Äôs services or a background check provided to you by a
third-party background check service. [CLS] [SEP]

pages on the site may embed content and information provided by third-party
apis, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the site may include google maps features and
content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the [google
maps/google earth additional terms of
service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps/); and (2) the [google
privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). [CLS] [SEP] information on
company pages includes publicly available information and/or information
provided by the respective company and/or may come from third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, data about companies located in japan may come from toyo keizai
shinpo inc. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that while this agreement describes indeed‚Äôs services generally,
services may differ by availability, and you should check the site in your
location to see which services are available to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, while some
parts of this agreement describe matching services, indeed does not offer any
matching services in japan. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **2\. [CLS] [SEP] using our site**

when you use the site, you agree to indeed knowing, processing, analyzing, and
recording any and all activities you take on the site and any and all
interactions and communications you have with, on, or through the site,
including, but not limited to, knowing, processing, analyzing, and recording
which areas of the site you visit (including without limitation urls), which
content you view, which info you input, whether and where you click, scroll,
hover-over, mouseover, or otherwise interact with or communicate with or
through the site, the timing of each activity, and time spent on each
activity. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that indeed may use third-party vendors to create, store,
process, analyze, and record any and all such interactions, activities, and
communications made with, on, or through our site. [CLS] [SEP] the site cannot work as
indeed intends it to work unless indeed undertakes such activities. [CLS] [SEP] if you do
not want your actions to be processed, analyzed, or recorded this way, do not
use the site. [CLS] [SEP]

use of any automated system or software, whether operated by a third party or
otherwise, to extract data from the site (such as screen scraping or crawling)
is prohibited. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right to take such action as it considers
necessary, including issuing legal proceedings without further notice, in
relation to any unauthorized use of the site. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to make commercial
use of the site, if you wish to make use of the site in any capacity other
than that of a jobseeker or employer, or if you wish to purchase indeed
services that utilize the site, you must have a prior written agreement with
indeed to do so, or have accepted indeed‚Äôs online terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] please
[contact us](https://www.indeed.com/support/contact?hl=en&co=us) for more
information. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right at all times (but will not have any
obligation) to terminate users, and reclaim usernames or urls, for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **3\. [CLS] [SEP] user content**

some parts of the site, such as message boards and forums or job posting
pages, may allow users to post content like job listings, resumes,
information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any
such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes
available on or through the site, or any materials that a user submits to
indeed, including where it is stated that such materials may be posted on the
site or a third party website, including, but not limited to, mobile apps, are
referred to herein as ‚Äúuser content‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] such functionality is designed to help
users obtain career and company information, to let users know of jobs, to
provide information about potential job candidates, and facilitate other
communication. [CLS] [SEP] user content is provided by third-party contributors, many of
whom may use anonymous screen names. [CLS] [SEP] user content may be inaccurate,
incomplete, misleading or deceptive. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the site hosts company
pages, which allow user content to be posted by individuals that may not be
affiliated with the company who owns the company page, including but not
limited to the answers to q&a questions on company pages. [CLS] [SEP] indeed does not
endorse and is not responsible for any user content, including any opinion,
advice, information, or statement contained therein. [CLS] [SEP] some elements of indeed
job search results pages may appear to be content produced by indeed, but are
actually a reproduction of user-generated search queries. [CLS] [SEP] job ads or other
user content may be reformatted or include words such as ‚Äúpowered by indeed‚Äù. [CLS] [SEP]
such content retains its status as user content despite reformatting or
addition of ‚Äúpowered by indeed‚Äù or a similar phrase. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that by
accessing the site, you may come into contact with content (including user
content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or
objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other
potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that indeed shall have no
liability with respect to such content. [CLS] [SEP]

you must not post any user content that is unlawful, fraudulent,
discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or
otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other
discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. [CLS] [SEP]
you must also not post any user content that contains proprietary information,
trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements (other than job
advertisements permitted by this agreement), solicitations, chain letters,
pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial
communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or
encourages or causes spamming or flooding. [CLS] [SEP]

you are prohibited from posting any user content containing official
identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as
social security number, passport number, national identification number,
insurance number, driver‚Äôs license number, immigration number, or any other
similar number, code, or identifier. [CLS] [SEP] posting such identification information
may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may remove
any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to
do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting
of such identification information. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right to change the
display of resume on its site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields,
rearranging its format, and changing visual elements. [CLS] [SEP]

although indeed has no obligation to do so, indeed may monitor user content,
and reserves the right to delete any user content or portion thereof that, in
indeed‚Äôs sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any user content
that is unrelated to the specific portion of the site on which it is posted,
or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other
than job advertisements permitted by this agreement), or that indeed deems in
its sole discretion to be inappropriate. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may limit your use of the
site, including but not limited to, your ability to contact other employers or
job seekers. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that any user content violates this agreement or
our policies, please [contact
indeed](https://www.indeed.com/support/contact?hl=en&co=us) immediately so
that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and
agree that indeed does not have any obligation to host or remove any user
content, and i) the interpretation of whether any user content violates any
indeed policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any user
content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post
on indeed, will always remain within the sole discretion of indeed. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that indeed has no liability to you or anyone else arising from its editorial
decisions. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that indeed is an interactive computer
service and does not have any obligation to screen any user content, or to
include any user content (including without limitation job ads) in its search
results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any user content from
publication for any or no reason. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed reserves the right to disclose all user content and other relevant
information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any
third party in connection with operating the site; to protect itself, its
affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal
obligations or governmental requests. [CLS] [SEP] this means, for example, that indeed may
honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests
to reveal a user‚Äôs electronic address and identity, or other properly
requested information. [CLS] [SEP] when you post on indeed confidentially or otherwise
(e.g. [CLS] [SEP] anonymous company reviews or a confidential job ad), your identity may
be discoverable by legal request, including, but not limited to, requests from
the government or law enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, indeed reserves the right
(but is under no obligation) to remove any job listing that directly or
indirectly discriminates against job seekers. [CLS] [SEP] direct discrimination means, for
example, that a job listing specifically makes clear that only job seekers
matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of,
for example, their gender, race, age or disability. [CLS] [SEP] indirect discrimination
means, for example, that a job listing implicitly excludes certain classes of
job seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job
requirements. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to
refrain from posting any job listing that directly or indirectly discriminate
against job seekers or otherwise violate applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

please note: section 230 of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] communications decency act provides that:  
**(1) treatment of publisher or speaker**  
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the
publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information
content provider. [CLS] [SEP]  
**(2) civil liability**  
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on
account of-  
**(a)** any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or
availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,
lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise
objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or  
**(b)** any action taken to enable or make available to information content
providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material
described in paragraph (1). [CLS] [SEP]

#### **4\. [CLS] [SEP] license to user content and feedback**

only to the extent permitted by law, you grant indeed a nonexclusive,
worldwide, perpetual, (revocable only as described below), fully paid,

## indeed products terms of service

**last updated: ****february 26, 2021**









### indeed ads program terms





these indeed ads program terms (‚Äúiap terms‚Äù) form a part of, and are
incorporated into, the [indeed terms of
service](http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#terms) (the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù), and apply
to any employer who accesses or uses the indeed ads program, or who otherwise
indicates its acceptance of these indeed ads program terms. [CLS] [SEP]

any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these iap terms have
the meaning set forth in the agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **1\. [CLS] [SEP] the** program

use of the indeed ads program (‚Äúprogram‚Äù) on or through the site is subject to
all applicable indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the
[indeed privacy policy](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#privacypolicy)
and those instructions provided on the website, if you are using the ads
program, through our on-line forms. [CLS] [SEP] indeed policies may be modified at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] with regards to any job advertisements posted on indeed, either for
payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to indeed via an xml
feed (‚Äújob listings‚Äù or ‚Äújob ads‚Äù), you agree that you are solely responsible
for all: (a) ad or job content, including, but not limited to, job
descriptions and screener questions, or any other user content in the ad, and
target urls (‚Äúcreative‚Äù), whether generated by or for you, including but not
limited to photograph(s) you provide to indeed; and (b) websites proximately
reachable from creative urls and your services and products (collectively
‚Äúyour services‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] you shall protect your passwords and take full
responsibility for your own and any third party‚Äôs use of your accounts. [CLS] [SEP] job
ads may be placed on (y) any content, service, or property provided by indeed
(‚Äúindeed property‚Äù), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third
party (‚Äúpublisher‚Äù) upon which indeed places job ads or provides search
results of job listings (‚Äúpublisher property‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] indeed does not guarantee
performance or placement of job ads, and distribution on indeed property,
publisher properties, or other sites, including, but not limited to, mobile
apps, may vary depending on indeed‚Äôs consideration of various factors, such as
demand, industry, type of role, sponsorship, and other considerations. [CLS] [SEP]
placement of a job ad on a certain page (for example, on indeed gigs) is not a
representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes. [CLS] [SEP] the
placement of a job ad on indeed property, publisher properties, or other sites
is within indeed‚Äôs sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] by sponsoring a job ad, you are agreeing
to pay a price for each user ‚Äúclick‚Äù (a user action that results in a job
description being displayed to the user) that such an ad receives. [CLS] [SEP] click
prices may vary based on a variety of factors, including without limitation
the current supply and demand pertaining to advertisements and clicks, traffic
on the site, time of day, and other factors. [CLS] [SEP] by sponsoring a job ad you are
requesting that indeed manage the visibility of your job ads in the indeed
search engine results page to give your job exposure, in a way designed to
make the experience on indeed better for you and get your jobs better
visibility. [CLS] [SEP] ‚Äúexposure‚Äù does not always mean the job ad will get a particular
spot on the page, or that it will be called out with special wording, but
means that it will be placed by indeed in accordance with indeed judgment and
discretion in order to achieve what indeed determines, in its sole discretion,
to be the best visibility for such a job, considering the budget. [CLS] [SEP] by
sponsoring a job you are requesting indeed to manage this relative visibility
and exposure on its search engine results page. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that
such management of sponsored job ads is in indeed‚Äôs sole discretion and is
provided without warranty as to how and where indeed shall place such job ads. [CLS] [SEP]
you shall direct only to indeed any communications regarding job ads on
publisher properties. [CLS] [SEP] by posting or sponsoring a job ad on indeed, including
but not limited to by xml feed: you agree that indeed may and authorize indeed
to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the job ad on an indeed
hosted page or in its publisher network in any way indeed sees fit. [CLS] [SEP] all
dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open
an indeed reformatted or hosted page. [CLS] [SEP] in the event you provide indeed with an
indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as
determined by indeed, indeed may add a label (such as ‚Äúurgent‚Äù, ‚Äúurgently
hiring‚Äù or similar) next to the word ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù on the search results page
where your job ad is displayed. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may use words or phrases
interchangeably (for example, ‚Äúad‚Äù, ‚Äúurgently hiring‚Äù, ‚Äúpaid‚Äù, ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù,
‚Äúsponsored‚Äù, ‚Äúurgent‚Äù or similar) in connection with a sponsored advertisement
on indeed. [CLS] [SEP] job ads posted directly on indeed may no longer appear on the site
after a period of time; in some cases, these job ads may need to be sponsored
in order to remain visible or become visible again. [CLS] [SEP] however, job ads indexed
by indeed will expire after a period of time and indeed is unable to restore
their visibility. [CLS] [SEP] if you sponsor a job ad but do not provide a payment method
for your campaign, the job campaign will not begin and your job ad will not be
visible. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may in its sole discretion remove the budget and post the job
with organic visibility. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may require sponsorship for the display of any
job ad at any time for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may recommend or suggest a budget
for any job ad to maintain or optimize its visibility. [CLS] [SEP] the suggestion is made
without warranty and is not a guarantee regarding placement or visibility of
any job ad. [CLS] [SEP] if you are located in japan, you acknowledge that indeed‚Äôs content
moderation policies may, in some instances, result in the modification of your
job ad, and you agree to this activity. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an indeed agency partner,
you may be eligible to participate in an indeed partnership program. [CLS] [SEP] agency
partners in this program may attain the rank of ‚Äúgold‚Äù, ‚Äúsilver‚Äù, or ‚Äúbronze‚Äù
based on their indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue. [CLS] [SEP] indeed‚Äôs
determination of an agency‚Äôs rank is made at indeed‚Äôs full discretion and may
be revoked at any time. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may offer some employers who sponsor job ads
the opportunity to be displayed more prominently, or in an enhanced way, on
the site (‚Äúfeatured employer‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] featured employer is awarded at indeed‚Äôs sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the ability to receive featured employer, generally, is a function
of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend. [CLS] [SEP] a
featured employer may also receive subscriptions to the indeed resume program
for a limited time (‚Äúresume rewards‚Äù), which are awarded at indeed‚Äôs sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the featured employer program and resume rewards may be changed or
removed by indeed at any time, at indeed‚Äôs sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

**cost per apply.** indeed may offer a tool permitting an employer to set a
sponsored job advertising budget on a per-apply basis, referred to as either
‚Äúcost-per-apply‚Äù or ‚Äúpay-per-apply.‚Äù employers may be placed into a test group
and offered the cost-per-apply product by default. [CLS] [SEP] if you are placed in such a
test group and wish to purchase a cost-per-click advertising plan instead of
cost-per-apply, contact client success at 1-800-475-4361. [CLS] [SEP] charges are based on
applies (‚Äúapplies‚Äù or ‚Äúapply‚Äù), defined as an application to one of your job
ads delivered by indeed on the site. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may offer estimates regarding the
number of applies for a given budget; this information is based on estimates
only and is not a guarantee of future performance or of any particular number
of applies. [CLS] [SEP] by selecting a desired number of applies on the site, you are
requesting indeed to display your job ad in indeed‚Äôs sole discretion, using
the budget you have selected. [CLS] [SEP] you will be charged upon the earlier of a) your
ad campaign spending $500.00 or more or b) the beginning of the next calendar
month after you sponsor your job ad. [CLS] [SEP] if you previously purchased cost-per-
click sponsored jobs on the same account, you may also be charged once your
job ad campaign spends $25.00. [CLS] [SEP] the campaign for your job ad will automatically
pause after the number of applies you have selected are delivered. [CLS] [SEP] _**charges
are solely based on indeed‚Äôs apply measurements. [CLS] [SEP] indeed‚Äôs determination of
apply count shall be binding.**_ indeed and its affiliates, and its and their
third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning,
accuracy, or the levels or timing of: (i) costs per apply, (ii) delivery of
any applies, (iii) the interest level of any users who apply to or view your
job. [CLS] [SEP] indeed further disclaims all guarantees regarding analytics and
statistics provided to employers in the cost-per-apply test group, as such
information may be inaccurate or outdated during the test. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed may offer conversion tracking feature that employers may install on
their own websites (‚Äúconversion tracker‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] the conversion tracker will inform
indeed when a job seeker completes an application on the employer website,
allowing those applications to appear in the employer dashboard. [CLS] [SEP] by installing
or using a conversion tracker, you represent and warrant that you shall do so
in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation that you
shall provide users of your website with all necessary disclosures, and obtain
any necessary consent or agreement from such users, to permit the conversion
tracker to function in accordance with applicable law, and you agree to defend
and indemnify indeed from any failure to do so. [CLS] [SEP] the conversion tracker is
provided on an ‚Äúas-is‚Äù and ‚Äúas-available‚Äù basis, and without warranty. [CLS] [SEP] indeed
disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality,
reliability, or availability of the conversion tracker. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **2\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellation**

unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise
with indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time
(such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). [CLS] [SEP] indeed may
immediately cancel the program or these iap terms at any time upon notice. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed may modify the program or these iap terms at any time without liability
and your use of the program after notice that these iap terms have changed
indicates acceptance of the updated iap terms. [CLS] [SEP] sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will
survive any expiration or termination of these iap terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **3\. [CLS] [SEP] prohibited uses**

you shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated,
fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks; or (b) advertise
anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in
any state or country where your advertisement is displayed. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and
warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current; (y) you hold and
grant indeed and publishers all rights to copy, distribute and display
creative (‚Äúuse‚Äù); and (z) such use and websites linked from your jobs ads
(including your services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of
any applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] violation of these policies may result in immediate
termination of these iap terms or your account without notice, and may subject
you to legal penalties and consequences. [CLS] [SEP] indeed or publishers may reject or
remove any job ad, and indeed may disable any employer‚Äôs account, for any or
no reason without notice. [CLS] [SEP] although indeed may indicate why a job or account
has been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why a job or a
company may be removed, and we always retain the right to remove any job,
organic or sponsored, if we feel it is in our interest or our users‚Äô interest. [CLS] [SEP]
for examples of why indeed may reject such job ads from employers, refer to
[indeed‚Äôs search quality
policies](https://indeed.force.com/employersupport1/s/topic/0to1r000000drwcwaa/search-
quality?language=en_us), which are provided by way of illustration and are not
exhaustive. [CLS] [SEP]  **by submitting your job ad to indeed, you agree that indeed is
under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your job ad.** that decision
is entirely indeed‚Äôs in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]  the indeed team responsible for
maintaining the quality of the site is independent, and its decisions are
final and not subject to review. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may require some job ads to be
sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the job ad and/or the employer,
to prevent abuse of the free to post system, to improve our services, or for
any other reason in indeed‚Äôs sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may also limit the number
of free job ads you are allowed to post at a given time in indeed‚Äôs sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of
job ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a
confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-
fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer,
or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by
indeed. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, indeed may choose not to accept an employer‚Äôs xml feed
or any job ads in an xml feed for any or no reason. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a job board as
determined by indeed, indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or
all of your job ads. [CLS] [SEP] by submitting job ads to indeed, you agree that the
determination as to whether you are deemed to be a job board is made by indeed
in its sole discretion, and such decision is binding, and you agree that
indeed is under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your job ad. [CLS] [SEP] that
decision is entirely indeed‚Äôs in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the indeed team
responsible for maintaining the quality of the site is independent, and its
decisions are final and not subject to review. [CLS] [SEP] for examples of why indeed may
stop accepting such job ads from job boards, refer to the [job board inclusion
guidelines](https://indeedemployers.zendesk.com/hc/en-
us/articles/204575734-job-board-inclusion-guidelines). [CLS] [SEP] as a job board, you may
only post job ads on the site for your own company; you may not post job ads
on the site for your clients and if you do or attempt to do so, indeed
reserves the right to disable your account. [CLS] [SEP] indeed further reserves the right
to reject any job ads which advertise staffing opportunities or platforms
rather than actual jobs. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation
of these guidelines on the indeed site may harm indeed and its users. [CLS] [SEP] when you
create an indeed account, indeed may require that you verify your identity
through a third party service called mitek. [CLS] [SEP] by using mitek, you are submitting
your identification documents for verification directly to mitek, you are
agreeing to share your identification with mitek, and you agree that mitek is
solely responsible for any use or loss of data. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may have access to your
identification documents via mitek. [CLS] [SEP]

### indeed resume/cv program terms





these indeed resume program terms or indeed cv program terms (collectively,
‚Äúirp terms‚Äù) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the [indeed terms of
service](http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#terms) (the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù), and apply
to any employer that accesses or uses the indeed resume program, or that
otherwise indicates its acceptance of these indeed resume program terms. [CLS] [SEP]

any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these irp terms have
the meaning set forth in the agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **1\. [CLS] [SEP] the program**

use of the indeed resume program (‚Äúprogram‚Äù) by an individual who posts his or
her resume on the site (hereinafter, ‚Äúresume owner‚Äù) or employer on or through
the site is subject to all applicable indeed best-practice guidelines,
policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including
through the site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the faq and
information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription for, any
or all of which may be modified at any time. [CLS] [SEP] purchasing additional
subscriptions or modifying subscriptions may reset the monthly billing date
for subscriptions associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges
to account for the new date. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not use any information obtained from
the site except for internal use in selecting and contacting resume owners,
through indeed, for purposes of filling your job listings. [CLS] [SEP] contact information
provided by indeed, including any relay service email address, is for your
individual use only and may not be shared with any other person. [CLS] [SEP] you are
expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the
information from a resume, in order to circumvent the resume contact system. [CLS] [SEP]
use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the program. [CLS] [SEP]
in addition, as a feature of the irp, indeed may send emails to job seekers on
your behalf indicating that your job listing is potentially a match for the
job seeker‚Äôs resume. [CLS] [SEP]

important notice : you expressly agree that: in purchasing or obtaining access
to the program, you are paying indeed the amount indicated on the site for the
purpose of indeed facilitating your contact with a resume owner by sending a
message to the email address that the relevant resume owner has provided to
indeed, or by connecting you via phone call to the number provided by the
resume owner. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the program is subject to all indeed site rules and
policies, including the indeed privacy policy and any policies pertaining to
relay services. [CLS] [SEP] indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in
use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that
such message will be acted upon by any potential resume owner, or that any
resume owner‚Äôs resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect. [CLS] [SEP] **indeed
may return different results for the same resume search query and has full
discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to
any particular search.** ** ** in addition, in accord with the agreement, you
expressly agree that indeed does not allow its resume contact service to be
used in a spam like manner, which indeed defines as sending requests for job
positions to persons who are, as indicated by indeed experience and resume
owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right
to disable indeed resume contact service for any user who, in indeed‚Äôs sole
discretion, violates these irp terms, including the foregoing term. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve

or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other
messages that indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no
reason. [CLS] [SEP] **the only acceptable use of the irp is for you to contact a resume
owner through indeed regarding a job listing or potential employment. [CLS] [SEP] no other
uses of the irp are permitted. [CLS] [SEP]  **scraping the indeed resume database or using
the indeed resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result
in legal action being taken against you. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, if you are a competitor
of indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job
posting websites) you may not use the indeed resume database to contact a
resume owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients,
and any such competitive use of the indeed resume database may result in
indeed blocking you from the site, blocking you from contacting indeed resume
owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice
and you consent to the same. [CLS] [SEP] each resume subscription is solely for the
individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared
with other users. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may limit the number of devices each account is
logged into it. [CLS] [SEP]

**in the event phone numbers are provided by the job seeker in the resume,
indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such
numbers are landlines or cell phones. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to call job seekers regarding
relevant job opportunities only. [CLS] [SEP] it is your sole responsibility to comply with
all tcpa guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing
systems.**

information contained in job seeker resumes is self-reported by job seekers
and is not verified by indeed. [CLS] [SEP] any filtering, sorting, or ranking tools
available to you as part of the resume program rely on this self-reported
information. [CLS] [SEP] the appearance of a given job seeker‚Äôs resume in search results
is not a guarantee that the job seeker has the attributes or experience you
have selected. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **2\. [CLS] [SEP] cancellation**

such request. [CLS] [SEP] cancellation of your use of the irp shall be in accordance with

you represent and warrant that all information you provide to indeed is
correct and current. [CLS] [SEP] you represent to indeed that you are an employer

### indeed assessments terms





these indeed assessments terms (‚Äúia terms‚Äù) form a part of, and are
incorporated into, the [indeed terms of
service](http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#terms) (the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] by using
indeed assessments as an employer in any way, or by registering as an employer
on indeed assessments, you agree to these indeed assessments terms and the
indeed terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] any capitalized terms that are used but not defined
in these ia terms have the meaning set forth in the agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction

indeed assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills
assessments selected by employers (‚Äúassessments‚Äù) and responses from job
seekers  (‚Äúresponses‚Äù) through the site. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] assessments

you agree that any assessment sent by indeed to a job seeker is done so at
your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that job
seeker‚Äôs consent for indeed to contact that job seeker for the purpose of
transmitting the assessment(s) you have selected. [CLS] [SEP] you also acknowledge that
once you have requested that indeed transmit your assessment to a job seeker,
that request cannot be canceled. [CLS] [SEP] indeed does not guarantee that any job seeker
will receive, access, read or respond to any assessment, or that there will be
no mistakes in the transmission of the data. [CLS] [SEP] however, indeed may alert you
when any of the above events occur. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree you have made the determination to use indeed assessments as part of
your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any
assessment or bundle of assessments you send to a job seeker are solely being
asked by you and are not being asked by indeed. [CLS] [SEP] you agree you are solely
responsible for the use of assessments and responses in compliance with the
law, including the fair credit reporting act and similar state statutes. [CLS] [SEP] you
are solely responsible for your use of indeed assessments, including without
limitation any results which are considered to have a ‚Äúdisparate impact.‚Äù you
further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods
of screening, if so required by the americans with disabilities act or any
other equivalent state act. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that indeed may, but is not
obligated to, provide a means by which job seekers may request such an
alternative method or other accommodation from you. [CLS] [SEP] while indeed is guided by
wcag 2.1, level aa in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings,
as outlined in the accessibility statement, indeed does not warrant that the
method of delivery of any assessment question is compliant with the americans
with disabilities act or any equivalent or similar law. [CLS] [SEP]

you are the sole party to determine which assessment to send to any job
seeker. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that an assessment is only designed to evaluate a particular
skill. [CLS] [SEP] it does not evaluate a job seeker‚Äôs qualification for any job nor their
ability to safely perform a job. [CLS] [SEP] whether a particular skill is relevant to a
job, or whether a job seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided
solely by you. [CLS] [SEP] indeed reserves the right to change any assessment or the
questions asked within an assessment at any time, for any or no reason,
including but not limited to quality control. [CLS] [SEP]

sending an assessment to a job seeker does not guarantee a response or any
further communication or action by any job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] you consent to your
assessment and any other communications sent through indeed assessments being
processed and analyzed by indeed according to this agreement and indeed‚Äôs
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] responses

a job seeker may, but is not required to, provide a response to an assessment
sent by an employer. [CLS] [SEP] after a job seeker has provided a response, the employer
will be able to use the indeed assessments platform to review the response. [CLS] [SEP] a
job seeker may also have the option to select an assessment and associate the
response with their indeed profile, which will be visible to employers in
accordance with our terms. [CLS] [SEP] if there are multiple versions of the same
assessment, the response percentile for any job seeker will be determined only
in relation to other responses to the same version of that assessment. [CLS] [SEP]

as an employer you are the sole party to determine whether a response
indicates a qualified job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] you may instruct indeed to send out
rejection notices if the job seeker has not responded to assessments in a
manner acceptable to you, and you acknowledge that indeed has no discretion in
the transmission of these rejections. [CLS] [SEP] as the employer, you are the sole party
to determine whether to offer a job seeker the  opportunity to retake any
assessment that you sent or update or modify their response. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that responses are only provided on the condition
that you use them responsibly and legally as part of your hiring process,
which includes considering any other relevant information about the job
seeker. [CLS] [SEP] indeed may display excerpts from or summaries of responses in other
products such as indeed resume. [CLS] [SEP] these summaries are for convenience only and
are not to be used in lieu of the full response in context. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to
rely solely on such excerpts or summaries when making a hiring decision
regarding any job seeker. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] rules for using indeed assessments

as an employer, you represent and warrant that you shall not access or use
indeed assessments for any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or
fraudulent purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not create or send any assessment which is
directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, fraudulent, threatening,
abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that
contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that
contains no relevant or constructive content. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not create or send any
assessment containing proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential
information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes,
investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication
(except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing). [CLS] [SEP]

indeed assessments is not a tool to ask for sensitive personal data from job
seekers. [CLS] [SEP] employers may not create or send any assessment which seeks highly
confidential personal information from job seekers, such as bank account or
credit card information, online account information, social security numbers
(or similar counterparts outside the united states of america), health
information, or other categories of personal data subject to data breach
notification requirements in any country. [CLS] [SEP]

an employer who receives an accommodation request through indeed assessments
must provide an accommodation to the extent required by applicable law, and
further must provide evidence of compliance to indeed immediately upon
request. [CLS] [SEP] any failure to fulfill these obligations is a material breach of this
agreement and indeed may immediately terminate your account and your access to
indeed assessments with no further obligation to you. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to defend and
indemnify indeed from any claims arising from your failure to comply with this
section. [CLS] [SEP]

**_you understand and agree that indeed does not have any obligation to screen
any assessment or response, or to publish any assessment or response on the
site, and may exclude or remove any assessment or response from the site for
any or no reason without liability or notice._**

#### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] indeed‚Äôs role

indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the indeed assessments
tool. [CLS] [SEP] by using indeed assessments, you acknowledge and agree that indeed is
not procuring employees for employers or procuring opportunities to work for
job seekers. [CLS] [SEP] indeed merely provides a tool enabling employers and job seekers
to exchange assessments and responses as they determine. [CLS] [SEP] the sole
responsibility for the content of any assessment or response, any requests for
interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of
employment, and any other issues arising from the use of indeed assessments,

other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment
to a job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for complying with all laws and
regulations relating to the intended employment of any job seeker. [CLS] [SEP] further,
for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist,
assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and
do not speak to whether a job seeker is qualified for or has such a license or
certification. [CLS] [SEP] it is the employer‚Äôs sole responsibility to determine what
licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a job seeker
has such license or certification. [CLS] [SEP] indeed also makes no statement as to
whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an employer‚Äôs sole
responsibility to make such a determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel
to do so), in accordance with the eeoc regulations or other applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed is not a party to, third party beneficiary of, or liable for, any
agreements, offers, or promises between an employer and job seeker, regardless
of whether indeed receives a fee from the employer in connection with the
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of
or related to such transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the

confidential. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that (1) you will use any content submitted by job
seekers only in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws;

job seekers outside of your recruiting or hiring department; and (3) you will
take appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect
content you obtain through use of indeed assessments from loss, misuse,
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. [CLS] [SEP]

products, and services available on or through indeed assessments, are
provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis, with no warranties

indeed assessments or the site; (c) your loss of, or disclosure of,

service](http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#terms) (the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù), and apply
to any employer who accesses or uses the indeed targeted ads program, or who
otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ita terms. [CLS] [SEP]  these ita terms apply
to both of indeed‚Äôs targeted ads services: 1) indeed targeted ads: brand (‚Äúita
brand‚Äù) and 2) indeed targeted ads: apply (‚Äúita apply‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP]

any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ita terms have
the meaning set forth in the agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] the program

use of indeed targeted ads (‚Äúita‚Äù) on or through the site is subject to all
applicable indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the [indeed
privacy policy](https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/indeed#privacypolicy) and
those instructions provided on the site, and, if you are using ita, through
our online forms. [CLS] [SEP] indeed policies may be modified at any time. [CLS] [SEP] with regards to
any job or brand advertisements posted on or through indeed through ita,
(‚Äútargeted ads‚Äù), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or
job content and target urls, or any other user content in the ads
(‚Äúcreative‚Äù), whether provided or generated by or for you, irrespective of
whether it is reformatted or the words ‚Äúpowered by indeed‚Äù or similar phrasing
appear on the ad; including but not limited to images, photograph(s), text,
marks, logos, video, or audio you provide to indeed; and (b) websites
proximately reachable from creative urls and your services and products
(collectively ‚Äúyour services‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] you shall protect your passwords and take full
responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that targeted ads and creatives may be placed on any site, content, or
property provided by indeed (‚Äúindeed property‚Äù) or may be placed on a third
party website, including, but not limited to, mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP] by posting a
targeted ad on or through indeed, you authorize indeed to reformat the job ad. [CLS] [SEP]
indeed may reformat the job ad, for example, so that the ad can be effectively
displayed on a mobile device, a third party website, or certain locations on
the site. [CLS] [SEP] indeed makes no guarantees and disclaims all liability and
warranties as to the content or nature of third party websites, including, but
not limited to, mobile apps, on which targeted ads may appear. [CLS] [SEP] target audience

its sole discretion, the frequency or number of times an ad is displayed to
members of a target audience. [CLS] [SEP]

**ita apply:** in order to participate in ita apply, you must either use
indeed apply to receive applications or add indeed‚Äôs conversion tracker
snippet to the last page of your job application, also known as the post-apply
page (the ‚Äúpost-apply page‚Äù). [CLS] [SEP] the post-apply page on which you add indeed‚Äôs
conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you
and indeed. [CLS] [SEP] however, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion
tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in
violation of this agreement, indeed will still count this page as the post-
apply-page, charge you for any applies (as defined below) on this page, and
may require you to correct the placement. [CLS] [SEP] any removal of the tracker snippet,
or any provision of a method, for job seekers to apply to the job ad,
bypassing the conversion tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program
and will entitle indeed to any resulting damages. [CLS] [SEP] it shall be your
responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in
place. [CLS] [SEP] the conversion tracker will attribute an application to indeed any time
the job seeker started their search on indeed, despite any intervening
activity. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, if you receive the ita apply services, you may be
given the option to include application questions for your job listing on an
ita ad as part of your application process. [CLS] [SEP] if you request that indeed include
