information specifically and on what legal grounds we base the use of your
personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

### activities & purposes

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **service** : the most important reason for using your personal information is, of course, to offer you our services as mentioned in our [terms of service](/legal/terms), for example to create or visualize your content or share your ideas and to let you access and use your content across different devices. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] **support** : we provide a wide range of support services to help you out whenever you’re in need, for instance when you need technical assistance. [CLS] [SEP] if it’s needed to offer support, the support-team can, on your request, access your content in order to help you out. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] **account & billing**: creating and upholding your personal account for example to facilitate your address book and to enable you to access your content across different devices, facilitating payment of your subscription fee and perform accounting, auditing & billing activities. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] **safety, integrity & security**: wetransfer follows up on abuse reports, ntd/dmca reports, fraud investigations and could investigate your compliance with our of our [terms of services](/legal/terms) and/or api terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, we detect & block child sexual abuse imagery (csai). [CLS] [SEP] detection of csai leads to automated decisions whether such content is potential csai. [CLS] [SEP] cases of potential csai will be reported directly to law enforcement agencies. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, we protect ourselves against fraud and other illegal activities. [CLS] [SEP] in all these cases we withhold the right to preserve your content and share it, together with other identifying information, with law enforcement agencies. [CLS] [SEP] finally, we could use your personal information for internal control to safeguard our and your safety, integrity and security. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, in case of any suspicion of violations of our terms of services or the api terms of use. [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] **improvement & development**: we evaluate the use of our services to improve our services, fix bugs, develop new products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we do this either by market research (for instance by sending out surveys) or by performing analyses (for example by tracking and bringing together your personal information across our services or across your mobile devices). [CLS] [SEP] we do this in order to understand how our user base as a whole interacts with our services, but also to review the effect of our advertisements and to improve those services and advertisements accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] **marketing, advertisement & communication**: we use your personal information for marketing and (interest based) advertising for instance by using sdks or cookies, as well as communication. [CLS] [SEP] think updates on new services, but also personalised advertisements of wetransfer or our partners, which we can serve on our or third party websites. [CLS] [SEP] in order to find the right audience for these advertisements we will look at certain segments of people. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, people who use similar services as ours, people who share the same characteristics as our current users or people within a certain geo-location, such as the amsterdam area. [CLS] [SEP] in order to connect with our target audience, we might use sequential messaging, which is basically a form of storytelling: each time you interact with our services on a different device, you may receive a slightly different ad in a different form, but the ads are part of the same story. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, based on the way you interact with our services through your devices, we might promote one of our (other) services or features. [CLS] [SEP] finally, we enable you to engage in any (personalised) actions, promotions or events we offer. [CLS] [SEP]
  7. [CLS] [SEP] **legal** : in so far as necessary, we might use your personal information to defend wetransfer in legal proceedings in relation to or as a result of your use of our services, following a court order, abiding by any law, regulation or governmental request, cooperating with law enforcement, cooperating in fraud investigations of third parties, safeguarding national security, defense, public security, and to uphold our terms of services. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] for our innovative interests as mentioned under 5. [CLS] [SEP] and finally for our (direct) marketing, brand interests under 6 and legal & compliance interests as stated under 7.

## what parties do we share personal information with?

wetransfer has several partners to operate and improve its services. [CLS] [SEP]
furthermore, we may share or allow you to share your information as part of
some of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **service providers** : such as our hosting provider, user support provider, it & software providers, our payment processors, email processors and the accountant. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] **people and (social) media of your choice** : you may choose to share your content with others, such as teammates, within our services or on (social) media like twitter. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] **law enforcement agencies or regulators** : we are obliged to share your personal information in case of a legal request. [CLS] [SEP] in case we run across csai or when we’re notified on other illegal content we’ll also share your personal information with law enforcement agencies. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] **business partners** : we collaborate with advertising partners, marketing and communication agencies. [CLS] [SEP] we do this for (interest based) advertising, branding and reaching out to you. [CLS] [SEP] our advertising partners implement their own tracking cookies which fall under their terms of services and privacy & cookie statement. [CLS] [SEP] please find a list of all third party cookies and their privacy policies [here](https://we.tl/cookielist). [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] **integrated services** : if you decide to integrate (one of) our services with another service (such as slack or your social media account) we will connect that service with ours. [CLS] [SEP] in order to provide such service, we will need to share some of your personal information with that service. [CLS] [SEP] the terms and privacy & cookie statement of these third parties applies, at least for their part of the connection. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] **wetransfer entities** : we share personal information between entities which are part of the wetransfer group in order to provide our services and for all purposes mentioned under “why do we use your personal information?”. [CLS] [SEP]

we’re a global business, which means we might share or store personal
information in countries outside of the european economic area (“eea”). [CLS] [SEP] those
countries have different data protection laws in place. [CLS] [SEP] however, when we
transfer- and host data globally, we will make sure that appropriate
safeguards are in place in order to ensure your personal information enjoys a
similar level of protection as it would within the eea. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we will
verify that the receiving partner is certified under eu-us privacy shield or
we will sign eu standard contractual clauses. [CLS] [SEP]

**eu-us privacy shield**

our subsidiary in the united states, wetransfer corp, complies with the eu-us
privacy shield framework as set forth by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce
regarding the use and retention of personal information transferred from the
european economic area and the united kingdom to the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

wetransfer corp adheres to the eu-us privacy shield principles and is subject
to oversight by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal trade commission. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any complaints
regarding the transfer of your personal information to the us, please first
file them directly at us via
[legal@wetransfer.com](mailto:legal@wetransfer.com). [CLS] [SEP] the panel of eu data
protection authorities (dpa panel) acts as the independent recourse mechanism
for complaints regarding eu-us privacy shield complaints. [CLS] [SEP] the examination of
such complaints is free of charge to you. [CLS] [SEP] you can find the contact information
of your local dpa [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). [CLS] [SEP]
in case your concern still isn’t addressed by the dpa panel, you may be
entitled to invoke binding arbitration under the eu-us privacy shield
principles, find out more [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=how-
to-submit-a-complaint). [CLS] [SEP]

as explained under section "what parties do we share personal information
with", we sometimes provide personal information with third parties to perform
services on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if we transfer personal information received under the
privacy shield to a third party, the third party’s use of the personal data
must also comply with our privacy shield obligations. [CLS] [SEP] in such a case we will
remain liable under privacy shield for any failure to comply by the third
party, unless we prove we’re not responsible for the event giving rise to the
damage. [CLS] [SEP]

you can find our certification [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list). [CLS] [SEP] to
learn more about eu-us privacy shield visit: <https://www.privacyshield.gov>. [CLS] [SEP]

## why and how are cookies used?

we place cookies with the intention of making wetransfer even better. [CLS] [SEP] we work
hard to make our services safe, beautiful and unobtrusive. [CLS] [SEP] feel free to block
cookies, but this may affect how well our services work. [CLS] [SEP]

we place several cookies (or similar technologies, like pixels or web beacons)
on your device for the purpose of facilitating your use of the service and to
find out how the service may be improved. [CLS] [SEP] we or our advertising partners also
place cookies on our website(s). [CLS] [SEP] being a global service, these partners can
vary per country. [CLS] [SEP] when our advertising partners place cookies, these cookies
can process personal information to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by your browser
when you visit a website. [CLS] [SEP] examples of cookie purposes are: your language
preferences, logging into an account, remembering login details, serving you
personalised advertisements and acceptance of the terms of service and privacy
& cookie statement. [CLS] [SEP] our website can place these cookies for the following
purposes:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **functional cookies** are used to provide functionalities when using our service, such as the possibility to set preferences or to remember your previous settings. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] **analytical cookies** are used to optimise our service. [CLS] [SEP] for example to optimise the usability of our website by ab-testing a new feature, to make the website more user-friendly and to analyse how you use our service. [CLS] [SEP] we also use analytical cookies to stop bots and malicious behaviour like spam. [CLS] [SEP] when we use analytical cookies, this could include third party cookies, as found in the cookie list. [CLS] [SEP] these third party analytical cookies process personal information, which is detailed in the cookie list too. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] **advertisement cookies** are used for commercial, editorial and promotional purposes. [CLS] [SEP] with these cookies your internet- and surf behaviour can be followed over various domains and websites. [CLS] [SEP] wetransfer only checks the (one) website you visited prior to your visit to one of our websites. [CLS] [SEP] we do not track the website you visit after you leave our website. [CLS] [SEP] advertisement cookies are often also placed by third parties to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and to follow your internet- and surf behaviour over other domains and websites where they have placed a cookie. [CLS] [SEP] wetransfer does not have access to or control over personal information collected via these cookies or other features that advertisers and third parties may use. [CLS] [SEP] our privacy & cookie statement is therefore not applicable to these third party cookies and we refer you to third parties’ privacy statements to read how they handle personal information. [CLS] [SEP] you can find a list of the limited amount of third party cookies and a link to their privacy policies [here](https://we.tl/cookielist). [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] **pixel tags or web beacons** are a piece of code embedded on the website that collects personal information about users' engagement on that web page. [CLS] [SEP] the use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. [CLS] [SEP] the pixel also allows us to see from which previous website or channel a user arrived at our website. [CLS] [SEP]

we have an extensive cookie list available [here](https://we.tl/cookielist),
which we will update at least four times a year. [CLS] [SEP] due to the changing nature of
our service, this may result in the cookie list not being fully up to date at
times. [CLS] [SEP] if you would want to remove certain cookies, or block them from being
stored in your browser, it is possible to arrange this through your browser
settings for cookies. [CLS] [SEP] you can find these settings under the privacy tab in the
preferences section of most browsers. [CLS] [SEP] here you can specify your cookie
preferences or remove cookies. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you remove or refuse
wetransfer cookies, the service might not function in optimal form. [CLS] [SEP]

## can you use wetransfer for private or sensitive files?

we treat your content with respect. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t provide any public search
function, catalogue or listing to find content. [CLS] [SEP] we trust you understand that
in order to fulfill our moral responsibility to reduce the spread of child
sexual abuse imagery (csai), we do use automated systems to to detect such
content. [CLS] [SEP] finally, we’re obliged to delete your content when we receive a
notice-and-takedown/dmca-request or when we receive a legal request. [CLS] [SEP]

please be mindful when distributing download/ access links - whoever it is
passed on to or has access to a download/access link can access or download
the content. [CLS] [SEP] for extra security and confidentiality you might want to use our
feature to protect your files with a password (if available). [CLS] [SEP]

## what retention procedures are in place?

the retention period for your personal information depends on which service
you use and it depends on which category of personal information we’re talking
about. [CLS] [SEP] always check out the website(s) or app(s) of the service(s) for the
specific information on retention periods. [CLS] [SEP]

**personal information**

wetransfer retains your personal information as long as its necessary to
provide our services to you (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] upholding your user account), to conduct our
business activities and fulfill our legitimate interests, such as providing
safe and secure services, to fix bugs and to reach out to you, to comply with
applicable laws (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] retaining financial information for 7 years for tax
purposes) and legal requests and to resolve (legal) disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

**files you transfer**

when using wetransfer file sharing your content will be deleted after 7 days,
unless you have a pro account in which case your transfer data is stored by
default for 28 days or until the expiry date you set manually. [CLS] [SEP] after this
period, a file is automatically deleted from our servers. [CLS] [SEP] the personal
information that accompanies your transfer is kept for a maximum of 12 months. [CLS] [SEP]
such personal information is only accessible to very few people within
wetransfer, those that need it to perform their job, for example to provide
you with support. [CLS] [SEP] when data is older than 12 months, we scrub it from the
database, pseudonymise or anonymise it for analysis. [CLS] [SEP] pseudonomising your
personal information means that we do not use your email address or ip address
for analytical purposes, but create a random pseudonym for both and use that
pseudonym instead. [CLS] [SEP] that way we don’t have to handle directly identifiable
personal information, which is privacy-friendly. [CLS] [SEP]

**content you create, use, store or share through the services other than file
sharing**

the content you create, use, store or share on our services, other than our
file sharing service, is, in principle, retained until you stop interacting
with our service(s), when you delete your content from the service(s), when
you delete the service(s) from your device(s) or when you delete your account. [CLS] [SEP]
always check out the website(s) or app(s) of the service(s) you use for
specific information. [CLS] [SEP]

## how safe is it to use our services?

wetransfer takes technical and organisational measures to protect your
personal information against loss or other forms of unlawful processing. [CLS] [SEP]

we make sure that personal information is only accessible by those who need
access to do their job and that they are properly authorised. [CLS] [SEP] that means we
keep logs of who has access to personal information, we limit the amount of
people that have access and we make sure that personal information can only be
read, copied, modified or removed by properly authorised staff. [CLS] [SEP] we monitor
internal activity to ensure the safety and accuracy of personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

wetransfer staff is required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with
the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, ethics, and appropriate
usage of personal information. [CLS] [SEP] staff is required to sign a confidentiality
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

servers we use to store your content for you are gdpr compliant and secure. [CLS] [SEP]

you have a right to object to our use of your personal information, for
instance when the legal base for processing is based on one of our legitimate
interests (see subsection “legal grounds”). [CLS] [SEP] if you inform us that you do not
longer wish us to process your personal information or to be approached,
