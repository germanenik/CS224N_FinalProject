1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction

researchgate gmbh, chausseestraße 20, 10115 berlin, germany ("
**researchgate** ", " **we** ", " **us** ", or " **our** ") provides the
services rendered to you through the researchgate website available at
https://www.researchgate.net, and through any of its web pages and associated
applications which may be available on multiple devices, including mobile
applications (" **service** "). [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy sets forth the collection and use practices of
researchgate for personal data we process in the course of providing the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

our mission is to connect the world of science and make research open to all. [CLS] [SEP]
connections can only be established when potential connections and
commonalities are known and connecting lines can be drawn. [CLS] [SEP] openness can only
be achieved with comprehensive accessibility. [CLS] [SEP] our service takes your work and
activities on the service into account to help connect you with other
individuals who are relevant to you and recommend relevant content. [CLS] [SEP] we also
gather information from external sources, in order to disseminate as much
relevant scientific content as possible to drive science forward. [CLS] [SEP] any natural
or legal person who, as a recipient of the service, accesses or uses the
service for any purpose is a user (" **user** ", " **you** "). [CLS] [SEP] our registered
users (" **members** ") share their professional identities and credentials,
display their academic publications, engage and collaborate with their
networks, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant
content, and discover business and career opportunities. [CLS] [SEP] some content is also
visible to unregistered or logged-out users (" **visitors** "). [CLS] [SEP] a user could
be a member or a visitor. [CLS] [SEP] an author (" **author** ") is a natural person who,
for the purpose of our service, is a member of the scientific community by for
example being an author/editor of a publication, being an advisor or recipient
of scientific funding. [CLS] [SEP] an author is not necessarily a user or member of our
service. [CLS] [SEP]

researchgate reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, in
particular, to reflect changes in market conditions affecting researchgate’s
activities, changes in technology, changes in relevant laws and regulatory
requirements, and changes in researchgate’s system capabilities. [CLS] [SEP] if we make
material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify members by email or
other reasonable means, including through notifications on our service. [CLS] [SEP] if you
object to any new version, you should stop using our service and/or close your
account. [CLS] [SEP] if you continue to use our service after having been provided with
such notice you will be deemed to have acknowledged the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

2\. [CLS] [SEP] information we process and how we process it

  1. [CLS] [SEP]  **basic data processed**

certain data will be processed when you access the service, to resolve the
technical request of your device, display the site and maintain the safety and
security of our systems. [CLS] [SEP] this data is stored in so-called logs and comprise
the following:

    * ip addresses and your mobile device's identifier for advertising (idfa);

    * the type of computer or mobile device you are using including operating system and version;

    * the types of browser you are using, the language, and your country;

    * referring and exit pages and urls;

    * platform type;

    * the number of clicks on a page or feature, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages or parts of pages;

    * domain names and;

    * information collected for performance purposes (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] average load, render time of pages, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

even though ip addresses and mobile identifiers are generally considered
personal data, we can not derive any direct conclusions about your identity
from such data. [CLS] [SEP]

our legal basis for processing this personal data is article 6 (1)(f) of the
general data protection regulation (gdpr). [CLS] [SEP] the data processed is very basic
data, and does not contain directly identifiable information about you. [CLS] [SEP] we
have a legitimate interest in being able to provide a functioning, reliable
and accessible website and resolve your server-request in an appropriate
manner. [CLS] [SEP]

all of our pages are secured using ssl (secure socket layer) technology, which
encrypts data transmitted between our servers and your end devices. [CLS] [SEP] we also
apply other suitable technical and organizational measures to protect your
personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP]  **personal data we process**

in order to provide you with functionalities, we need to process certain data
and/or information relating to you:

    *  **registration and maintenance of your member account**

if you choose to create a member account on our service, you will be required,
during the registration process, to provide your first and last name, an email
address, and a password. [CLS] [SEP] you will receive a confirmation email. [CLS] [SEP] your member
account will be confirmed after you have clicked on the respective link in the
account activation email. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be invited to associate certain
information we present to you with your account, such as articles,
institutional affiliation, and biographical information. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **other personal data**

during the registration process or when updating your profile, you can choose
to provide other information that can be used to identify and/or contact you,
including for example, a profile picture, your twitter account handle or your
city of residence. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be invited or required to provide information
about you, including, for example, demographic information, such as
occupation, and research vita, education, authorship of articles, academic or
research expertise or interests, conferences you have attended, groups of
which you are a member, information regarding your professional and academic
career, academic degree, your previous roles and jobs. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **third-party connectors**

you can choose to create an account using your facebook, linkedin or google
account and subsequently use that third-party platform’s credentials to log in
to your researchgate account. [CLS] [SEP] using this option means that you are allowing
researchgate to request and use certain data from the third-party account. [CLS] [SEP] for
google, this involves us processing your email address. [CLS] [SEP] for linkedin, we will
process your email address, first and last name, and profile picture. [CLS] [SEP] for
facebook, we will process your email address and public profile information. [CLS] [SEP]
the third-party platform might ask for your consent to share this data with
researchgate. [CLS] [SEP] as the personal data we might process was originally collected
by the third-party platform, the initial data processing and sharing of the
data with researchgate are governed by the privacy policy of such third-party
platform. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to the relevant third-party platform and/or its
settings, if you want to deactivate the connection between researchgate and
the third-party platform. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **communications with us**

when you communicate with us, you may provide us with your name, contact
details, and other personal data as part of your communication, as well as the
content of your message itself. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, when we communicate with you, we
will process your personal information, such as your email address. [CLS] [SEP] for some
of our emails, we also process information indicating whether you have opened
the email. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **communications through the service**

many communications that you initiate through our service (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] invitation
sent to a non-member) will list your name in the header of the message. [CLS] [SEP] other
communications that you initiate through the service, like a request for a
full-text, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your
personal email address. [CLS] [SEP] once you have mutually connected with an individual,
contact information you choose to include in your researcher profile will be
shared with that individual. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **recommendations**

in order to provide our recommendation features, we process contact and
bibliographical data, information pertaining to your work, usage frequency,
type of devices you use to use the service, including browser, operating
system and mobile device, research items you consulted, interaction with
particular pages or parts of pages, and number of clicks on a page or feature,
in order to provide the service in a way that is tailored to your interests. [CLS] [SEP]
also, based on the personal data you provide, statistical evaluations,
mathematic operations, and predictions may help us infer other information
about you and support our recommendation features. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you were to
add several research items to the service over the course of several years, we
may infer that you are not a junior researcher anymore. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **third party providers**

when you choose to benefit from a service or offer presented by researchgate
on behalf of a third party, you may share personal data with researchgate to
enable us to pass it on to the third party. [CLS] [SEP] the nature of personal data will
depend on the particular service or offer, but might include your name, email
address and affiliation. [CLS] [SEP] we do not share any of this personal data with any
third party unless you explicitly allow us to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **payment data**

if you choose to purchase a premium product or service from researchgate that
is subject to a fee, we will process the personal data that you provide in
order to complete your order, such as your billing address. [CLS] [SEP] researchgate does
not process any credit card information itself, however we do retain your name
and address so we may generate and send you an invoice. [CLS] [SEP] credit card
information is collected and processed by a third-party provider, namely
stripe. [CLS] [SEP] stripe processes this data as an independent controller to process the
payment. [CLS] [SEP] for details about the data processing undertaken by stripe, please
see its [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/de/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **security**

we process the number of profile pages users view to detect and prevent data
harvesting. [CLS] [SEP] we also process your ip address to filter out suspicious requests. [CLS] [SEP]
if you are a member, we store your full ip address in connection with your
account registration request and your current last login. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, your
login activities are only stored in connection with your truncated ip
addresses. [CLS] [SEP] also, we process information about the device, its operating system
and the browser you are using for your current session. [CLS] [SEP]

    *  **statistics**

we use activity data, such as number of read publications, projects and number
of citations, to generate statistics, which pertain to reading behavior or
achievements. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may use such activity data in order to calculate
and display a read count on an individual publication page. [CLS] [SEP]

3\. [CLS] [SEP] how we use data we collect about you

the following explanations will provide you with information about how we use
the personal data that we collect about you, and our legal basis for doing so
under the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] generally speaking, we may, pursuant to art. [CLS] [SEP] 6(1)(f) gdpr use
your data based on our legitimate interests

  * to provide and improve our service;

  * to perform internal quality checks;

  * to prevent, detect, process and investigate malfunctions, incidents, fraudulent or other illegal activities, or mitigate the risk of occurrence of the aforementioned events;

  * to ensure network and information security;

  * to create statistics on access channels and the use of our service;

  * to contact you, if requested by you or if necessary to fulfil the contract or permitted by law;

  * enforcing obligations owed to us, and contractual terms and conditions and;

  * accounting, risk management and record keeping

also, pursuant to art. [CLS] [SEP] 6(1)(c) gdpr we may use your data to comply with legal
obligations, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] to observe retention periods required by trade or tax law or
to comply with obligations to disclose data based on a legally binding court
decision or official order. [CLS] [SEP]

more specifically, we may use your data for the following purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **researchgate account**

the personal data you provide in connection with registering for your member
account will be used to create, maintain, and secure your account. [CLS] [SEP] by creating
a member account, you will benefit from functionalities and services that are
not available to visitors. [CLS] [SEP] any personal data you provide in addition to the
required data to register for an account, will facilitate your ability to get
into contact with other members, promote yourself and your research, and
receive more relevant recommendations from our recommendation services. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing this data is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(b) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **communications**

depending on the way you are communicating with us, we may use your name,
email address, telephone number, and the content of your previous
correspondence to respond to you and provide assistance. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(b) or (f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] as a public-facing company, we have a legitimate interest in being able to receive, process, and respond to enquiries. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **transactional emails**

provided you have not opted out from receiving transactional emails from us,
we will use your email address to send you emails about relevant developments
on the service concerning for example, your network, new features,
publications, projects, updates from the q&a section, and emails regarding
your professional career. [CLS] [SEP]

you can opt out from receiving transactional emails at any time by clicking
the "unsubscribe" link within an email or by visiting your account settings. [CLS] [SEP]

    * legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(b) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **sponsored emails**

where you have provided your prior consent to receiving sponsored emails, we
will use your email address to send you such emails. [CLS] [SEP] where legally allowed, we
will also use your email address to send you sponsored emails without your
prior consent. [CLS] [SEP]

in any case, you can opt out from receiving sponsored emails at any time by
clicking the "unsubscribe" link within an email or visiting the "notification
settings" in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(a) or (f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] whenever we rely on our legitimate interest to process your email address for sending sponsored emails, we do so as it is in our best interest to make the service as helpful and meaningful to you as possible, which may also mean that third-party content will be taken into consideration. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, these email campaigns help us in monetizing our service, so we can keep offering it to you. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **offer members tailored content**

using our recommendation technology, we process your personal data or infer
information in order to provide the service in a way that is tailored to your
interests. [CLS] [SEP] this enables us to customize the features and offerings
researchgate provides to you through the service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we provide
dynamic web pages that are individually adapted to you. [CLS] [SEP] we may present content
recommendations such as research items that are "suggested for you" and/or
recommendations regarding other individuals such as "who to follow" or
"related researchers" (other members) you can follow. [CLS] [SEP] in the same way that you
benefit from content and individuals recommended to you, you and your content
might be recommended to other members and therefore might appear in their
experience, for example in their home feed. [CLS] [SEP] we derive learnings from members’
interactions with tailored content and suggestions and subsequently take them
into account to improve any further offerings of tailored content. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(b) or (f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] we have a legitimate interest in providing the best user experience based on the individual needs. [CLS] [SEP] this processing does not conflict with your interests as it corresponds with a person’s reasonable expectations when signing up for an account. [CLS] [SEP] the processing has no negative impact for our members but is in their interests as it allows researchgate to provide them a tailored service. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **offer members tailored advertising content and relevant jobs**

as a member, we aim to offer you advertising content that is most relevant to
you. [CLS] [SEP] in this context, we use, whether separately or combined, the personal
data you provide, we collect, or we infer from your use of the service and the
internet and also contextual information of the site you are currently
visiting. [CLS] [SEP] this enables us to display advertisements that best match your
particular interests, and job suggestions that are relevant to your scientific
field, experience and research. [CLS] [SEP] for further information about advertisements
on the service, please refer to section [advertisements on
researchgate](privacy-policy#advertisements-on-researchgate) below. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] advertising is a ubiquitous part of the internet, but we believe that advertising, when done well, is a good thing. [CLS] [SEP] we aim to display the most relevant and most helpful advertisements to you. [CLS] [SEP] to be able to do this, we must take your interests, your journey, and some of your personal data into account. [CLS] [SEP] without this processing, the advertisements we would be able to disseminate would not be different from random advertisements you can see everywhere in the internet. [CLS] [SEP] we take great care in choosing the right advertising partners and limiting the personal data we process. [CLS] [SEP] the personal data that we process for this purpose will not be shared with any third party except our technical service provider (see section [third party services for analytics, measurement and ad delivery](privacy-policy#third-party-services-for-analytics-measurement-and-ad-delivery)), and will only support our purposes. [CLS] [SEP] given that we limit the data processed, do not share it with other third parties, and process your personal data to display only relevant advertisements to you, we believe that our legitimate interest to monetize our platform and therefore continue to provide you with the service outweighs. [CLS] [SEP] we believe our service is a service to researchers, research, and science as a whole. [CLS] [SEP] among other things, we make worldwide collaboration possible, and facilitate the solving of important scientific questions. [CLS] [SEP] our mission is an important one. [CLS] [SEP] but this mission must be financed. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **offer visitors tailored advertising content and jobs**

as a visitor, we also aim to offer you advertising content that is most
relevant to you. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of visitors, this means that the third parties
delivering advertisements may take into account the context of the current
site you are visiting. [CLS] [SEP] for further information about advertisements on the
service, please refer to section [advertisements on researchgate](privacy-
policy#advertisements-on-researchgate) below. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(f) gdpr and where applicable art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(a) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] because some parts of our service are available to everyone, even those who don’t have an account with us, we believe that wherever we haven’t asked you for your consent, the data processing conducted is of such limited effect on you, that our interest to monetize the platform and therefore continue to provide the service also to non- members, is legitimate. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **candidate search**

a limited amount of your profile information (including only some information
from the overview and research tabs) will be visible for recruiters with a
recruiter account on the service. [CLS] [SEP] if the information on your profile matches
the search criteria entered by a recruiter in our candidate search feature,
this limited version of your profile may show up in their search results. [CLS] [SEP]
recruiters may choose to contact you through the messaging functionality
provided within the feature. [CLS] [SEP] your inclusion in candidate search, including
being contacted by recruiters, is fully under your control. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose to
block specific recruiters, or opt out from being included in candidate search
and contacted by any recruiters by changing your privacy settings at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

    * legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(b) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **ensure the security of your personal data**

we process your personal data in order to avoid its accidental or unlawful
destruction, as well as its loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we process the number of profile pages you and others view so as to
detect and prevent data harvesting. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, we truncate the last octet of
your ip address to prevent you from being identified. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(c) and (f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] we are legally obliged to secure data from unauthorized loss and alteration and it is also in our mutual interest to ensure data security. [CLS] [SEP] as this primarily serves the purpose of protecting your data there are no overriding interests on your part. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **generate statistics**

we use your personal data to generate statistics which pertain to
reading/search behavior and achievements. [CLS] [SEP] we also generate statistics for
internal purposes in order to constantly improve the service and its features. [CLS] [SEP]
we also conduct research and development to maintain quality and improve our
service and the user experience. [CLS] [SEP]

    * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] we have a legitimate interest to assess and evaluate the traffic on our site to improve our service. [CLS] [SEP] such improvement is also in the interest of our users as it allows them to always benefit from the best service we can offer. [CLS] [SEP]

4\. [CLS] [SEP] how we use relevant publicly available data

we also process personal data relating to authors that is publicly available
and relevant for our service. [CLS] [SEP]

we may obtain a variety of information about authors from publicly available
sources, such as information regarding previous research published, the
publication itself (including personal data too) and other functions or
references of an author related to a publication. [CLS] [SEP] we may also process
information related to an author, to create a record of their body of
scientific contributions, or that might help understand professional
connections between authors and members. [CLS] [SEP] where an author's scientific work was
publicly or privately funded, we may also process this publicly available
information. [CLS] [SEP]

when we collect publicly available materials we do not have a way to ensure
that personal data in such materials has been processed in accordance with the
applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you notify us that your personal data contained
in such materials is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of
applicable data protection laws, we may delete it upon verification of your
identity. [CLS] [SEP]

the public data processed may be associated with an account when an author
chooses to become a member. [CLS] [SEP]

  * our legal basis for this processing is art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 (1)(f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] the data processed is publicly available data. [CLS] [SEP] also, the data processed has to be processed to provide a correct and complete scientific picture. [CLS] [SEP] our legitimate interest is to provide a comprehensive and accurate repository of scientific work, contributions and success. [CLS] [SEP] without processing additional public data, we could not achieve these aims. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, since we offer the possibility to connect this data with an account, we provide members a convenient way to establish an account that is as complete as possible, without the effort of manually adding the information themselves. [CLS] [SEP]

5\. [CLS] [SEP] information we process when using technologies like cookies and pixels

we and service providers acting on our behalf store log files and use tracking
technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and local shared
objects, also known as flash cookies, to collect information relating to you

  3. [CLS] [SEP]  **other technology**

in addition to cookies, this website uses so-called pixels, web beacons, clear
gifs, and other similar mechanisms (" **pixels** "). [CLS] [SEP] a pixel is an image file
or link to an image file added to the website code but not sent to your end
device. [CLS] [SEP] pixels are largely used for the same reasons as cookies, i.e. [CLS] [SEP] to
analyze the number of people who use our service or, if the user's email
program allows html, to determine whether and when an email was opened. [CLS] [SEP] pixels
help us to check and optimize the effectiveness of our service and offers as
well as advertising campaigns served on researchgate. [CLS] [SEP] pixels do not provide us
with personal data. [CLS] [SEP] pixels are usually used in conjunction with cookies. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have deactivated the use of cookies in your browser, then pixels will only
report an anonymous website visit. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use pixel-based and cookie-based conversion tracking technologies to,
for example, measure the success of advertising campaigns served on the
service. [CLS] [SEP] to this end we use technologies provided by google (see below section
[google services](privacy-policy#third-party-services-for-analytics-
measurement-and-ad-delivery)). [CLS] [SEP]

6\. [CLS] [SEP] advertisements on researchgate

we display advertisements on our service so we can continue to offer many of
our features for free. [CLS] [SEP] we generate revenue by disseminating advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] we
allow selected partners to advertise their products, content, jobs and more,
on our service. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP]  **basics**

when advertisers or ad networks place advertisements on our service, they may
collect or we may share the following types of information from within our
service:

    * performance data (such as the number of clicks on an advertisement);

    * aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other users collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (such as users who are located in berlin);

    * certain technical information (for example, ip addresses, cookieids, non-persistent device identifiers such as identifiers for advertising (idfas); and

    * other contextual data about our dissemination and your potential perception of advertisements. [CLS] [SEP]

advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of
tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons (see explanations
above), and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking
technologies at the same time. [CLS] [SEP]  
the information collected may be used to:

    * measure how effective advertisements are;

    * offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements that are more relevant to you; and/or

    * undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other user activity to improve your experience. [CLS] [SEP]

after clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site
hosted by researchgate. [CLS] [SEP] researchgate is not responsible for any third party,
or its affiliates or agents, failing to use your personal data in accordance
with such third party's privacy policy, or any contractual or other legal
obligations to which such third party, its affiliates or agents, may be
subject. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP]  **logged-in experience**

the advertising content shown to logged-in members is served by researchgate
itself using the help of third party technology providers, such as google
analytics, google tag manager and googledv 360. [CLS] [SEP] information on those service
providers can be found at section [third party services for analytics,
measurement and ad delivery](privacy-policy#third-party-services-for-
analytics-measurement-and-ad-delivery). [CLS] [SEP]

in the case of these advertisements, researchgate has a direct relationship
with the advertiser. [CLS] [SEP] we take great care when choosing such advertising
partners. [CLS] [SEP] we allow them to target you based on pre-defined segments of which
you may be a part. [CLS] [SEP] these segments are created by researchgate and may take
into consideration your profile information and/or contextual information. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, a segment might take into account your skills, disciplines, career
level, current location, or what page on the service you are currently
visiting. [CLS] [SEP] we may also infer data such as gender or age group (for example
20-35 male) to assign you to a segment. [CLS] [SEP] an example of a segment that an
advertising partner could target is: "scientist, biotechnology, eu, on a
publication page containing a publication about a virus." targeting this
segment would mean that only members who are part of this segment will see
that advertiser’s advertisement on the service. [CLS] [SEP]

by using this information and these segments, we and our advertising partners
are able to present relevant advertisements to you. [CLS] [SEP] we will take your previous
interactions with advertisements into account when determining whether to
present you with subsequent advertisements and in subsequent segmentation
efforts. [CLS] [SEP] this is another way that we try to avoid providing you with
advertisements that are not of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]

researchgate might also re-target you with advertisements of our advertising
partners on third-party platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for this re-targeting, we don’t share any
of your personal data with our advertising partners. [CLS] [SEP] rather, we provide google
dv 360 (see [below](privacy-policy#third-party-services-for-analytics-
measurement-and-ad-delivery)) with an anonymized (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] hashed) value of your
researchgate cookie id. [CLS] [SEP] google dv 360 might have the same hash value already
in its systems, received from a third-party platform. [CLS] [SEP] whenever this is the
case, we could present you with an advertisement from one of our advertising
partners on a third-party platform. [CLS] [SEP]

you can opt out from receiving cookie-based tailored advertisements on the
service and retargeting at any time, by clicking here. [CLS] [SEP] note that this opt out
will place a cookie on your device so we can remember your choice, which means
if you delete your cookies at any point in time, you would have to opt out
again. [CLS] [SEP]

please also note that opting out from researchgate cookie-based tailored
advertising will not have the effect of disabling advertisements completely. [CLS] [SEP]
for the delivery of advertisements, we will still take into account the
context of the page you are currently visiting and personalize advertisements
based on information other than cookie-based information. [CLS] [SEP]

information about the respective cookies we are using for researchgate served
advertisements can be found in the cookie table above. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP]  **logged-out experience**

a great amount of information, particularly publication pages and the q&a
section of our service, are available also for visitors. [CLS] [SEP] these parts of our
service are also free for everyone. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, logged-out visitors will find
advertisements there. [CLS] [SEP]

primarily, researchgate enables third-party networks and platforms with which
we have a business relationship to disseminate advertisements on the service. [CLS] [SEP]

for each of those third parties, their technology, data processing and
purposes, we may ask you for your explicit consent. [CLS] [SEP] we do so with the help of
our consent modal. [CLS] [SEP] here’s how to navigate it:

    * under "more options", you will find a list of data processing purpose-stacks. [CLS] [SEP] by clicking on these, you can find out what each stack specifically consists of, according legal descriptions and a corresponding list of partners that process data under this purpose stack. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose to allow the stack or just parts of the stack. [CLS] [SEP] if you prefer to not allow a stack or specific purposes, you don't have to do anything. [CLS] [SEP]

    * clicking "agree" has the effect of explaining consent for all data processing and according partners. [CLS] [SEP]

    * any settings you made will be stored when you click "save and exit". [CLS] [SEP]

    * if you don't want to explain any consent, you just have to click "save & exit", since data processing that requires prior consent is default “off”. [CLS] [SEP]

    * "additional links" will refer you to this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

    * under "more options" – "partners" you will find a list of partners, their purposes and respective descriptions, as well as links pointing to the respective partners privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] here you can make specific choices regarding each partner. [CLS] [SEP] some personal data is processed without your prior consent, but you have the right to object. [CLS] [SEP]

    * under "more options" – "legitimate interest" you will find a list of "legitimate interest purposes" and "legitimate interest vendors". [CLS] [SEP] when you unfold the legitimate interest purposes, the legal description and the partner relying on legitimate interest for this purpose is provided. [CLS] [SEP] when you unfold the description of a specific partner, you can also find out for which purposes, the specific partner relies on legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP] where processing of personal data is being executed without your prior approval but with the legal basis "legitimate interest", you have the right to object. [CLS] [SEP] under "more options" – "legitimate interest", you can explain your objection for each purpose and each partner, but you can also click "object all". [CLS] [SEP]

    * most important for you: unless you granted consent by clicking "agree" in our consent modal, our partners will only be able to process very limited personal data and only if they can claim legitimate interest to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

    * at any time, you can withdraw any consent given or modify your consent. [CLS] [SEP] you can do so by re-prompting the consent modal by clicking here. [CLS] [SEP]

    * please note: even if you have not provided your consent, you will still be presented with advertisements, but such advertisements will not be tailored to you. [CLS] [SEP]

7\. [CLS] [SEP] third party services for analytics, measurement and ad delivery

  1. [CLS] [SEP]  **google services**

google analytics: we use google analytics to evaluate the usage behavior on
our service. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics is a web analysis service provided by google
ireland ltd, gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland. [CLS] [SEP] for this web
analysis service, google uses cookies on our website to systematically
evaluate the interactions of users on our service. [CLS] [SEP] the information generated
by the cookie about the use of our service by the user (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] truncated ip
address, website currently visited, referrer, duration of stay, and frequency
of the call of the website) is transferred to a google server in ireland. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, a transfer of the data to another google server in the usa is
possible. [CLS] [SEP] google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your
use of the service, compiling reports on website activity for us, and
providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. [CLS] [SEP] the
processed data can be used to create pseudonymous user profiles of users. [CLS] [SEP] the
data is deleted after 26 months. [CLS] [SEP] by activating ip anonymization on our
website, your ip address is truncated before it is forwarded within the member
states of the european union or other states party to the agreement on the
european economic area. [CLS] [SEP] only in exceptional cases will your full ip address be
forwarded to a google server in ireland and possibly the usa and shortened
there. [CLS] [SEP] google will not combine your ip address collected via google analytics
with other data that google holds. [CLS] [SEP]

to opt out from google analytics, please click here. [CLS] [SEP] if you delete your
cookies, you have to click this link again. [CLS] [SEP]  
our use of google analytics is also administered by the consent modal as
described at [advertisements on researchgate](privacy-policy#advertisements-
on-researchgate). [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, each of the following services is provided by google ireland ltd,
gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland. [CLS] [SEP]

you can opt out from the following google services using [this
link](https://adssettings.google.com/):

    * google tag manager is a solution that allows us to manage website tags through one interface. [CLS] [SEP] the tag manager itself is a cookie-less domain and does not collect personal data. [CLS] [SEP] the tool triggers other tags that may collect personal data. [CLS] [SEP] google tag manager does not access this data. [CLS] [SEP]

    * we use google dv 360, including the tool "display & video" to be able to recognize you on third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] for this purpose, the google display & video 360 will place cookies on your device which will enable recognition of you in the google advertising network. [CLS] [SEP] we are subsequently able to present you advertisements on the basis of your surfing behavior on third-party platforms. [CLS] [SEP] this service also enables us to evaluate delivered advertisements and optimize them. [CLS] [SEP]

    * google ad manager enables the control and optimization of advertisements on our service. [CLS] [SEP] it also helps to create campaign performance reports and prevents advertisements being displayed to you multiple times. [CLS] [SEP] google ad manager also uses cookies for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a californian resident, please click here to limit google’s ability
to use your personal data for the serving of personalized ads. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP]  **cloudflare**

we also use the services of cloudflare, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (101 townsend st., san francisco,
ca 94107, usa). [CLS] [SEP] cloudflare helps us to provide our service to our users in the
fastest way by "copying" our service and putting it on servers that are
geographically as close as possible to your current location. [CLS] [SEP] cloudflare
distributes the server load to those servers that make the most sense for your
request. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, cloudflare blocks threats and abusive bots and crawlers
that have a negative impact on our bandwidth and server resources. [CLS] [SEP] cloudflare
also provides an "i am under attack"\- mode that requests users to solve a
task before they can visit the site. [CLS] [SEP] through cloudflare, our service is more
powerful and less vulnerable. [CLS] [SEP] for these purposes cloudflare uses cookies (see
**cookie table for researchgate** ) and processes data of which your ip
address could be considered personal. [CLS] [SEP] cloudflare might store this data in the
us. [CLS] [SEP] more information about cloudflare can be found
[here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). [CLS] [SEP]

8\. [CLS] [SEP] recipients and safeguards

  1. [CLS] [SEP]  **recipients**

researchgate does not sell any of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

the personal data that researchgate collects from you and that you provide to
researchgate is processed in canada and stored on servers in canada. [CLS] [SEP] canada is
one of the few countries for which the eu has adopted an adequacy decision in
which it decided that canada ensures an adequate level of protection according
to eu standards. [CLS] [SEP] you can review the commission decision [here](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a32002d0002). [CLS] [SEP]

some of your personal data is accessible to other users of our platform who
may, for example, visit your publication pages or profile. [CLS] [SEP]

your personal data may also be transferred to third parties as described in
this privacy policy and where applicable to those third parties listed in our
consent modal. [CLS] [SEP] these parties might be advertisers or companies that help us
disseminate advertisements, measure the performance of our advertisements
and/or analyze your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP] these third parties will not receive
data that directly personally identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] the data shared is limited to
identifiers such as ip addresses and cookie ids. [CLS] [SEP] your name, email address, and
other directly identifying data will only be shared with third parties if you
explicitly allow us to share this data. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also disclose personal data in response to legal process or when the
law requires it (for example, in response to a court order) or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, to protect the rights, property, or safety of
researchgate, the service, users of the service (including you), and others. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use third party service providers, in particular for technical and
business services, tax advisors and legal counsel. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers
receive personal data solely for the performance of their services for us on
our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] they are contractually obliged not to use personal data for other
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP]  **safeguards**

some of the third parties with whom your personal data will be shared are
located outside of the european economic area, in countries whose data
protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us. [CLS] [SEP]

if we transfer your personal data to countries outside of the european
economic area or which do not offer adequate and similar protection, we will
ensure that we do this in accordance with applicable data protection
regulations (for example, by putting in place an appropriate data transfer
instrument such as the european standard contractual clauses). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we will do this with a view to ensuring that the level of protection applied
to the processing of your personal data in these countries is similar to that
applied within the european economic area. [CLS] [SEP]

9\. [CLS] [SEP] closing your account and retention of personal data

for members, we generally store their personal data as long as their account
is active. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have created an account, you can close it yourself in your ‘account
settings’. [CLS] [SEP] if you request that we close your account for you, we might ask for
proof of identity before doing so. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also close inactive accounts or accounts that are used in violation of
our [terms of service](terms-of-service) or any applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

immediately after closing an account, it will not be accessible/visible
anymore. [CLS] [SEP] please note that closing an account is irreversible. [CLS] [SEP]

for members, we will retain personal data from closed or inactive accounts to
the extent and as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations
and/or to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve
disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our
[terms of service](terms-of-service), and/or take other actions otherwise
permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

in general, personal data from closed or inactive accounts will be deleted or
anonymized from our system backups one year after the account is closed or
deactivated. [CLS] [SEP]

we only keep personal data for the time strictly necessary in order to enable
the use of our service and/or to fulfil the purposes identified above, and/or
to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations. [CLS] [SEP] in all other cases, we
delete your personal data with the exception of such data that we are required
to retain for the purpose of contractual or statutory (e.g., taxation or
commercial law) retention periods. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, we keep payment and invoice
related information or support inquiries to the extent required by trade and
tax law for the statutory retention periods (ten, respectively six years). [CLS] [SEP]

10\. [CLS] [SEP] automated decision-making

we do not engage in automated individual decision-making, including profiling
(according to art. [CLS] [SEP] 22 (1) and (4) gdpr). [CLS] [SEP]

11\. [CLS] [SEP] data subject rights

in addition to your rights to withdraw any consent you may have granted or

[CLS] [SEP] 18 gdpr in the event that: you contest the accuracy of the data; the processing is unlawful but you oppose its deletion; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you need it for your assertion; it may be relevant to the exercise or defense of legal claims; or you have lodged an objection to the processing in accordance with art. [CLS] [SEP] 21 gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

  * right to data portability in accordance with art. [CLS] [SEP] 20 gdpr, to receive the stored personal data concerning you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or request the transfer of this data to another responsible party. [CLS] [SEP]
