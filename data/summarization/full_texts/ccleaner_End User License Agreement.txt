_agreement__ ”) carefully before you use the solution (as defined below). [CLS] [SEP] this
is a legally binding contract. [CLS] [SEP] by assenting electronically, or installing the
solution or using the solution, you accept all the terms and conditions of
this agreement on behalf of yourself and any entity or individual you
represent or for whose device you acquire the solution (collectively “ _
_you__ ”). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this
agreement, do not continue the installation process, do not use the solution
and delete or destroy all copies of the solution in your possession or
control.**

this agreement relates to your use of certain software ("software"), services
or hardware and related firmware, including any updates (each, a “ _
_solution__ ”) in connection with which you are accepting this agreement, and
any related documentation. [CLS] [SEP] in this agreement, “ _ _vendor__ ” means the entity

you; “ _ _documentation__ ” means any user manuals and instructions provided
with the solution; and “ _ _applicable conditions__ ” means collectively the
subscription period together with the types of devices, permitted number of

you acquired the solution (including any terms and conditions of sale), and
any distribution agreement, reseller agreement, partner agreement or other
agreement between you and vendor or other member of vendor group, as well as
the other limitations described by section 2 and the documentation. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that this agreement comes in two parts. [CLS] [SEP] sections _1_ through _12_
of this agreement apply to all solutions, including those listed below. [CLS] [SEP]
section _13_ sets out additional terms and conditions affecting specific
solutions or categories of solutions, including third party software, services
and other products (section _13.1_ ); managed service provider licenses
(section _13.2_ ); browser cleanup (section _13.3_ ); wifi finder (section

agreement you previously entered into with respect to a prior version of the
solution. [CLS] [SEP]

vendor may amend this agreement at any time by notice provided to you in
accordance with this agreement, and your continued use of any affected
solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute
your acceptance of the amendment of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] vendor may require that
you accept the amended agreement in order to continue using any affected
solution you have previously acquired. [CLS] [SEP] if you decline to accept the amended
agreement, vendor may terminate your use of such affected solution, in which
case you may obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have
paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the subscription period by
following the instructions found [here.](http://www.avast.com/refund-policy)

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] license

vendor grants to you a non-exclusive license to use the solution and the

_subscription period__ ”), provided that you agree to the terms and conditions
of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] permitted use of the solution

2.1. [CLS] [SEP] you may use the solution on, or to support, up to the agreed number (the

”), personal computers, iot and other internet-connected devices, or other
device compatible with the solution (each, including each mobile device, a “ _
_device__ ”) indicated in the applicable conditions exclusively:

2.1.1. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of solutions that vendor designates for corporate,
commercial or business use (each, a “ _ _business solution__ ”), by you or
your affiliates (those entities controlling you, controlled by you or under
common control with you) for internal business purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any
such use of the business solution by your affiliate, you are responsible for
your affiliate’s compliance with this agreement, and a breach by your
affiliate will be deemed a breach by you. [CLS] [SEP] any obligations of vendor under this
agreement will be owed solely to you and not your affiliates that use the
business solution under the terms and conditions of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

2.1.2. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of all other solutions, including avast free antivirus, avg
free antivirus, ccleaner free and all other solutions for which you are not
required to pay a subscription fee or other price either to obtain the
solution or to continue using the solution after a trial period (each, a “ _
_consumer solution__ ”), by a natural person or members of his household for
personal, noncommercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for the avoidance of doubt, no consumer
solution is provided or licensed for use by any: (i) natural person for
commercial purposes; or (ii) business, company, government entity, non-

number of different devices on which the solution is used does not exceed the
permitted number of devices; or

2.3.3. [CLS] [SEP] if the applicable conditions grant you the right to use the solution in
providing msp services, use of the solution as described in section _13.2_. [CLS] [SEP]

2.4. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the solution other than as expressly authorized by section
_2_ of this agreement, or any resale or further distribution of the solution,
constitutes a material breach of this agreement and may violate applicable
copyright laws. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] updates

vendor, from time to time during the subscription period and without your
separate permission or consent, may from time to time deploy an upgrade or
update of, or replacement for, any solution (“ _ _update__ ”), and as a result
of any such deployment you may not be able to use the applicable solution or
device (or certain functions of the device) until any such update is fully
installed or activated. [CLS] [SEP] each update will be deemed to form a part of the
“solution” for all purposes under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] updates may include both
additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered
by a solution or may replace it entirely, and vendor will determine the
content, features and functionality of the updated solution in its sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] vendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay
updates, but in any event you may need to download and permit installation or
activation of all available updates to obtain maximum benefit from the
solution. [CLS] [SEP] vendor may stop providing support for a solution until you have
accepted and installed or activated all updates. [CLS] [SEP] vendor in its sole discretion
will determine when and if updates are appropriate and has no obligation to
make any updates available to you. [CLS] [SEP] vendor in its sole discretion may stop
providing updates for any version of the solution other than the most current
version, or updates supporting use of the solution in connection with any
versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other
software with which the solution is designed to operate. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] ownership rights

4.1. [CLS] [SEP] the solutions and documentation are the intellectual property of vendor
and are protected by applicable copyright laws, international treaty
provisions and other applicable laws of the country in which the solution is
being used. [CLS] [SEP] the structure, organization and computer code of any software and
firmware are valuable trade secrets and confidential information of vendor. [CLS] [SEP] to
the extent you provide any comments or suggestions about the solution to
vendor, you grant vendor the right and license to retain and use any such
comments or suggestions for any purpose in its current or future products or
services, without further compensation to you and without your approval of
such retention or use. [CLS] [SEP]

4.2. [CLS] [SEP] except as stated in this agreement, your possession, use of a solution
does not grant you any rights or title to any intellectual property rights in
the solution or documentation. [CLS] [SEP] all rights to the solution and documentation,

govern. [CLS] [SEP]

5.2. [CLS] [SEP] certain solutions may grant you or another user administrative privileges
that, among other things, may allow the administrator to monitor other devices
and/or the status of solutions deployed on other devices, including for

represent and warrant that you will exercise such administrative privileges
only with respect to devices and solutions for which you are duly authorized
and for no other purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you also represent and warrant to vendor that: (i)
you have all the requisite authority to accept this agreement, and install
and/or use the solution on the devices, on behalf of any owners and users of

others, content you have generated or obtained from other sources (“ _ _user
content__ ”). [CLS] [SEP] you retain any and all intellectual property rights you already
hold under applicable law in user content you publish or share through the
solution, subject to the rights, licenses, and other terms of this agreement,
including any underlying rights of others in any user content that you may use
or modify. [CLS] [SEP] you grant to each member of the vendor group, a non-exclusive,
unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and
royalty-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce,
disclose, sell, resell, sublicense (through multiple levels), modify, adapt,
display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make
derivative works of, and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or
any portion of the user content you publish or share through a solution (and
derivative works thereof), solely for the purpose of providing the solutions
to you under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] each time you publish or share any user content,
you represent and warrant to each member of the vendor group that you are at
least the age of majority in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside and
are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent
or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any user
content you publish or share, and that, in regard to that user content: (i)
you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other
rights to the user content, or you have a lawful right to publish and share
the user content and grant each member of the vendor group the right to use it
as described in this section _5.3_ , all without any obligation being imposed
on any member of the vendor group to obtain the consent of any third party and
without creating any obligation or liability whatsoever for any member of
vendor group; (ii) the user content is accurate; (iii) the user content does
not and, as to each member of the vendor group’s permitted uses and
exploitation set forth in this agreement, will not infringe any intellectual
property or other right of any third party; and (iv) the user content will not
violate this agreement or cause injury or harm to any person. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] limited warranty; disclaimer and exclusion of liability

6.1. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the remainder of this section 6, vendor warrants to you that
the solution will perform, or will be performed, substantially in accordance
with the documentation for a period of 30 days following your initial
acquisition of the solution. [CLS] [SEP] to make a warranty claim, you must follow the
instructions provided by the source from which you acquired the solution. [CLS] [SEP] if
the solution does not perform substantially in accordance with the
documentation, the entire and exclusive liability of each member of the vendor
group and each vendor partner, and your sole and exclusive remedy, in respect
of such warranty will be limited to, at vendor’s option, to either: (i)
replacement of the solution; or (ii) return of the solution to obtain a refund
for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or
unused portion of the subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] this warranty applies only to the
solution as originally delivered, and does not apply to: (i) any updates; (ii)
any defects caused by the combination, operation or use of the solution with:
(a) software, hardware or other materials not provided by vendor; or (b)
devices, software, or other materials that do not conform to vendor
requirements set forth in the documentation. [CLS] [SEP]

6.2. [CLS] [SEP] except as stated in section _6.1_ of this agreement, members of the
vendor group and vendor partners do not warrant the performance or results you
may obtain by using any solution or documentation. [CLS] [SEP] except as stated in section
_6.1_ of this agreement, the solution is provided “as is” and members of the
vendor group and vendor partners make no express or implied warranties or
conditions and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, disclaim any and all
warranties and conditions implied by statute, common law, jurisprudence or
other theories of law, including implied warranties or conditions of
noninfringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, suitable
quality or fitness for any particular purpose. [CLS] [SEP] vendor does not warrant that
the operation of any solution will be uninterrupted or error free, that any
solution will work properly on any given device or with any particular
configuration of hardware and/or software, or that any solution will provide
complete protection for the integrity of selected data, information or content
stored or transmitted via the internet. [CLS] [SEP]

6.3. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, any solution
provided to you without fees (including any solution provided as a “free,”
“trial” or “beta” solution) is provided on an “as is”, “with all faults,” and
“as available” basis, without any warranty of any kind and without support or
other services by vendor. [CLS] [SEP]

6.4. [CLS] [SEP] to the full extent permitted by law, in no event will vendor or any
company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with vendor
(collectively, the “ _ _vendor group__ ”) or their respective agents,
licensors, representatives, suppliers, distributors, resellers, wireless
carriers over whose network or systems any solution is provided, or any other
business partner of any member of the vendor group (collectively, the “ _
_vendor partners__ ”) be liable to you or any third party for:

6.4.1. [CLS] [SEP] any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, special or exemplary
damages or losses whatsoever, without regard to cause or theory of liability;

6.4.2 any damages for any loss of business, profits or revenue, loss of
privacy, loss of use of any device or solution (including the solution),
wasted expenditure, costs of procuring substitute or replacement goods,
services or digital products, business interruption, any unauthorized
disclosure or loss (including any corruption, degradation or unavailability)
of any data or information of any nature (whether or not any of the foregoing
losses, damages, costs or expenditure are direct or indirect losses or
damages); or

6.4.3 any other pecuniary or nonpecuniary loss or damage arising out of this
agreement or any solution provided hereunder;

even if such member of the vendor group or vendor partner has been advised of
the possibility of any such loss or damage. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this agreement or otherwise, no member of the vendor group or any
vendor partner will be liable to you or any third party for any loss or damage
(whether direct or indirect) for any unauthorized access to, or any
corruption, degradation, unavailability, erasure, theft, destruction,
alteration, disclosure or loss of any data, information or content
transmitted, received or stored by or in connection with any solution
regardless of the cause. [CLS] [SEP] to the full extent permitted by law, in no
circumstances will any member of vendor group or any vendor partner’s total
aggregate liability for all loss or damage to you or any third party arising
from or relating to any solution, the subscription or this agreement exceed
the greater of: (i) five u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars (us$5.00); and (ii) the amount of the
subscription fees you have paid for the immediately preceding 12 months of the
subscription period. [CLS] [SEP]

6.5. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusions and limitations of liability of members of the vendor
group and vendor partners contained in this agreement will not limit or
exclude their potential liability for:

6.5.1 death, personal injury, damage to tangible property or fraud beyond the
extent permitted by applicable laws; and

6.5.2 any matter that may not otherwise be limited or excluded by applicable
laws. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] privacy; processing of personal and other information

7.1. [CLS] [SEP] the term “ _ _data,__ ” as used in this agreement and the privacy policy,
means: (a) the information you provide to vendor, another member of the vendor
group, or a vendor partner in the course of ordering solutions, including your
name, billing address (including postal code), email address, phone number,
payment card or account number, payment card or account verification code,
payment card commencement date and expiration date, the account password you
select for your account with vendor or another member of the vendor group, and
other billing data as defined in vendor’s privacy policy (the “ _ _privacy
policy__ ”, which you can find [here](http://www.avast.com/vendor))
(collectively, “ _ _transaction data__ ”); (b) information vendor, another
member of the vendor group or a vendor partner collects in the course of
processing and fulfilling your orders for solutions, including information
about the make, model, operating system and other identifying details of your
device, the name of your internet service provider, your internet protocol
(ip) address; and (c) information about your installation and use of solutions
((b) and (c) collectively being referred to as “ _ _service data__ ” in the
privacy policy

7.2. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize vendor, another member of the vendor group or a vendor
partner, to use your data, for the purposes described in the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge that such use of your data includes processing and fulfilling
your orders for subscriptions, improving solutions, and providing information
to you about the solutions to which you have subscribed and offering you other
solutions. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that vendor or another member of the vendor group
may share your data with vendor partners such as vendor’s ecommerce platform
providers and payment processors, suppliers providing support, services and
solutions to you on vendor’s behalf, and suppliers providing vendor or a
member of the vendor group with purchase analytics and crash analytics in
respect of solutions. [CLS] [SEP] you also acknowledge that vendor or a member of the
vendor group may share data that is anonymized and aggregated with third
parties for trend analytics. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] termination

8.1. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement will immediately terminate upon your breach of any of your
obligations in this agreement (including any breach of your obligations in
sections _2_ , _5_ or _10_ ), which will result in forfeiture of any rights
you may have to receive updates or to obtain a refund for the portion of the
subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the
subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] vendor reserves the right to any other remedies available
under law in the event your breach of any of your obligations under this
agreement adversely affects any member of the vendor group or any vendor

computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 12.212. [CLS] [SEP]
consistent with 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 12.212 and 48 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4,
all u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government end users acquire such solutions and related documentation
with only those rights set forth in this agreement that apply to non-
governmental customers. [CLS] [SEP] use of such solutions and related documentation
constitutes agreement by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government entity that the computer software

of the rights and restrictions set forth in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] export controls

you are not a member of any of the denied persons list, unverified list,
entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or any other
lists published by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government; and (ii) you will not use, export or

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver

11.1. [CLS] [SEP] this section _11_ applies to any dispute arising from or related to any
solution, subscription for any solution or this agreement, and involving you
and vendor. [CLS] [SEP] “dispute,” for the purposes of this section 11, means any dispute,
action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s)
asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or
legal basis, claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation or fraud,
indemnification, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), and
violation of statute or regulation). [CLS] [SEP]

11.2. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a dispute, you must provide vendor with a notice of
dispute, which is a written statement of your name, address and contact
information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested by
you. [CLS] [SEP] you must send any notice of dispute by email to vendor at
[legal@avast.com](mailto:legal@avast.com) (stating subject: section _11_
notice of dispute under eula). [CLS] [SEP]

11.3. [CLS] [SEP] any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be
conducted solely on an individual basis. [CLS] [SEP] you will not seek to have any dispute
heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other
proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative
capacity. [CLS] [SEP] no arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without
the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or
proceedings. [CLS] [SEP]

11.4. [CLS] [SEP] if you and vendor do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation,
any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by
binding arbitration governed by the united states federal arbitration act (“ _
_faa__ ”), 9 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the state of new
york (without regard to choice of laws principles). [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in
section _11.5_ below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate
in litigation as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge
or jury. [CLS] [SEP] instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator,
whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review
under the faa. [CLS] [SEP] any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the
arbitrator’s award. [CLS] [SEP]

11.5. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration requirement of this section _11_ is subject to the
following exceptions:

11.5.1. [CLS] [SEP] you may litigate any dispute in small claims court, in the county or
other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the dispute meets
all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. [CLS] [SEP] if you initiate a
claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees. [CLS] [SEP]

11.5.2. [CLS] [SEP] all disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or
vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a consumer and live in the european union, norway, iceland or
lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your dispute through an internet
platform for online dispute resolution established by the european commission
(the “ _ _odr platform__ ”). [CLS] [SEP] the odr platform is intended to facilitate out-
of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services
between consumers and traders based in the european union, norway, iceland and
lichtenstein. [CLS] [SEP] you will find the odr platform by following this link:
<http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr>. [CLS] [SEP]

11.6. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration
association (the “ _ _aaa__ ”) in accordance with the aaa’s “consumer
arbitration rules” effective september 1, 2014, including the “costs of
arbitration (including aaa administrative fees)” effective september 1, 2014
(collectively, the “ _ _consumer procedures__ ”) and will be subject to the
following:

11.6.1. [CLS] [SEP] the consumer procedures provide for certain fees, specifically
allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (vendor). [CLS] [SEP] if
your claim is us$75,000 or less, vendor will pay all of those specified fees
and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. [CLS] [SEP] vendor does not agree to
bear any other costs. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim is more than us$75,000, the consumer
procedures will govern payment. [CLS] [SEP]

11.6.2. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in below, the aaa’s consumer procedures will be
applied to any dispute between the parties. [CLS] [SEP] however, pursuant to consumer
arbitration rule r-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the
consumer arbitration rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. [CLS] [SEP] this
agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the consumer procedures. [CLS] [SEP] you
will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political
subdivision in which you reside. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration proceedings will be conducted
by conference call. [CLS] [SEP] however, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the
aaa consumer procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary
authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party. [CLS] [SEP]

11.6.3. [CLS] [SEP] you and the vendor agree that the use of the aaa to administer
arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate disputes. [CLS] [SEP]
if the aaa will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and vendor will
negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the
dispute as provided in the consumer procedures. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties cannot agree on
an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator,
who will follow the aaa’s consumer procedures. [CLS] [SEP]

11.6.4. [CLS] [SEP] if one or more parts of this section _11_ > are found to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then, and only
in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the dispute will be
resolved subject to all remaining parts of this section _11_ and all other
provisions of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if such severance results in all or some parts
of a dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such
court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of new york, new
york, u.s. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will
not challenge, the new york, new york courts’ personal jurisdiction over you,
and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non
conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

11.7. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this section 11, if you
acquired a solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration
proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in
accordance with the aaa’s commercial arbitration rules (the “ _ _commercial
procedures__ ”). [CLS] [SEP] the commercial procedures are appropriately applied to any
dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] however, this agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with
the commercial procedures. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] general

electronic mail, pop-up window, dialog box or other means, even though in some

diminish any rights you may have under existing consumer protection
legislation or other applicable laws in your jurisdiction that may not be
waived by contract. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement, the applicable conditions and the

translated versions of this agreement for your convenience, the english
language version of this agreement will be the governing version of this
agreement in the case of any conflict or discrepancy. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, in any judicial
proceeding or otherwise, the terms of this agreement will be construed as
having been drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of
proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship
of any provisions of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

12.6. [CLS] [SEP] _severability_. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable laws, it shall to that
extent be deemed not to form part of this agreement but the remainder of this
agreement will remain valid and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted
by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

this agreement on the part of either party shall be effective for any purpose
whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and signed by such party. [CLS] [SEP] the
waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this agreement by the

agreement without the prior written consent of vendor. [CLS] [SEP] vendor may assign this

by the security solution. [CLS] [SEP]

13.8.2. [CLS] [SEP] if you request vendor’s assistance under the assurance plan, and if
you and your device qualify for assistance under section _13.8.3_ , vendor
will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you to remove the viruses
or other malicious code affecting your device. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby acknowledge, accept
and agree that vendor’s efforts may not be enough to remove certain viruses or
other malicious code from your device, and that vendor, in the course of
providing service, may alter, delete or corrupt data on your device, change
device settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your
device. [CLS] [SEP]

13.8.3. [CLS] [SEP] the assurance plan covers: (i) only the device for which you purchased
the related security solution, and may not be transferred to another device;
and (ii) only viruses and other malicious code infecting the device during the
subscription period, after you downloaded and installed the security solution
on the device, and while the security solution was running with up-to-date
malicious code definitions. [CLS] [SEP] vendor may terminate the assurance plan without
notice if it determines in its sole business judgment that you have requested
or received service under the assurance plan for a device not covered by the

software__ ”) allowing the associate to gain remote access to your device,
gather information about the device and its operations, diagnose and repair
the problem, and change device settings. [CLS] [SEP] you may also need to follow other
instructions given by the vendor or an associate. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) if you or an associate installs assistance software on a device, that
assistance software:

(i) may require that you activate it on your device. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not complete
the activation process within the period of time requested by the associate or

transactions flowing through avast secure web gateway per calendar day, by
2,000. [CLS] [SEP]

13.12.6. [CLS] [SEP] although vendor may not charge you separately for bandwidth in
connection with your use of the avast secure gateway, vendor and the relevant
vendor partner incur significant bandwidth costs in providing of the avast
secure gateway to you. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, a material increase in your bandwidth
consumption in connection with your use of the avast secure gateway will
significantly affect and disrupt the business operations of vendor and the
vendor partner. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances where your
bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the avast secure gateway
materially exceeds the number of dns transactions, or dns transactions per
seat, specified by the applicable conditions, vendor or the vendor partner may
notify you, in which case you must negotiate in good faith with vendor: (i) on
a bandwidth reduction plan; and/or (ii) to increase the pricing for of the
