# privacy policy

![](/images/daten.png)

posteo stands for maximum data protection, data economy and privacy by design. [CLS] [SEP]
we show how an internet provider can consistently be run without collecting
data, tracking or financing through advertising. [CLS] [SEP] as a matter of principle, we
do not collect inventory data from you including names or addresses. [CLS] [SEP] our
website and webmailer are ad-free and tracking-free. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we refrain
from incorporating social media plug-ins and from using google products. [CLS] [SEP]

in this privacy policy, we provide you with an overview of posteo's protection
and security of data. [CLS] [SEP]

## legal basis

the rendering of our email services requires the processing of data and occurs
according to legal provisions. [CLS] [SEP] the following government regulations are of
particular relevance to privacy - the european general data protection
regulation (gdpr), the german federal data protection act (bdsg), the german
telemedia act (tmg) as well as the secrecy of telecommunications . [CLS] [SEP] the
services provided by posteo are exclusively hosted on our servers in germany. [CLS] [SEP]

## responsible parties:

this privacy information applies to the processing of data by:

posteo e.k. [CLS] [SEP]  
methfesselstrasse 38  
10965 berlin  
germany  
email: support@posteo.de  

## data protection officer:

niels herrmann  
email: datenschutz@posteo.de  

the data protection officer at posteo e.k. [CLS] [SEP] is also reachable at the postal
address listed above. [CLS] [SEP] (addition to the posteo e.k. [CLS] [SEP] postal address: "data
protection officer niels herrmann"). [CLS] [SEP]

in november 2016, the german federal commissioner for data protection (bfdi)
conducted an inspection of privacy without cause at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] no complaints were
made and the federal privacy commissioner explicitly praised our privacy
security concept. [CLS] [SEP] the complete report can be found
[here](https://posteo.de/bfdi_pruefbericht.pdf). [CLS] [SEP]

## no inventory data

as a matter of principle, we do not collect and save any inventory data (such
as names, addresses, etc.) from you. [CLS] [SEP] when registering, you do not enter any
inventory data and we do not collect any other personally related data. [CLS] [SEP]

we effectively prevent data theft with this concept of data economy. [CLS] [SEP] the only
data sets that cannot be stolen with 100 percent certainty are those that do
not exist within a company. [CLS] [SEP] futhermore, [payment
data](https://posteo.de/en/site/payment) is not connected to your account at
posteo. [CLS] [SEP] because of this, in total, no inventory data exists for your account
at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] in other words, posteo does not keep records with customer data or
personally related data to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

in 2017, this was confirmed independently within an [audit
report](https://posteo.de/bfdi_pruefbericht.pdf) by the german federal
commissioner for data protection after an on-site inspection. [CLS] [SEP]

## traffic data: no ip addresses

traffic data consists of all data, that is accumulated through the use of
posteo. [CLS] [SEP]  
in conformity with the law, we strictly do not collect and save any ip
addresses that could be traced back to customers.. [CLS] [SEP] this was independently
confirmed in an audit report by the german federal commissioner for data
protection. [CLS] [SEP] we also do not collect your ip address if you visit our website or
if you use our contact form or webmailer. [CLS] [SEP] we also do not collect or save your
ip address if you use an external client to retrieve your emails via imap or
pop3 or to transmit messages via smtp to be delivered by us. [CLS] [SEP] in the
communication between email servers via smtp, we come to know the ip addresses
of other email servers (for example ip addresses from gmx and gmail servers). [CLS] [SEP]
the ip addresses of provider servers are only logged in the logfiles when
errors occur and deleted after 7 days. [CLS] [SEP]

we exclusively record errors that occur when sending and receiving emails to
quickly identify and correct technical disruptions and errors. [CLS] [SEP] we delete this
data, which cannot be traced back to an individual, automatically after 7
days. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we create generic, anonymised system usage and capacity
statistics. [CLS] [SEP] these statistics also do not contain any personal information or
ip addresses. [CLS] [SEP]

## content data

content data as a term is not legally defined. [CLS] [SEP] we refer to it in this context
as the saved contents in an email account. [CLS] [SEP]  
the contents of a communication and its accompanying circumstances (emails and
their metadata) are subject to telecommunications secrecy and are protected by
fundamental rights. [CLS] [SEP] that means that no one is allowed to read your emails and
we're not allowed to pass them on to third parties. [CLS] [SEP] this would be a violation
of your fundamental rights and punishable by law. [CLS] [SEP] telecommunications secrecy
can be restricted only in individual cases and only by way of a judge if there
is suspicion of certain criminal offenses. [CLS] [SEP] we always technically protect your
content data with the latest security technologies (see our [information page
about encryption](https://posteo.de/en/site/encryption)). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, content
data is consistently saved on encrypted hard drives to protect them from
physical access. [CLS] [SEP] we operate and maintain our own server infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] all of
our servers and stored data are located in germany. [CLS] [SEP] we save all content data
daily in a security backup and keep this data for a duration of 7 days. [CLS] [SEP] as a
security precaution, please create an additional copy of your content data on
a regular basis just in case you accidentally delete this data. [CLS] [SEP] additionally,
we offer the possibility to encrypt all emails, notes, contacts and calendar
entries that are saved at posteo individually with the password of the account
(aes-encryption). [CLS] [SEP] you can do this in the settings of your mailbox at the touch
of a button. [CLS] [SEP] users of end-to-end encryption can add an additional level of
encryption by applying inbound encryption to all incoming emails. [CLS] [SEP]

when you delete content data, it's deleted immediately. [CLS] [SEP] if the data has been
backed up in one of our daily security backups, it will remain there for an
additional 7 days until it is completely deleted. [CLS] [SEP]  
in general, posteo does not delete content data from an account as long as the
contractual relationship is standing and has not been terminated by you or
through posteo in accordance with our terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP]

automatic spam and virus detection occurs at posteo without any personal
information and without the creation of profiles. [CLS] [SEP] we implement our own spam
detection. [CLS] [SEP] we also use blacklists from third parties for this purpose but only
locally on our own servers. [CLS] [SEP] the content of our users is not analysed by third
parties and strictly not processed by spam recognition software hosted by
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] third party providers also do not obtain any information about
the results of spam recognition at posteo. [CLS] [SEP]

## payment data is not connected with email accounts

when paying via bank transfer or paypal, your name or the name of the paying
person as well as an iban (with bank transfers) is transmitted to us. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not receive any data about paying customers from credit card companies. [CLS] [SEP] at
posteo, payment data is strictly not connected with email accounts meaning
that transferred payment details do not not exist within an account. [CLS] [SEP] since our
founding in 2009 we use our own anonymisation process for all payment
processes that completely separates them from accounts. [CLS] [SEP] you can find detailed
information about this subject on our [information page about
payment](https://posteo.de/en/site/payment). [CLS] [SEP] this process protects your
sensitive payment data in the best possible way from potential data theft and
from abuse. [CLS] [SEP] as there is no payment information saved in your posteo account,
you cannot set up a standing order. [CLS] [SEP] payment for accounts is always prepaid. [CLS] [SEP]
you receive a receipt for your prepayment without a name, address or vat
statement. [CLS] [SEP] this receipt is a tax-relevant proof of payment. [CLS] [SEP] for tax purposes,
we are legally required to keep receipts of all payments for 10 years. [CLS] [SEP]
receipts are only kept for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] our procedure of anonymising the
payment processes has also been mentioned in the [audit report of the german
federal commissioner for data
protection](https://posteo.de/bfdi_pruefbericht.pdf). [CLS] [SEP] this report confirms
that payment data is not connected with email accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

back in 2014, the german federal government confirmed [in their
response](https://posteo.de/antwort_bundesregierung.pdf) to an inquiry by the
former german member of parliament, hans-christian strã¶bele, that there is no
requirement for email providers to connect payment data with an email account. [CLS] [SEP]

## no use of schufa (german credit investigation company)/collection agencies

we do not require any credit reports from schufa (german credit investigation
company) or any other credit reports about you. [CLS] [SEP] we also do not use the
services of collection agencies for delayed payments. [CLS] [SEP] all payments for posteo
accounts are made in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

## no advertising, no tracking, no integration of social media or google
products

posteo is free of tracking tools and advertising. [CLS] [SEP] we also do not send any
advertising emails to you. [CLS] [SEP] we work independently and do not have any
advertising partners. [CLS] [SEP] this is the only way an internet-based service can truly
be run in a privacy-oriented fashion. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, our website is free of social-media plug-ins like facebook,
twitter, etc. [CLS] [SEP] were we to integrate such plug-ins into our website, usage data
and personal data such as ip addresses would be transmitted to these services. [CLS] [SEP]
we do not want this. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not use any google products like google analytics or so-called captchas
from third-party providers. [CLS] [SEP] the captcha with which security questions are
asked when registering has been programmed by posteo and does not collect any
data from you such as your ip address. [CLS] [SEP]

you can subscribe to posteo's newsletter if you'd like by opting in within
your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] you have the option to unsubscribe from the newsletter
at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

## privacy-oriented password reset

you can activate our "forgotten password" feature in connection with your
mobile phone number in the settings of your account. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of a lost
password, you can have a new password sent to you via text message (sms). [CLS] [SEP] your
sensitive mobile telephone number is not transmitted to us when activating
this feature. [CLS] [SEP] we only receive a mathematically calculated result (a salted
hash) that we additionally secure again. [CLS] [SEP] this data is only a character string
and is not considered inventory data after a decision by the federal network
agency in 2017 with regard to posteo. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, they are not required by
law to be reported to government agencies. [CLS] [SEP] you can deactivate this feature at
any time in the settings of your account. [CLS] [SEP] by doing so, the character string
will also be deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

## posteo migration service: secure data transfer without third-party
providers

we have implemented a migration service of our own development because we do
not want to use or recommend solutions from third-party providers for
transferring your sensitive email data out of privacy reasons. [CLS] [SEP] with posteo's
migration service, you can safely transfer external email accounts of other
providers (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] gmx, web.de, icloud, etc.) including all folder structures
(with unlimited levels). [CLS] [SEP] you decide whether you'd like to copy the entire
contents of your previous email account or just selected folders. [CLS] [SEP] posteo
directly retrieves the selected folders from your previous provider and they
are transferred via an encrypted connection directly into your posteo account. [CLS] [SEP]
at no point in time is your data transmitted via third-party providers. [CLS] [SEP]
nowadays, it's also possible to transfer contacts and calendars from many
providers (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] gmx, web.de, icloud, etc.) in this same way. [CLS] [SEP] posteo's
migration service has been conceived based on our policy of maximum data
economy. [CLS] [SEP]  
after the migration has occurred, you can continue to have newly incoming
emails retrieved from your old account. [CLS] [SEP] this email collection is initially
only for three months but can be renewed an unlimited amount of times. [CLS] [SEP] data
entered for the purposes of the email collector are saved with encryption
until the email collector has been deleted by you. [CLS] [SEP] entered data for the
migration service is encrypted and held in working memory only for the
duration of the migration. [CLS] [SEP]

## data import and export

your data belongs to you. [CLS] [SEP] you can export and save all of your data stored at
posteo (emails, contacts, calendars, notes) locally at any time with the help
of open standards and freely available programs. [CLS] [SEP] it's also possible to import
data to your account in the same way. [CLS] [SEP] these standards are imap, pop3, smtp,
carddav and caldav. [CLS] [SEP] we provide instructions on how to import and export data
in our help section. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, you can also use our [migration
service](https://posteo.de/en/help/setup-posteo-migration-service) in many
cases for importing. [CLS] [SEP]

## no tracking cookies

we do not use any tracking or analytical cookies. [CLS] [SEP]  
we only use so-called session cookies in the customer menu when logging in and
in the webmailer. [CLS] [SEP] the data that is saved on your computer exclusively serves
for logging on and is especially not used to to create user profiles or
anything similar. [CLS] [SEP] session cookies are deleted at the end of each session. [CLS] [SEP] if
you use the simplified version of our homepage (eco-switch), one cookie will
be used that saves only one information: the information that the browser
should load the simplified version of the homepage when directed to our
website. [CLS] [SEP] if you change to the regular homepage, the cookie will be deleted. [CLS] [SEP]
this cookie will also not be used to track you or to create a user profile of
you. [CLS] [SEP]

## customer support without retention of personal data

you can contact our customer support with questions and problems related to
your posteo account at any time free of charge via email at support@posteo.de
or through the contact form on our website. [CLS] [SEP] our team provides support in
german, english and french. [CLS] [SEP]

data that you voluntarily send us in an inquiry via email, such as an
alternative email address for contacting you or a general inquiry, are not
saved as information to your email account with posteo. [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect ip
addresses if you use our contact form. [CLS] [SEP] for privacy reasons, our customer
support also works entirely without a customer database and ticket system. [CLS] [SEP]
there is no documentation of your contact made via email or about the
questions you have asked our customer support. [CLS] [SEP] your inquiry will only be
answered via email by our team. [CLS] [SEP] we exclusively use open source email clients
on encrypted computers for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP]  
all email correspondence will automatically be completely deleted at posteo 14
days after a case has been closed. [CLS] [SEP]

when you enter text in our contact form, it remains locally on your device
until it has been submitted. [CLS] [SEP] posteo stands for genuine privacy by design. [CLS] [SEP]
suggestions for solutions that may appear are kept locally in your browser and
displayed when you enter keywords. [CLS] [SEP] while you are typing, no data is
transmitted through the internet to posteo to compare the words you have
entered with a keyword database located at posteo. [CLS] [SEP]

## no transmission of data to third-party companies

at no point in time do we voluntarily give personal data to third party
companies or service contractors. [CLS] [SEP] all data is exclusively stored on our
servers in germany. [CLS] [SEP] posteo is financed by our customers: there are no
advertising partners or investors. [CLS] [SEP]

## requests by government agencies/transparency reports

in certain legally regulated cases, especially when presented with a court
order in cases of criminal offenses, we are required when applicable to
release an account. [CLS] [SEP] we document how often government agencies have attempted
to acquire such data from posteo in our [transparency
reports](https://posteo.de/en/site/transparency_report). [CLS] [SEP] inventory data or
personally identifiable ip addresses do not exist for posteo accounts and
cannot be released. [CLS] [SEP]

## your rights according to the general data protection regulation (legally
required part of the privacy policy)

we do neither collect or save inventory data (like names or address) nor
personally identifiable ip addresses from you. [CLS] [SEP]  
nevertheless, we are legally required to fully inform you of your rights in
our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we hereby do so. [CLS] [SEP]

## you have the right:

in accordance with **gdpr article 15** you have the right to demand a
confirmation from posteo e.k. [CLS] [SEP] as to whether we process personal data in
relation to you. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, we will confirm in writing that we do not have
any inventory data or personally identifiable ip addresses and that no
customer database entry exists in relation to you. [CLS] [SEP] we will confirm that
payment data must be retained in written form for 10 years for tax authorities
but also that payment data does not exist within your email account and has no
connection to your account. [CLS] [SEP] we will answer that you can delete or export saved
content data at any point in time in your non-personally-identifiable email
account. [CLS] [SEP]

in accordance with **gdpr article 16** you have the right to immediately
demand the correction or completion of personal data that is stored within a
company in relation to you. [CLS] [SEP] as no inventory data such as names or addresses in
relation to your email account is collected at posteo as well as payment data
is not saved in relation to an account, no such data set exist on which we
could make such changes (correction/completion). [CLS] [SEP] we only retain payment data
for tax purposes. [CLS] [SEP] changes cannot be made to this data. [CLS] [SEP]

in accordance with **gdpr article 17** you have the right to demand the
immediate deletion of personal data that is saved within a company in relation
to you. [CLS] [SEP] inventory data as well as personally identifiable ip addresses do not
exist at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] payment data cannot be deleted upon your request as it would
conflict with legal requirement of retaining this information for 10 years for
tax authorities. [CLS] [SEP] payment details are not connected with email accounts and
therefore do not exist in connection with your account. [CLS] [SEP] we only keep payment
data for tax purposes. [CLS] [SEP] this data cannot be deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

in accordance with **gdpr article 18** you have the right to demand a
restriction of the processing of personal data that is stored at a company in
relation to you. [CLS] [SEP] inventory data and personally identifiable ip addresses do
not exist at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] we only retain payment data for tax purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
restrictions of the processing of this data cannot be made due to tax reasons. [CLS] [SEP]

if companies give personal data to third parties, the company must inform the
recipients if personal data has been corrected or deleted according to **gdpr
article 19**. [CLS] [SEP]  
you have the right to request to which recipients this information went from
the company. [CLS] [SEP]  
as no inventory data such as names or addresses in relation to your email
account is collected at posteo, no such data set exist with which we could
pass on to third parties or with which we could make changes
(corrections/deletions). [CLS] [SEP]

should you have provided a company with personal data in an automated process,
you have the right to receive this stored personal data in a structured,
current and machine-readable format or to demand the transfer of this data to
another responsible party according to **gdpr article 20**. [CLS] [SEP] at least within
technical possibilities. [CLS] [SEP]  

in accordance with **gdpr article 21** you have the right to revoke the
processing of personal data within a company. [CLS] [SEP] we neither collect inventory
data nor personally identifiable ip addresses from you and your email account
at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] we only retain payment data for tax purposes and this cannot be
revoked. [CLS] [SEP]

in accordance with **gdpr article 7 paragraph 3** , you also have the right to
revoke given consent of the processing of personal data from a company. [CLS] [SEP] we
neither collect inventory data nor personally identifiable ip addresses from
you and your email account at posteo. [CLS] [SEP] we only retain payment data for tax
purposes and this cannot be revoked. [CLS] [SEP]

in accordance with **gdpr article 22** you also have the right not to be
subject to a resulting decision from an automated process including profiling. [CLS] [SEP]  
at no point in time will you be subject to a resulting decision from an
automated process (including profiling) at posteo. [CLS] [SEP]

should a company store any of your personal data, the company has to inform
you immediately if the protection of your data has been infringed upon
according to **gdpr article 34**. [CLS] [SEP] as a matter of principle, we do not store
any inventory data, payment data or personally identifiable ip addresses for
your email account. [CLS] [SEP]  
due to our data economy and the protection of sensitive data, we conceptually
prevent the theft and other abuse of customer data related to your account
through maximal "privacy by design". [CLS] [SEP]  
in the case of a security related incident that could affect the security of
your data stored at posteo, we will inform you via email and in our
companyâs blog. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, we will explain how to contact our data
protection officer and offer tips for suitable measures. [CLS] [SEP]

according to **gdpr article 77** , you have the right to raise a complaint
with a supervisory authority. [CLS] [SEP] the competent supervisory authorities are:

the german federal commissioner for data protection (bfdi)  
husarenstr. [CLS] [SEP] 30  
53117 bonn  
germany

the federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information of
berlin  
maja smoltczyk  
friedrichstr. [CLS] [SEP] 219  
10969 berlin  
germany

## actuality and changes in this privacy policy

this privacy policy is currently valid and is applicable as of july 2019. [CLS] [SEP]  
it may become necessary to change this privacy policy as posteo develops or
based on changes in legal or official guidelines. [CLS] [SEP] the respectively current
privacy policy can be accessed and printed at any time on our website:
