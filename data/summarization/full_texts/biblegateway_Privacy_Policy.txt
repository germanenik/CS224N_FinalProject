### _information obtained by automated means through our services_

we also may obtain certain information through our services by automated
means, such as cookies (including http, html5 and flash cookies), web beacons,

settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as apple

media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social
media network and friends lists. [CLS] [SEP] the specific information we obtain depends on
your privacy settings on the applicable social media network. [CLS] [SEP]

services, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to
collect information regarding your interactions with these features. [CLS] [SEP] this
information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is
subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. [CLS] [SEP] the company is
not responsible for those providers’ information practices. [CLS] [SEP]
