servers and databases. [CLS] [SEP] by using our services you agree to assume all risk in

services. [CLS] [SEP] in the unlikely event that we believe the security of your
information may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. [CLS] [SEP]

california law permits visitors who are california residents to request a list
of the third parties to which we have disclosed personal information (as
defined under california law) for such third parties’ direct marketing
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you are limited to one request per calendar year. [CLS] [SEP] in your request,
please attest to the fact that you are a california resident and provide a
current california address for our response. [CLS] [SEP] you may submit this request by
email at [compliance@howtogeek.com](mailto:contact@howtogeek.com). [CLS] [SEP]

(“ccpa”), you have a right to request that we disclose to you the categories
of personal information we have collected from you, the categories of sources
from which such information has been collected, the business or commercial
purpose for which your information has been collected, the categories of third
parties with whom your personal information is shared, and the specific pieces
of personal information that have been collected about you. [CLS] [SEP] to exercise your
right to disclosure and request these details about your personal information
which has been collected by us, you can make that request by contacting us at
[compliance@howtogeek.com](mailto:contact@howtogeek.com). [CLS] [SEP] because, for your
security, we require you to prove your identity before granting access to your
information, we will verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] the information we collect from you
in connection with this verification of your identity will be used solely for
the purposes of verifying, responding to, and logging to your request. [CLS] [SEP]

you also have a right under the ccpa to request that your personal information
not be sold, and to request disclosure of your personal information which has
been sold by a business. [CLS] [SEP] we do not sell your personal information other than
as described in this privacy policy, and have not sold any consumer personal
information in the last 12 months, however, our advertisers reserve the right
to do so. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, because of our commitment to data transparency and
privacy, we still make it possible for you to register your preference for
opting out of the sale of your personal information, and you may do so at this
link. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, you have the right to request that we delete personal
information that we may have collected from you. [CLS] [SEP] to request that your
information be deleted, you can make that request by contacting us at
[compliance@howtogeek.com](mailto:contact@howtogeek.com). [CLS] [SEP] for your security,
we will require you to prove your identity before granting access to your
information. [CLS] [SEP] the information we collect from you in connection with this
verification of your identity will be used solely for the purposes of
verifying, responding to, and logging to your request. [CLS] [SEP] in certain
circumstances we have the right to retain information, even in the event of a
request to remove the information. [CLS] [SEP]

you may designate an authorized agent to exercise your disclosure and deletion
rights under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to do this, you must provide the agent with
written permission to exercise your rights, and you must verify your own
identity with us. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to designate an agent in this way, please
contact us at [compliance@howtogeek.com](mailto:contact@howtogeek.com). [CLS] [SEP]

you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights
under the ccpa, and we do not discriminate against consumers on based on their
exercise of any of these rights. [CLS] [SEP]

## viii. [CLS] [SEP] information from children

age 13. [CLS] [SEP] no one under 13 years of age is allowed to provide any personal
information or use our public forums, chats, etc. [CLS] [SEP] minors between 13 – 17 years
of age must get permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before
using our services. [CLS] [SEP] if we discover that we have received any personal
information from a child under the age of 13, we will take reasonable steps to
delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

## ix. [CLS] [SEP] questions
