#  terms & conditions

## bumble terms and conditions of use

welcome to bumble’s terms and conditions of use (these “terms”). [CLS] [SEP] this is a
contract between you and the bumble group (as defined further below) and we
want you to know yours and our rights before you use the bumble application
(“bumble” or the “app”). [CLS] [SEP] please take a few moments to read these terms before
enjoying the app, because once you access, view or use the app, you are going
to be legally bound by these terms (so probably best to read them first!). [CLS] [SEP]

 **please be aware that if you subscribe to services for a term (the “initial
term”), then the terms of your subscription will be automatically renewed for
additional periods of the same duration as the initial term at bumble’s then-
current fee for such services, unless you cancel your subscription in
accordance with section 5 below.**

you should also note that section 13 of these terms contains provisions
governing how claims that you and bumble group have against each other are
resolved. [CLS] [SEP] **in particular, it contains an arbitration agreement that will,
with limited exceptions, require disputes between us to be submitted to
binding and final arbitration.** if you are an existing user or a new user who
signed up for bumble before january 18, 2021, you have a right to opt out of
the arbitration agreement pursuant to section 13 below. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not opt out
of the arbitration agreement in accordance with section 13, or if you sign up
for bumble after january 18, 2021, (1) you will only be permitted to pursue
claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis only; and (2) you are
waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial
on your claims. [CLS] [SEP]

and a notice to california subscribers: you may cancel your subscription and
request a refund at any time prior to midnight of the third business day
following the date you subscribed. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribed using your apple id,
refunds are handled by apple, not bumble. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to request a refund,
please visit <https://getsupport.apple.com>. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribed using your
google play store account or through bumble, please contact [customer
support](https://bumble.com/en/help/#contact-us). [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] bumble rules

  2. [CLS] [SEP] be legally permitted to use the app by the laws of your home country. [CLS] [SEP]

you can create an account via manual registration, or by using your facebook
login details. [CLS] [SEP] if you create an account using your facebook login details, you
authorise us to access, display and use certain information from your facebook
account (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] profile pictures, relationship status, location and information
about facebook friends). [CLS] [SEP] for more information about what information we use

the right to terminate or suspend your account without notice (1) for
violating these terms, (2) due to your conduct on the app, or your conduct

sole discretion, determine your conduct was inappropriate or improper, (3) if
we or our affiliates, in our or their sole discretion, determine your conduct
on other apps operated by our affiliates was inappropriate or improper, or (4)
for any reasons whatsoever that we deem, in our sole discretion, justifies

### your content

you agree that your content must comply with our guidelines at
<https://bumble.com/en/guidelines>, as updated from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] as your
content is unique, you are responsible and liable for your content and will
indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in
connection with your content. [CLS] [SEP] sorry that was a bit of a mouthful, but you are
what you post!

you may not display any personal contact or banking information on your
individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for
example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email
addresses, urls, credit/debit card or other banking details). [CLS] [SEP] if you do choose
to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via
email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to use the same
caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you
would under any other circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

as bumble is a public community, your content will be visible to other users
of the app all around the world instantly - so make sure you are comfortable
sharing your content before you post. [CLS] [SEP] as such, you agree that your content may
be viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is
sent a link to the app (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] individuals who receive a link to a user’s
profile or shared content from other bumble users). [CLS] [SEP] by uploading your content
on bumble, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights
and licences to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty
free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use your content in any way (including,
without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating,
reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works,
advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public
such content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium
currently known or developed in the future). [CLS] [SEP]

we may assign and/or sub-license the above licence to our affiliates and
successors without any further approval by you. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not have any obligation to store your content - if it’s important, you
should make a copy. [CLS] [SEP]

### member content

other members of bumble will also share content via the app. [CLS] [SEP] member content
belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and
displayed via the app at the direction of the user providing the member
content. [CLS] [SEP]

you do not have any rights in relation to other users’ member content, and you
may only use other bumble users’ personal information to the extent that your
use of it matches bumble’s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. [CLS] [SEP] you
may not use other users’ information for commercial purposes, to spam, to
harass, stalk or to make unlawful threats. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to terminate
your account if you misuse other users’ information. [CLS] [SEP]

member content is subject to the terms and conditions of sections 512(c)
and/or 512(d) of the digital millennium copyright act 1998. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a
complaint about member content, please see the digital millennium copyright
act section below for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

### our content

you may be wondering what happens to the rest of the content on bumble. [CLS] [SEP] well,
it belongs to us! any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces,
trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, and other intellectual property appearing
on bumble are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by
copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights. [CLS] [SEP] all right,
title and interest in and to our content remains with us at all times. [CLS] [SEP]

we grant you a non-exclusive, limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable,
licence to access and use our content, without the right to sublicense, under
the following conditions:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not use, sell, modify, or distribute our content except as permitted by the functionality of the app;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not use our name in metatags, keywords and/or hidden text;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not create derivative works from our content or commercially exploit our content, in whole or in part, in any way; and
  4. [CLS] [SEP] you shall use our content for lawful purposes only. [CLS] [SEP] 

we reserve all other rights. [CLS] [SEP]

 **no obligation to pre-screen content.**

since bumble is an online community, we generally try to avoid getting in the
way and therefore don’t assume any obligation to pre-screen any of your
content or any member content. [CLS] [SEP] however, there may be times where we need to
step in, and we reserve the right to review, pre-screen, refuse and/or remove
any member content and your content, including content exchanged between users
in direct messages. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] restrictions on the app

you agree to:

  * comply with all applicable laws, including without limitation, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, anti-spam laws, equal opportunity laws and regulatory requirements;
  * use your real name on your profile; and
  * use the services in a professional manner. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that you will not:

  * act in an unlawful or unprofessional manner including being dishonest, abusive or discriminatory;
  * misrepresent your identity, your current or previous positions, qualifications or affiliations with a person or entity;
  * disclose information that you do not have the consent to disclose;
  * stalk or harass any other user of the app; or
  * create or operate a pyramid scheme, fraud or other similar practice. [CLS] [SEP]

we don’t like users misbehaving in the bumble community. [CLS] [SEP] you can report any
abuse or complain about member content by contacting us, outlining the abuse
and/or complaint. [CLS] [SEP] you can also report a user directly from a profile or in
chat by clicking the ‘block & report’ link. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to
investigate any possible violations of these terms, and we may, in our sole
discretion, immediately terminate any user’s right to use of the app without
prior notice, as set out further in section 1 above. [CLS] [SEP]

we don’t control any of the things our users say or do, so you are solely
responsible for your interactions with other users of the app. [CLS] [SEP]

**you understand that bumble group does not currently conduct criminal
background checks on its users. [CLS] [SEP] bumble group also does not inquire into the
backgrounds of its users or attempt to verify the statements of its users. [CLS] [SEP]
bumble group makes no representations or warranties as to the conduct of any
users or their compatibility with any current or future users. [CLS] [SEP] bumble group
reserves the right to conduct any criminal background check or other
screenings (such as sex offender registration searches) at any time and to use
available public records for any purpose.**

you agree to, and hereby do, release bumble group and its successors from any
claims, demands, losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including
personal injuries, death and property damage, that either directly or
indirectly arises from your interactions with or conduct of other users of the
app. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california resident, you hereby waive california civil code
section 1542, which states, “a general release does not extend to claims that
the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or
her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or
her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
released party.” the foregoing release does not apply to any claims, demands,
or any losses, damages, rights and actions of any kind, including personal
injuries, death or property damage for any unconscionable commercial practice
by bumble group or for such party’s fraud, deception, false, promise,
misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact
in connection with the app. [CLS] [SEP]

scraping or replicating any part of the app without our prior consent is
expressly prohibited. [CLS] [SEP] this includes by any means (automated or otherwise)
other than through our currently available, published interfaces - unless you
have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] privacy

for information about how the bumble group collects, uses, and shares your
personal data, please check out our [privacy policy](/en/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] by using
bumble, you acknowledge that we may use such data in accordance with our
[privacy policy](/en/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] payment terms

**generally.**

bumble may offer products and services for purchase on the app (“in-app
purchase”). [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to make an in-app purchase, you acknowledge and
agree that additional terms, disclosed to you at the point of purchase, may
apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference. [CLS] [SEP]

you may make an in-app purchase through the following payment methods
(“payment method”): (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform such
as the apple app store and google play store (“third party store”), or (b)
paying with your credit card, debit card, or paypal account, which will be
processed by a third-party processor. [CLS] [SEP] once you have made an in-app purchase,
you authorise us to charge your chosen payment method. [CLS] [SEP] if payment is not
received by us from your chosen payment method, you agree to promptly pay all
amounts due upon demand by us. [CLS] [SEP]

 **subscriptions and auto-renewal:** bumble may offer some services as
automatically-renewing subscriptions, e.g., a one-week subscription, one-month
subscription, or three-month subscription (“premium services”). [CLS] [SEP] **if you
purchase an automatically renewing subscription, your subscription will renew
at the end of the period, unless you cancel, at bumble’s then-current price
for such subscriptions.** to avoid charges for a new subscription period, you
must cancel, as described below, before the end of the then-current
subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account or deleting the application from
your device does not cancel your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] you will be given notice of
changes in the pricing of the premium services to which you have subscribed
and an opportunity to cancel. [CLS] [SEP] if bumble changes these prices and you do not
cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be charged at bumble’s then-
current pricing for subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

 **cancelling subscriptions.** if you purchased a subscription directly from
bumble, you may cancel or change your payment method via the payment settings
option under your profile. [CLS] [SEP] if you purchased a subscription through a third
party store, such as the apple app store or the google play store, you will
need to access your account with that third party store and follow
instructions to change or cancel your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel your
subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you
last paid for, but (i) you will not (except as set forth in the subsection
entitled “refunds” below) be eligible for a prorated refund, (ii) your
subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and (iii) you will
then no longer be able to use the premium services or in-app purchases enabled
by your subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

 **free trials.** if you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your
trial may convert into a paid subscription and your payment method will be
charged at the then-current price for such subscription. [CLS] [SEP] once your free trial
converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will continue to
automatically renew at the end of each period, and your payment method will be
charged, until you cancel. [CLS] [SEP] to avoid charges for a new subscription period, you
must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free
trial period as described above. [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account or deleting the
application from your device does not cancel your free trial. [CLS] [SEP]

 **refunds. [CLS] [SEP] generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there
are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.**

for subscribers residing in arizona, california, connecticut, illinois, iowa,
minnesota, new york, north carolina, ohio, rhode island, and wisconsin, the
terms below apply:

you may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time
prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your
estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had
made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use bumble)
before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund
of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is
allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice
in the same manner as you request a refund as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

to request a refund:

in addition to canceling, you must request a refund to receive one. [CLS] [SEP] if you
subscribed using your apple id, refunds are handled by apple, not bumble. [CLS] [SEP] to
request a refund, go to itunes, click on your apple id, select “purchase
history,” find the transaction and hit “report problem”. [CLS] [SEP] you can also submit a
request at <https://getsupport.apple.com>. [CLS] [SEP]

for all other purchases: please contact [customer
support](https://bumble.com/en/help/#contact-us) with your order number (you
can find the order number in the order confirmation email, or if you purchased
from the google play store by logging in to google wallet). [CLS] [SEP] you may also mail
or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are
canceling this agreement, or words of similar effect. [CLS] [SEP] please also include the
email address or mobile number associated with your account along with your
order number. [CLS] [SEP] this notice shall be sent to: bumble, attn.: cancellations, p.o. [CLS] [SEP]
box 300940, austin, texas, 78703 (in addition, california and ohio members may
send a facsimile to 512-696-1545). [CLS] [SEP]

 **taxes.**

the payments required under this section 5 do not include any sales tax that
may be due in connection with the premium services provided under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
if bumble determines it has a legal obligation to collect a sales tax from you
in connection with these terms, bumble will collect such sales tax in addition
to the payments required under this section 5. [CLS] [SEP] if any premium services, or
payments for any premium services, under these terms are subject to any sales
tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable sales tax to
bumble, you will be responsible for the payment of such sales tax and any
related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority. [CLS] [SEP] as used herein,
“sales tax” means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales
proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable
taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] virtual items

at times, you may be able to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, revocable licence to access special limited-use features
from bumble, referred to here as “virtual items.” you can only purchase
virtual items through bumble or bumble’s partners. [CLS] [SEP] virtual items represent a
limited license right governed by this agreement, and, except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to virtual items is
being transferred or assigned to you. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement, and your purchase of
virtual items, does not constitute the sale of any rights in virtual items. [CLS] [SEP]

any virtual item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-
world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead shows the extent of
your licence to access virtual items. [CLS] [SEP] virtual items do not incur fees for non-
use. [CLS] [SEP] your licence in virtual items will terminate on the earlier of bumble
ceasing provision of services or your account closing or terminating. [CLS] [SEP] bumble
may also at times provide virtual items as bonuses to, or parts of, paid
subscriptions for its services. [CLS] [SEP] your ability to use virtual items you have
access to in this manner may terminate at the end of each of your subscription
periods and your access to virtual items may not “roll over” or accumulate
through additional subscription periods. [CLS] [SEP] your access to virtual items gained
through subscriptions may also end if you cancel your subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

bumble, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the
right to access or use virtual items and/or may distribute virtual items with
or without charge. [CLS] [SEP] bumble may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate
virtual items at any time, including taking actions that may impact the
perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of any virtual items and
bumble shall have no liability to you for doing so. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not sell,
redeem, or otherwise transfer virtual items to any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP] virtual
items may only be redeemed through our services. [CLS] [SEP]

all purchases and redemptions of virtual items made through our services are
final and non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that bumble is not required to
provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other
compensation for unused virtual items when an account is closed, whether such
closure was voluntary or involuntary. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] push notifications; location-based features

we may provide you with emails, text messages, push notifications, alerts and
other messages related to the app and/or the bumble services, such as
enhancements, offers, products, events, and other promotions. [CLS] [SEP] after
downloading the app, you will be asked to accept or deny push
notifications/alerts. [CLS] [SEP] if you deny, you will not receive any push
notifications/alerts. [CLS] [SEP] if you accept, push notifications/alerts will be
automatically sent to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you no longer wish to receive push
notifications/alerts from the app, you may opt out by changing your
notification settings on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to other types of
messaging or communications, such as emails, text messages, etc., you can
unsubscribe or opt out by either following the specific instructions included
in such communications, or by emailing us with your request at
[feedback@team.bumble.com](mailto:feedback@team.bumble.com). [CLS] [SEP]

the app may allow access to or make available opportunities for you to view
certain content and receive other products, services and/or other materials
based on your location. [CLS] [SEP] to make these opportunities available to you, the app
will determine your location using one or more reference points, such as gps,
bluetooth and/or software within your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] if you have set your
mobile device to disable gps, bluetooth or other location determining software
or do not authorise the app to access your location data, you will not be able
to access such location-specific content, products, services and materials. [CLS] [SEP]
for more about how the app uses and retains your information, please read the
[privacy policy](/en/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer

the app, site, our content, and member content are all provided to you “as is”
and “as available” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied,
including but not limited to, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-
infringement. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, we do not guarantee the
compatibility of any matches. [CLS] [SEP]

should applicable law not permit the foregoing exclusion of express or implied
warranties, then we grant the minimum express or implied warranty required by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or information, whether oral or written, shall
create any warranty, representation or guarantee not expressly stated in this
section. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, we do not make any warranties that the app or site will be
uninterrupted, secure or error free or that your use of the app or site will
meet your expectations, or that the app, site, our content, any member
content, or any portion thereof, is correct, accurate, or reliable. [CLS] [SEP] your use
of the app or site is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for your
interactions with other members. [CLS] [SEP] the bumble group is not responsible for the
conduct of any user. [CLS] [SEP] bumble group does not conduct criminal background checks
on its members. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

neither us nor any owner will be liable for any damages, direct, indirect,
incidental, consequential, special, or punitive, including, without
limitation, loss of data, income, profit or goodwill, loss of or damage to
property and claims of third parties arising out of your access to or use of
the app, site, our content, or any member content, however caused, whether
based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), proprietary rights
infringement, product liability or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

the foregoing shall apply even if we were advised of the possibility of such
damages. [CLS] [SEP] if you become dissatisfied in any way with the app or site, your sole
and exclusive remedy is to stop your use of the app and site. [CLS] [SEP]

you hereby waive any and all claims arising out of your use of the app or
site. [CLS] [SEP] because some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, these provisions may
not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] if any portion of this limitation on liability is found to
be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then our aggregate liability shall
not exceed one hundred dollars ($100). [CLS] [SEP]

the limitation of liability herein is a fundamental element of the basis of
the bargain and reflects a fair allocation of risk. [CLS] [SEP] the app and site would not
be provided without such limitations and you agree that the limitations and
exclusions of liability, disclaimers and exclusive remedies specified herein
will survive even if found to have failed in their essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] the
foregoing does not apply to liability arising from any fraud or fraudulent
misrepresentations, or any other liability that cannot be limited by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnity

all the actions you make and information you post on bumble remain your
responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold
us, and our partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents, harmless, from and against any third
party claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), actions, proceedings,
demands, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees) suffered or reasonably incurred by us arising as a result of, or in
connection with:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] any negligent acts, omissions or wilful misconduct by you;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] your access to and use of the app;

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] third party app store

the following additional terms and conditions apply to you if you download the
app from a third party store. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent that the other terms and
conditions of these terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict
with, the terms and conditions of this section, the more restrictive or
conflicting terms and conditions in this section will apply, but solely with
respect to the app and the third party store. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are concluded solely between you and the bumble group and not with the providers of the third party store, and the bumble group (and not the third party store providers) is solely responsible for the app and the content thereof. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent that these terms provide for usage rules for the app which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the third party store from which you obtain the app, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the third party store will take precedence and will apply. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] the third party store provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the app. [CLS] [SEP] the bumble group is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. [CLS] [SEP] the third party store provider will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of the bumble group. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] the bumble group, not the third party store provider, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have relating to the app or your possession and/or use of the app, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual property infringement claims. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the third party store provider and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these terms, and, upon your acceptance of these terms, the third party store provider from whom you obtained the app will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event of a conflict between a third party store’s or mobile carrier’s
applicable terms and conditions and these terms, the terms and conditions of
the third party store or mobile carrier shall govern and control. [CLS] [SEP] we are not
responsible and have no liability whatsoever for third-party goods or services
you obtain through a third party store or mobile carrier. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to
make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before
proceeding with any online transaction with any of these third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

**please read the following arbitration agreement in this section
(“arbitration agreement”) carefully. [CLS] [SEP] unless you opt out in the manner
described in subsection 7 below, this agreement requires you to arbitrate
disputes with bumble group and limits the manner in which you seek relief from
us.**

 **1\. [CLS] [SEP] when does this arbitration agreement apply?** this arbitration
agreement applies to any dispute or claim relating to your use of our app or
any other aspect of your relationship with bumble group. [CLS] [SEP] it requires that, and
by entering into these terms you agree, that such claims will be resolved by
binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert
claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or bumble
group may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of
intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

 **2\. [CLS] [SEP] how do you start the arbitration process?** to begin the arbitration
proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
claim to our registered agent: ct corporation, 1209 orange street, city of
wilmington, county of new castle, delaware 19801. [CLS] [SEP]

 **3\. [CLS] [SEP] what are the rules of arbitration?** the federal arbitration act
governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitration will be governed by jams, an established alternative dispute
resolution provider. [CLS] [SEP] disputes involving claims and counterclaims under
$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to
jams’ most current version of the streamlined arbitration rules and procedures
available at: <http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/>. [CLS] [SEP] all
other claims will be subject to jams’ most current version of the
comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures, available at:
http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. [CLS] [SEP] jams’ rules are also
available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling jams at 800-352-5267. [CLS] [SEP] if jams is
not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
forum. [CLS] [SEP] if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay jams’ filing,
administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from
jams, bumble group will pay them for you. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, bumble group will
reimburse all such jams’ filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for
claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims
are frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]

you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another
mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP]

 **4\. [CLS] [SEP] what can the arbitrator decide?** the arbitrator has the exclusive
authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability or formation of this arbitration agreement
including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this
arbitration agreement is void or voidable. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will have the
authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law,
the arbitral forum’s rules, and the agreement (including the arbitration
agreement). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of
decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator has
the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
court of law would have. [CLS] [SEP] the award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
you and us. [CLS] [SEP]

 **5\. [CLS] [SEP] no jury trials.** by agreeing to arbitration, you and bumble group are
each agreeing to waive our rights to a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] instead, you and bumble
group are electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by
arbitration under this arbitration agreement, except as described in section
13(1) above. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages
and relief as a court and must follow this agreement as a court would. [CLS] [SEP]
however, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
arbitration award is subject to very limited review. [CLS] [SEP]

 **6\. [CLS] [SEP] one at a time.** all claims and disputes within the scope of this
arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a
class or collective basis, and you give up your right to participate in a
class action or any other class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] only individual relief is
available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated
or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration
proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
other cases or parties. [CLS] [SEP] if a decision is issued stating that applicable law
precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given
claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and
brought into the state or federal courts located in travis county, texas. [CLS] [SEP] all
other claims shall be arbitrated. [CLS] [SEP]

 **7\. [CLS] [SEP] 31-day right to opt. [CLS] [SEP] this opt out section does not apply to new members
after january 18, 2021.** you have the right to opt out of the provisions of
this arbitration agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt
out to: **bumbleoptout@team.bumble.com** , within 31 days after first becoming
subject to this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] your notice must include your name and
address, your bumble username (if any), the email address you used to set up
your bumble account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you
want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of this
arbitration agreement, all other parts of this agreement will continue to
apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any
other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the
future, with us. [CLS] [SEP]

 **8\. [CLS] [SEP] severability.** except as provided in subsection 13(6), if any part or
parts of this arbitration agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and
effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the arbitration agreement
shall continue in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

 **9\. [CLS] [SEP] survival of agreement.** the terms of this arbitration agreement will
continue, even after your relationship with bumble group has ended. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous

### we know our terms are awesome, but we may have to change them now and
again

as bumble grows, we might have to make changes to these terms so we reserve
the right to modify, amend or change the terms at any time (a “change”). [CLS] [SEP] if we
do this then the changes will be posted on this page and we will indicate the
effective date of the updates at the bottom of the terms. [CLS] [SEP] in certain

our users to be as informed as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

your continued use of bumble following any change constitutes your acceptance

deleted from the terms and the remainder of the terms shall survive, remain in
full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]

no failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the
