this is our notice of privacy policy, and we’ll provide it the first time we
do business with you and upon request or as required by law thereafter. [CLS] [SEP]

this notice describes how we protect, collect, use, and share customer
information. [CLS] [SEP] customer information means all nonpublic information related to
an identified individual, which is sometimes called personally identifiable
information. [CLS] [SEP] customer information does not include anonymized data or de-
identified data, which do not identify an individual. [CLS] [SEP]

#####  our privacy principles

  * we do not sell customer information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we contractually require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to protect state farm customer information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not share customer medical information within the state farm family of companies unless: 
    * you expressly authorize it; or
    * it is permitted or required by law; or
    * your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may share customer information and permit others to use that information if you give us your consent, it is necessary to complete a transaction you request, or it is otherwise permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we handle information about former and prospective customers the same as existing customers. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

* * *

#####  we protect customer information

we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
customer information and to comply with federal and state laws. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
we review our policies and practices, monitor our computer networks, and test
the strength of our security. [CLS] [SEP]

we retain customer information for legal, auditing, regulatory, and business
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

* * *

#####  customer information we collect

we collect customer information in different ways. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we gather
information from:

  * applications and other forms related to our products and through conversations with state farm representatives, including our agents. [CLS] [SEP]
  * use of [statefarm.com®,](https://www.statefarm.com/ "state farm") our mobile sites and applications, our social media sites and applications, and interactions with our online advertisements. [CLS] [SEP]
  * transactions or experiences with us, such as payments, underwriting, and claims. [CLS] [SEP]
  * within the state farm family of companies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * non-state farm parties, including consumer reporting agencies that provide us with information such as driving records, claim histories, and credit information. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

* * *

#####  how we use customer information

we use customer information, sometimes including consumer report information,
to do things such as:

  * underwrite and rate your policies and accounts. [CLS] [SEP]
  * process your claims. [CLS] [SEP]
  * protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provide proper billing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * confirm your identity and service your policies and accounts. [CLS] [SEP]
  * enhance your customer experience and improve our products and services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * offer you other insurance and financial services products. [CLS] [SEP]
  * develop and offer new products and services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * develop either anonymized data or de-identified data by making reasonable efforts to remove personally identifiable information so the information is no longer customer information. [CLS] [SEP] we develop this data for certain purposes, such as analysis to understand more about our customers and our industry, or for other commercial purposes as permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] we share and use this data within our state farm family of companies, with third party service providers, or with other unaffiliated entities. [CLS] [SEP]
  * perform other activities as required or permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

#####  how we share customer information

with you (such as payments) and experiences with you (such as an auto claim),
within our state farm family of companies and with state farm agents to help
meet your product and service needs. [CLS] [SEP] we share customer information inside or
outside our family of companies:

  * for our everyday business purposes, for public policy purposes, and as permitted (such as with consent or as necessary to complete a transaction you request) or required by law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as needed, to handle your claim. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share name, address, and coverage information with an auto body shop to speed up repairs on auto damage claims. [CLS] [SEP]
  * with consumer reporting agencies, for example, during the underwriting process. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer, or exchange of all or a portion of our business or operating unit. [CLS] [SEP]
  * with companies that perform marketing or other services for us or with whom we have joint marketing agreements. [CLS] [SEP] these agreements allow us to provide a broader selection of insurance and financial products to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as needed, to protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions and in connection with the investigation, establishment, and defense of legal rights. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

* * *

#####  to limit the sharing of customer information within the state farm
family of companies

prefer to limit sharing information such as your driving record, claim history
with other companies, and credit information, call your state farm agent or
800-865-6035. [CLS] [SEP] please note, your choice:

  * will apply to joint policyholders or account holders on shared policies and accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

information sharing preference, no action is needed unless you want to change
your preference. [CLS] [SEP]

information across our state farm family of companies unless authorized by
