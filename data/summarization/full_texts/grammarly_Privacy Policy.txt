## information collection and use

### what information does grammarly collect about me?

when you interact with our site, software, and/or services, we collect
information that could be used to identify you (“personal data”). [CLS] [SEP] some of the
information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you
(“non-personal data”). [CLS] [SEP]

#### information you provide us when you create an account

  * names of user contacts (if you are using the grammarly keyboard). [CLS] [SEP] the grammarly keyboard may request or obtain access to the names of your contacts on your device.

of the site, software, and/or services are automatically logged in our
systems, including:

  * log data. [CLS] [SEP] as with most websites and technology services delivered over the internet, our servers automatically collect data when you access or use our site, software, and/or services and record it in log files. [CLS] [SEP] this log data may include ip address, browser type and settings, date and time of use, information about browser configuration, language preferences, and cookie data. [CLS] [SEP]

  * usage information. [CLS] [SEP] this is information about the grammarly site, software, and/or services you use and how you use them. [CLS] [SEP] we may also obtain data from our third-party partners and service providers to analyze how users use our site, software, and/or services.

[CLS] [SEP] we use this aggregated information to better understand and optimize the site. [CLS] [SEP]

  * device information. [CLS] [SEP] this is data from your computer or mobile device, such as the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system and browser type), as well as unique device identifiers for devices that are using grammarly software. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information collected from other sources

we may collect information about you from third parties, such as marketing
partners and researchers, where they are legally allowed to share your
information with us. [CLS] [SEP] we may combine the information we receive from other
sources with information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as
