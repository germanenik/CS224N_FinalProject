## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction

hulu, llc (“hulu,” “we” or “us”) respects your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy
explains the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you,
including personal information, in connection with your use of the hulu
services. [CLS] [SEP] the term “hulu services” refers to our video service, including the
selection of television shows, clips, movies, and other content we offer
(collectively, the “content”) and our player for viewing the content (the
“video player”), as well as any other products, features, tools, materials, or
other services offered from time to time by hulu through a variety of access
points. [CLS] [SEP] the term “access points” refers to, collectively, the hulu.com website
(the “hulu site”), applications, and other places through which the hulu
services may be accessed, including websites and applications of hulu’s third-
party distribution partners and other websites where users or website
operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the video player. [CLS] [SEP]
the information practices of third-party access points are governed by their
own privacy policies and are not governed by this privacy policy; accordingly,
we recommend you review the privacy policies of these third parties. [CLS] [SEP] please
also note that the hulu services may contain links to other sites owned or
operated by other companies, including our advertisers, and hulu does not
notify you when you have chosen to click through to another website or
property when using the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you review the
privacy policies of such other websites or properties. [CLS] [SEP]

by viewing any content or otherwise using the hulu services, whether you are a
subscriber, other registered user, or a visitor who has not subscribed to or
registered for the hulu services, you consent to the collection and use of
information from or about you as explained in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] **if you do
not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in
accordance with this privacy policy, then you may not use the hulu services.**

please note that the website addresses (i.e., urls) included within this
privacy policy may not function as hyperlinks on all the access points. [CLS] [SEP] to
view this privacy policy with clickable hyperlinks, please visit the hulu site
on your computer. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect

hulu may collect the following information from or about you, including
personal information, from the following sources:

information you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP] for
instance, when you register to use the hulu services, we may collect
identifiers and personal information including your name, email address,
credit card or other payment method information, address, zip code,
characteristics such as your age (birth date) and gender, and other
information. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, hulu may collect similar information you provide to
us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact hulu through
customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in
promotions or events. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect information you provide as part of
selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and
commercial information, such as the hulu plan(s) you purchase. [CLS] [SEP] hulu allows
multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect
information you provide to us if you create a profile. [CLS] [SEP]

usage, technical and log data. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information when you use the hulu
services or interact with hulu, including when you view hulu advertising
outside of the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP] we may collect information from and about the
browser or device you’re using and information about your internet or other
electronic network activity, including through analytics tools and the
technologies described below (“data collected through cookies and similar
technologies”). [CLS] [SEP] this information may include your ip address, device type,
browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system),
geolocation data (which may include precise location data), referral urls,
network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as
advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-id” or “idfa”) and identifiers associated
with browser cookies (see our description of “cookies and local storage”
below), and carrier information. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information about your
activity on the hulu services including information about the content you view
on hulu such as series titles and episode names (“viewing information”), page
views, and ads you have viewed on hulu. [CLS] [SEP]

data collected through cookies and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] like many online
services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store
preferences. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies are discussed below. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _cookies and local storage._ a cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. [CLS] [SEP] we may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the hulu services or hulu advertising published outside of the hulu services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the hulu services, and to customize content and advertising. [CLS] [SEP] these uses allow us to improve the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP] we may create a unique device or user id for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences. [CLS] [SEP] 

we may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred
to as “flash cookies”) and html5 local storage, including in connection with
features such as volume/mute settings for the video player. [CLS] [SEP] because these
technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called
“browser cookies,” even though they may be stored in different parts of your
computer. [CLS] [SEP]

you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting
cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
visit. [CLS] [SEP] for information about disabling cookies or deleting information
contained in flash cookies, please click [here](//helpx.adobe.com/flash-
player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html). [CLS] [SEP] please note that disabling
cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or flash cookies may
interfere with the performance and features of the hulu services, including
not being able to store your preferences or login information. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _web beacons, pixels and mobile sdks._ in addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the content, the ip address of your computer, and the url of the web page from which the content was viewed. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile software development kits (“sdks”) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-id” or “idfa”) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP] 

the use of these various technologies in connection with advertising on the
hulu services is explained further below. [CLS] [SEP] to learn about opting out of
interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we
have provided in section 6 (“your controls and choices, including opt-out
options”). [CLS] [SEP]

account and profile data from third-party services. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to log-in,
access or otherwise connect to the hulu services, or contact hulu through a
third-party service, we may, for example, collect identifiers including your
user id and user name associated with that service, as well as any information
you make public using that service. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect information you have
authorized the service to share with us (such as your user id, billing
information, public profile information, email address, birthday, pages you
have “liked” and other account and profile data). [CLS] [SEP]

information from partners and other sources. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information from
companies through which you may access or interact with the hulu services
(e.g., distribution partners, including device partners and voice assistant
platforms) or through which you pay for the hulu services or otherwise receive
access to the hulu services as part of your relationship with such company
(e.g., mobile phone carriers or other companies that provide services to you). [CLS] [SEP]
the information we collect from these partners may include email address and
other identifiers that support authentication, activation, and personalization
of the hulu services, as well as payment processing and other billing-related
matters. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect information about you from other sources,
including service providers (e.g., data licensors, research and analytics
companies, and payment processors), public databases, our marketing partners,
and advertisers. [CLS] [SEP] this may include information (whether identifiable, de-
identified or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your
interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online
(such as websites visited and advertisements viewed). [CLS] [SEP]

we may use the information we collect from or about you to better understand
your preferences and behaviors, including to customize content and advertising
for you. [CLS] [SEP] we may combine the information we collect from or about you and use
it in the manner described in this privacy policy or as otherwise permitted by
law. [CLS] [SEP]

[back to top]( #privacytitle)

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] use of information we collect

use in general. [CLS] [SEP] we use the information we collect from or about you in order
to help deliver a first-class user experience, including for the following
purposes:

  * providing the hulu services, including customer support;
  * contacting and communicating with you, including for promotions, updates, and notifications;
  * customizing the content and advertising you view and evaluating how well the content and advertising perform;
  * identifying content you share;
  * administering surveys, sweepstakes, contests, and other promotional activities or events;
  * customizing recommendations;
  * operating and optimizing the hulu services, such as by conducting analytics and research;
  * compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes;
  * detecting security incidents, preventing potentially fraudulent, illegal or harmful activities and otherwise enforcing our terms of use and other policies;
  * protecting your and our rights and complying with legal obligations;
  * other uses in accordance with our terms of use; and
  * any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or that is related to a request made by you. [CLS] [SEP]

use of payment information. [CLS] [SEP] we use payment information, such as credit card
numbers and billing zip code, and commercial information, such as the hulu
plan(s) you purchase, to help provide the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use
payment information to process payments from a subscriber (we use a third-
party payment processor to do this), to retrieve account information for a
subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and
to detect abuse of the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP]

use of precise location data. [CLS] [SEP] in order to access certain hulu services from
your computer or mobile device, you may be required to share your device’s
precise location data (e.g., latitude and longitude) with us. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to
providing you with certain hulu services, this also enables us to serve you
content related to your local area such as news and sports, depending on your
subscription. [CLS] [SEP] this data may also be used to tailor advertising to you based on
your location. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about your choices with respect to our collection
and use of precise location data, please see the information we have provided
in section 6 (“your controls and choices, including opt-out options”). [CLS] [SEP]

use of aggregate or de-identified information. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to the individual
data use described in this privacy policy, we may aggregate information about
you and other individuals together, or otherwise “de-identify” the information
about you (which means that the information does not directly or indirectly
identify you). [CLS] [SEP] we may use information in these forms for any legitimate
business purpose, including for research and analysis, administration of the
hulu services, advertising (e.g., improving our targeting efforts), and
promotional purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] sharing information with others

we may share information collected from or about you with others, including
business partners, social networking services, service providers, advertisers,
and other companies that are not affiliated with hulu, for the purposes
described below. [CLS] [SEP]

partners. [CLS] [SEP] we work with a number of business partners who help us offer the
hulu services, including, for example, our content programmers, distributors
and device partners, and corporate owners. [CLS] [SEP] we may share information collected
from or about you with such business partners, including email address,
viewing information, information about the ads you view on hulu and account or
device information (e.g., age, gender, device type, ip address, zip code,
advertising identifiers). [CLS] [SEP] this information may be shared for different
purposes depending on the partner, including for reporting and analytics,
activating, administering, and improving and personalizing your experience
with hulu or such partner, including by providing you with more tailored
content, features, and ads on hulu as well as on other platforms and services. [CLS] [SEP]
we may also engage with companies from time to time to provide you joint
promotional offers and opportunities and may share with these companies data
you provide or that is collected in connection with those offers (e.g., name
and mailing address to fulfill a giveaway). [CLS] [SEP]

service providers. [CLS] [SEP] we may share information collected from or about you with
companies that provide services to us, our business partners, and advertisers,
including companies that assist with payment processing, analytics, data
processing and management (e.g., to facilitate our targeted advertising and
marketing efforts), account management, hosting, customer and technical
support, marketing, advertising , measurement, and other services. [CLS] [SEP] the
categories of information that we share with service providers will vary
depending on the types of services they provide. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we share payment
information with our third-party payment processor to assist us in our billing
efforts, email addresses with our marketing service providers to assist with
our email campaigns, and ip address, hashed emails, and advertising
identifiers with service providers to assist in our advertising and marketing
efforts. [CLS] [SEP]

audience measurement providers. [CLS] [SEP] our business partners, such as content
programmers, as well as our advertisers, seek to measure the performance of
their creative material across many platforms, including the hulu services. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, hulu may permit the use of third-party measurement software that
enables third parties (such as nielsen) to use information collected from or
about you (e.g., viewing information, ad exposure data, ip address,
advertising identifiers) to include your viewing on the hulu services in
calculating measurement statistics such as tv ratings. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about
your choices with respect to nielsen measurement software, please see the
information we have provided in section 6 (“your controls and choices,
including opt-out options”). [CLS] [SEP]

advertisers. [CLS] [SEP] we display advertisements from other companies on the hulu
services, often enabling users to interact with the advertisements or click
through to websites or other properties owned or operated by other companies. [CLS] [SEP]
these advertisers and their service providers may use cookies and similar
technologies to collect information, from or about you through the hulu
services in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness,
and enable other enhancements. [CLS] [SEP] this information may relate to your use of the
hulu services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other
activities online and may include the information described in section 2
(“information we collect”). [CLS] [SEP] we may also compile and provide reports, including
in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to advertisers about the
effectiveness of their campaigns. [CLS] [SEP]

third parties when required by law or when necessary to protect your or our
rights. [CLS] [SEP] in some instances, we may disclose information from or about you
without providing you a choice. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may disclose your information
in the following ways: to protect the legal rights of hulu and our affiliates
or partners; to protect the safety and security of users of the hulu services
or third parties; to enforce our terms of use; to protect against fraud; and
to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for
cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. [CLS] [SEP]

third parties in connection with certain transactions. [CLS] [SEP] if we sell all or part
of our business, make a transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in
a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may
transfer information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of
the transaction, including the due diligence process. [CLS] [SEP]

parties with your consent or when you otherwise choose to share. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
share information from or about you with any party when we have your consent
or when you otherwise choose to share such information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, certain
functions within the hulu services may give you the option to share
information about your activities on the hulu services, for example, by email,
text message, social networking services, or other sharing function. [CLS] [SEP] in
addition, you may have the option to choose to share information with our
advertisers or other partners through an interactive ad unit. [CLS] [SEP] information you
share through third party platforms and with social networks, advertisers, and
other third parties is subject to their terms of use and privacy policies
which we recommend you review. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] sharing what you watch

we may ask for your consent to hulu sharing viewing information together with
certain personal information that we may collect (such as your name, address,
email address, and precise location data) with our content programmers,
service providers, and other third parties set forth in section 4 (“sharing
information with others”). [CLS] [SEP] this information may help hulu or these companies
personalize your experience by providing you with more tailored content,
features, and ads on hulu as well as on other platforms and services. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that we request consent on a per-profile basis (i.e., for each profile)
and therefore the consent provided for one profile does not apply to the
consent of any other profile associated with the account. [CLS] [SEP] to learn how to view
or change your consent preference, please see the information we have provided
in section 6 (“your controls and choices, including opt-out options”). [CLS] [SEP] for
clarity, even if you have not consented to hulu sharing viewing information
together with your personal information, we may still share information
collected from or about you as otherwise permitted in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we may still share viewing information together with account or
device information (e.g., ip address, zip code, advertising identifiers). [CLS] [SEP]

nielsen digital ad ratings ("dar") when you stream hulu on your television
through streaming media players, smart tvs, chromecast, blu-ray players,
gaming consoles, and similar devices. [CLS] [SEP] nielsen dar on these devices allows
nielsen to measure the performance of ad campaigns viewed by our registered

[CLS] [SEP] please note that your opt-out choices will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * there is currently no consensus among industry participants as to what “do not track” means and how to respond to “do not track” browser signals.

opt-out from collection of precise location data from your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you
can opt out of our collection of precise location data from your mobile device

the security of your information is important to us. [CLS] [SEP] we use a variety of
physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in
