our services. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information about you where you are an
individual representative of one of our business partners or providers with
whom we engage in offering and providing our services. [CLS] [SEP]

the information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how
you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### personal information we collect and use if you register to use, or use,
one of our websites or services (including for trial purposes)

information on this and our [cookies policy](../cookies.html). [CLS] [SEP]

we process mail sent and received from your account to block spam and fraud. [CLS] [SEP]
we receive information from third party services to assist us in identifying
spam. [CLS] [SEP] if you report a message to us, either through the service or via
customer support, as spam or not spam, we may share that message with the
third party service that flagged it to improve the accuracy of future
filtering. [CLS] [SEP] see further below on your rights when we disclose your information

each time you connect to our service, we log your ip address, your client
identifier (browser or mail client information) and your username. [CLS] [SEP] if you send

address you're sending to. [CLS] [SEP] if you take action on mail in your mailbox, we also
log the activities taken. [CLS] [SEP] this is necessary for providing proof of delivery
and fraud analysis. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we need this information for detecting
deliverability issues if there are failures sending email that we either
detect through monitoring or when you ask if email you are sending/receiving
is working properly. [CLS] [SEP] we also need your ip address and username to help you
validate if someone else has gained access to your account to send spam or for
other fraudulent purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

### how we use personal information to keep you up to date with our products
and services

we may use your name and email address to send direct marketing communications
to you and let you know more about our services or related services that we
believe will be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] we may contact you by email, or through
other communication channels that we think you may find helpful. [CLS] [SEP] in all cases,
we will respect your preferences for how you would like us to manage marketing
activity with you. [CLS] [SEP]

### how you can manage your marketing preferences

to protect your privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we
manage marketing with you:

  * users of the fastmail, listbox and pobox services can opt out of any non-essential communication by de-selecting the relevant checkbox in the settings page in the web interface;
  * even after opting in, you can ask us to stop sending email marketing by following the âunsubscribeâ or opt-out links in electronic communications. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively you can [contact us](https://www.fastmail.com/about/privacy/#contact); and
  * we will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you

### when and how we undertake data analytics and profiling

we use matomo, a web analysis service of innocraft inc. [CLS] [SEP] (âmatomoâ). [CLS] [SEP] matomo
uses cookies to monitor traffic to, and use of our marketing websites only. [CLS] [SEP]
there is no matomo tracking once you are logged in. [CLS] [SEP] information about the use
of our website generated by these cookies is generally transferred to a matomo
server in the usa and stored there. [CLS] [SEP] matomo uses this information on our behalf
to evaluate usage of our website, and to compile reports on activities. [CLS] [SEP] all
personal information, including ip addresses, are anonymised by them. [CLS] [SEP] matomo
respects do not track browser flags; you may opt out of tracking by setting
your browser to do not track. [CLS] [SEP]

we use usefathom, a web anaylsis service of conva ventures inc. [CLS] [SEP]
(âfathomâ). [CLS] [SEP] fathom does not use cookies or store any personally
identifiable information on their servers. [CLS] [SEP] fathom is only used on our
marketing websites, there is no fathom tracking once you are logged in. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to assess if your
account may be fraudulent, a spam account or suspect in any way. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
use profiling to lock fraudulent or suspect accounts, including any âstolen
accountsâ. [CLS] [SEP] our monitoring systems detect high levels of outgoing spam, or
unusual login patterns which a staff member then reviews to determine
appropriate action. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not profile you to customise services for you, provide personalised
content or show you personalised advertisements based on your individual
interests, preferences, or related activities. [CLS] [SEP]

## transferring personal information globally

in this section you can find out more about:

  * how we operate as a global business and transfer data internationally; and
  * the arrangements we have in place to protect your personal information if we transfer it overseas. [CLS] [SEP]

your personal information may be disclosed, transferred to or processed
outside of your country of residence. [CLS] [SEP] this includes to australia, the united
states of america, india, and the netherlands, where it will be subject to the
laws of the country to which it is transferred. [CLS] [SEP] these jurisdictions may not
have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your country. [CLS] [SEP]

for eu/uk individuals â if you are an individual based in or a resident of
the european union or the united kingdom, your personal information may be
processed outside of the european union, in countries such as the united
states of america, australia, india, that are subject to different standards
of data protection. [CLS] [SEP]

we will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal
information are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to
protect your privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to
countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal
protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in
place to protect your privacy rights. [CLS] [SEP] to this end:

  * where we transfer your personal information outside of fastmail or to third parties who help provide our services, we obtain contractual commitments from those third parties to protect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] some of these assurances are well-recognised certification schemes like the eu us privacy shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the eu to the united states and/or the use of eu approached standard contractual clauses ( **âeu model clausesâ** ) for controller to controller and /or controller to processor transfers from the eu/uk to jurisdictions, such as australia who do not have an adequacy finding from the eu commission; or
  * where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information is disclosed. [CLS] [SEP]

you have a right to [contact
us](https://www.fastmail.com/about/privacy/#contact) for more information
about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant
contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal
information when this is transferred as mentioned above. [CLS] [SEP]

## how we protect and store your information

### security

we store most of your personal information electronically. [CLS] [SEP] we implement and
maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies
and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss,
misuse or interference or the unauthorised disclosure, access or modification
to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned. [CLS] [SEP]

the security of your information is paramount and a critical consideration for
fastmail in the provision of its services to you. [CLS] [SEP] please see further
information on the [security measures](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-
us/articles/1500000280221) we engage on our websites and platform and when you
use any of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

we work hard to protect you and fastmail from unauthorised access, alteration,
disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. [CLS] [SEP] measures we take include:

  * placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to provide our services to you;
  * destroying your personal information if it is no longer needed to provide you with our service;
  * destroying logging or other transactional information that may incidentally contain personal information in accordance with our schedules to clear such information;
  * following strict security procedures in the access, storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it; and
  * using secure communication transmission software (known as "secure sockets layer" or "ssl") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us. [CLS] [SEP] ssl is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception. [CLS] [SEP]

as the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer
and/or device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to
protect your user ids and passwords, please take appropriate measures to
protect this information. [CLS] [SEP]

### how long do we store/retain your personal information

we will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary
for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP] where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is
disposed of in a secure manner. [CLS] [SEP]

in some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer
periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance
with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. [CLS] [SEP] where we log information
related to your ip address, we retain this information for approximately 90
days. [CLS] [SEP] this is for the purposes of fraud watch, as often users donât check in
with us in a timely fashion over whether their account is compromised. [CLS] [SEP] being
able to look at some amount of recent history and know what activity was taken
by a legitimate user vs a malicious one is useful. [CLS] [SEP]

we proscribe your primary email address, if itâs at one of our domains, for
up to 6 six months after your account is closed, to reduce the risk of
impersonation, should someone try to use the same email address as you in
order to impersonate you. [CLS] [SEP]

where you request that we delete your account from our system, we will
immediately lock the account and archive the information, then delete it from
our severs within approximately 7 days from the date of your request. [CLS] [SEP] this
archive window allows you to recover your information in the event of an
accident or malicious deletion request. [CLS] [SEP]

however, in specific limited circumstances we may store your personal
information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of
your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we
reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal
information or dealings. [CLS] [SEP]

### children's data

when a fastmail product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction
under which parental consent or authorisation is required to use the product,
the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide
consent or authorisation from a parent or guardian before they can use it. [CLS] [SEP] we
will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is
necessary to provide the product. [CLS] [SEP]

## cookies

we may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it
would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are
legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way. [CLS] [SEP]
