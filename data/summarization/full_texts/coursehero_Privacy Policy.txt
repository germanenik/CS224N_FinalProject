we may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including
third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms,
to serve advertisements through the services. [CLS] [SEP] these advertisements may be
targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display
certain preferences or behaviors (“interest-based ads”). [CLS] [SEP] information for
interest-based ads (including personal data) may be provided to us by you, or
derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the services and/or

deliver cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network

records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet
or storing data is completely secure. [CLS] [SEP]
