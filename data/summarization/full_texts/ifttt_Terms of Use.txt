user trust is core to the ifttt experience. [CLS] [SEP] people trust us to get their
services and devices talking with each other in a reliable way. [CLS] [SEP]

we’re excited that the european general data protection regulation (gdpr)
brought privacy and trust into the limelight. [CLS] [SEP] the gdpr created specific rights
for european citizens with respect to their data. [CLS] [SEP] that’s great. [CLS] [SEP] but at ifttt,
we believe everyone should have more control over their data. [CLS] [SEP] so we’ve built
new controls to allow all ifttt users to interact in new ways with their data
directly from our website and mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP]

we’ll continue to add features that give you even more control over your data. [CLS] [SEP]

## take your data anywhere

![export your ifttt data in a machine readable format.](//web-
assets.ifttt.com/assets/web/settings/control-your-
data-29a991de1ba1bac176126c9740282e30d3ee316a180a749df48c66432635d064.svg)

your data on ifttt is yours. [CLS] [SEP] you should be able to take it anywhere in a
machine readable format and tinker with it. [CLS] [SEP]

you will now be able to [export your ifttt data](/settings#control-your-data
"export your ifttt data") directly from your user profile on our website and
mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP] once you’ve clicked “export” we will email you a json file with
your ifttt data. [CLS] [SEP]

## delete your account

our goal is to make it as simple as possible for you to control your data on
ifttt. [CLS] [SEP]

we’d love to provide useful functionality to you forever. [CLS] [SEP] but if ifttt stops
being useful to you, we’ll be sad to see you go, but we won’t hoard your data. [CLS] [SEP]

want to delete your data from ifttt? no problem. [CLS] [SEP] simply click the [“delete my
account” link](/settings#control-your-data "“delete my account” link") in your
profile. [CLS] [SEP] you will always be welcome back!

## transparency

to fully control your data, you need to know how it’s being used. [CLS] [SEP] we’re
updating our privacy policy and terms of use to provide more granular
information about how we use data. [CLS] [SEP]

every service is different. [CLS] [SEP] meaningful transparency will mean different things
depending on each service. [CLS] [SEP] you will get a relevant just-in-time notice every
time you connect a new service to ifttt to use for a specific applet. [CLS] [SEP] the
authentication flow will tell you which data is used from your account and the
applet description tells you how that data will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

we’ll continue to think about other ways to provide meaningful transparency to
you. [CLS] [SEP] stay tuned!

# privacy policy

as of july 20th, 2018

ifttt inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("ifttt") takes the private nature of your personal information
very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy describes how we treat the information we
collect when you visit and use the ifttt website located at ifttt.com (the
"site") and the services offered by ifttt (the site, mobile apps, and services
referred to as the "service"). [CLS] [SEP] please read this privacy policy to learn more
about the ways in which ifttt uses and protects your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] by
using the service you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the terms, please do
not use the service or access our site. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
the ifttt service is not intended for use by children. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 18,
you may use the service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the
age of 16. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the
services or send any personal information about yourself to us. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn
that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will
delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that a child
under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at
[privacy@ifttt.com](mailto:privacy@ifttt.com). [CLS] [SEP]

###### information we collect automatically

browsing the site does not require you to register for an account or provide
any personal information to us. [CLS] [SEP] in general, ifttt will gather some generic
information automatically. [CLS] [SEP] this generic information may include the internet
address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the
site, the url that you just came from (whether this url is on the site or
not), which url you next go to (whether this url is on the site or not), and
your computer browser information. [CLS] [SEP] generic information does not reveal the
identity of the visitor. [CLS] [SEP] this type of aggregate data may enable us to figure
out how often users use parts of the service, help us determine customer
service and site needs, and do internal research on our users' demographics,
interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our
community. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. [CLS] [SEP]
as part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not
information about you personally, to our partners about how our users,
collectively, use our service. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we use analytics to help analyze how our users use the services. [CLS] [SEP] google
analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users
visit the services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used
prior to coming to the services. [CLS] [SEP] we may use the information we get from google
analytics to improve our services or to send you promotional messages about
our services. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics collects the ip address assigned to you on the
date you visit the services, but not your name or other personally identifying
information. [CLS] [SEP] we do not combine the information generated through the use of
google analytics with any personally identifying information. [CLS] [SEP] although google
analytics plants a persistent cookie to identify you as a unique user the next
time you visit the service, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but google. [CLS] [SEP]
google’s ability to use and share information collected by google analytics
about your visits to the service is restricted by the google analytics terms
of use and the google privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] you may find additional information
about google analytics at
[http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). [CLS] [SEP]

###### information collected from other websites and do not track policy

through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information
about your online activity after you leave our service. [CLS] [SEP] just like any other
usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the
service and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] your browser may offer you a “do not track” option, which
allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and
services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such
operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across
different websites. [CLS] [SEP] our service does not support do not track requests at this
time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both
while you are using the service and after you leave our service. [CLS] [SEP]

###### information you provide to us

we receive and store any information you enter on the service or provide to us
in any other way. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose not to provide us with certain information,
though you may not be able to take advantage of many service features. [CLS] [SEP] the
personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding
to your questions or requests, customizing the content you see, and
communicating with you about new service features. [CLS] [SEP] if you send us personal
correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties
send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the service, we
may collect such information into a file specific to you. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we
may use your personal information to contact you as provided herein, though
our intent is that email is the only channel we will use to contact you
without your consent. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
also, once you install any mobile apps and enable specific platform services,
you may be providing us with additional information, such as contacts and
camera-photos on your device. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we may collect information about
your location and calendar in order to provide you with more personalized
service. [CLS] [SEP] again, you can choose not to provide us with certain information,
though you may not be able to take advantage of many service features. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
if you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in
to the services through a third party site or platform service, you understand
some content and/or information in those accounts (“third party account
information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize
such transmissions, and that third party account information transmitted to
our services is covered by this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
one such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit
third party account information to your services profile or to automatically
transmit information in your services profile to your third party account. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
in order for you to take full advantage of the service, you must provide
registration information, including an e-mail address and password. [CLS] [SEP] we may
also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to
provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is
optional. [CLS] [SEP] once you register for the service, create applets, and/or give us
your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. [CLS] [SEP] usernames and links to
public accounts are only shown on your profile with your consent. [CLS] [SEP] you always
have the option to not provide information by choosing not to register for the
service or create any applets. [CLS] [SEP] our primary purpose in collecting personal
information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience. [CLS] [SEP]
we only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for
achieving this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt does not sell or rent your personal information
to third parties without your explicit consent. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt may disclose information
it has collected from you and/or that you have made available through the
service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires
it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of
ifttt or others. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for managing the flow of your private
information from one third party platform service to another. [CLS] [SEP] if you post
personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information
becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and
redistributed through the internet and other media channels. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if
you push a private post on facebook to a public blog, the private post will no
longer be private. [CLS] [SEP] you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in
return. [CLS] [SEP]

###### is my information secure?

we treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized
access. [CLS] [SEP] we use industry-standard secure socket layer (ssl) software to protect
the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts
all of the information you input. [CLS] [SEP] all personal information collected from
other platform services that you provide through the use of the service is
stored securely. [CLS] [SEP] only employees who need personal information to perform a
specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted
access to it. [CLS] [SEP] all of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and
security practices. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed
in ways not otherwise described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] by way of example, we
may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third
parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept
or access transmissions or private communications. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and
to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared
computer. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all actions taken with your user id and
password. [CLS] [SEP] therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to share your user id and password or your
personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions
taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding
actions taken on your behalf such as if someone used your user and id password
to forward libelous material through the service. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, if your password
has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
password. [CLS] [SEP]

###### what about cookies?

when you visit the site, we may send one or more "cookies" to your computer
hard drive through your web browser. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie is a small file containing a
string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that
the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. [CLS] [SEP]
any use of cookies by us will be solely for the purposes of improving the
quality of access to the site by storing user preferences, and tracking user
trends, such as how people use the site, and their site access preferences. [CLS] [SEP]
cookies tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many
people. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less
frequently. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent ifttt uses cookies, such cookies do not collect
personal information, and we do not combine information collected through
cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your
username or e-mail address is. [CLS] [SEP] you are always free to decline our cookies if
your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain
features on the site and you may be required to reenter your password or login
information more frequently. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt visitors who do not wish to have cookies
placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
using the site. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you
can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however,
because deleting cookies may reduce the functionality of ifttt. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
control the use of cookies by third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

###### will ifttt share any of the information it receives with other
entities?

we may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or
more aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your
personal information directly to these service providers. [CLS] [SEP] these service
providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal
restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for
any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced ifttt related
operation, unless you have given your prior permission to them for additional
uses. [CLS] [SEP] we may share our data, including personal information about you with our
partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent that
these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as
protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. [CLS] [SEP] our
partners and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all
users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. [CLS] [SEP] in these
types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business
assets that is transferred. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
moreover, if ifttt, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in
the unlikely event that ifttt goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or
acquired by a third party. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
that any acquirer of ifttt may continue to use your personal information as
set forth in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as
well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]
therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other
government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal
activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state,
telephone number, and email address. [CLS] [SEP] we will not otherwise disclose your
personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without
a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when
we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to
prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal
activity. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy applies to the ifttt service only. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our site. [CLS] [SEP]
these other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
collect data or solicit personal information from you. [CLS] [SEP] since ifttt does not
control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy
policies of that third party. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to ask questions before you
disclose your personal information to others. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we may de-identify your personal information so that you are not identified as
an individual, and provide that information to our partners. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to
collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand
how often and in what ways people use our services, so that they, too, can
provide you with an optimal online experience. [CLS] [SEP] however, we never disclose
aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner
to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an
individual person. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information
may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing
of this information. [CLS] [SEP]

###### accessing, reviewing and changing your personal information

services can be disconnected at anytime though prior applets may remain in our
electronic archive. [CLS] [SEP] you can change your email address and contact information
by going to the settings page. [CLS] [SEP] you must promptly update your personal
information if it changes or is inaccurate. [CLS] [SEP] you may be able to add or update
certain additional information via the service. [CLS] [SEP] when you update information,
however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. [CLS] [SEP]
please note that information may remain in our records after deletion of your
account. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt will only update your information on third party sites or send
you information (phone, sms, etc.) with your specific consent, such as when
you add applets to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

###### user communications

you may input your contact information into the service so that ifttt may
contact you. [CLS] [SEP] when you enter your contact information or send an email or other
communication to ifttt, we may retain those communications in order to process
your inquiries and respond to your requests. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use your email address
or contact information to send commercial or marketing messages nor do we give
or sell this information to any third parties. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent your e-mail
address is provided to ifttt, you may receive e-mail or other communications
from us. [CLS] [SEP]

###### your california privacy rights

under california civil code sections 1798.83-1798.84, california residents are
entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal
information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for
marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates
and/or third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california resident and would like a copy
of this notice, please submit a written request to:
[privacy@ifttt.com](mailto:privacy@ifttt.com) or ifttt inc., po box 590547,
san francisco, ca 94159-0547, attn: legal

###### changes to this policy

please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] we will not
reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent, and we
expect most such changes will be minor. [CLS] [SEP] regardless, we will post any policy
changes on this page. [CLS] [SEP] we may amend this privacy policy at any time by posting
the amend terms on the site. [CLS] [SEP] all amended terms shall automatically be
effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the site. [CLS] [SEP] each
version of this policy will be identified at the top of the page by its
effective date. [CLS] [SEP]

# eu residents

if you are a resident of the european union (“eu”), united kingdom,
lichtenstein, norway, or iceland, you may have additional rights under the eu
general data protection regulation (the “gdpr”) with respect to your personal
data, as outlined below. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
for this section, we use the terms “personal data” and “processing” as they
are defined in the gdpr, but “personal data” generally means information that
can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally
covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as
collection, use, storage and disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt will be the controller of your
personal data processed in connection with the service. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
if there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of
this privacy policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of personal
data shall control to the extent of such conflict. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions
about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please
contact us at [ifttt@gdpr-rep.com](mailto:ifttt@gdpr-rep.com). [CLS] [SEP]

###### what personal data do we collect from you?

we collect personal data about you when you provide such information directly
to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers
provide us with personal data about you, or when personal data about you is
automatically collected in connection with your use of our service. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
information we receive directly from you: we receive personal data directly
from you when you provide us with such personal data, including without
limitation the following:

  * first and last name
  * email address
  * mailing address
  * telephone number
  * transaction information (ifttt does not store your credit or debit card information)
  * user content, for example, action ingredients that are displayed when an applet runs

information we receive from third party sources includes applet trigger
fields, ingredients, and action fields. [CLS] [SEP] this data is unique to your use of
ifttt and can be found on the applet configuration panel for any of your
applets: <https://ifttt.com/my_applets>. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
some third parties, such as our business partners and service providers,
provide us with personal data about you, such as the following:

  * account information for third party platform services: if you interact with a third party platform service when using our service, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our service (e.g., facebook login or google sign-in), or if you share content from our service through a third party social media platform service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. [CLS] [SEP] the information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * information from our advertising partners: we receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * information we automatically collect when you use our service: some personal data is automatically collected when you use our service, such as the following:

    * location information (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] ip address, zip code)
    * log data (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] access times, hardware and software information)

###### how do we use your personal data?

we process personal data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our
service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use personal data to:

  * create and manage user profiles
  * communicate with you about the service
  * process orders
  * contact you about service announcements, updates or offers
  * provide support and assistance for the service
  * personalize website content and communications based on your preferences
  * meet contract or legal obligations
  * respond to user inquiries
  * fulfill user requests
  * comply with our legal or contractual obligations
  * resolve disputes
  * protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions
  * enforce our terms of service

we will only process your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing
so. [CLS] [SEP] lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our
“legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further
described below. [CLS] [SEP]

  * contractual necessity: we process the following categories of personal data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our terms of use with you, which enables us to provide you with the service. [CLS] [SEP] when we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the service that require such data. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * legitimate interest: we process the following categories of personal data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties. [CLS] [SEP] examples of these legitimate interests include: 
    * operation and improvement of our business, products and services
    * marketing of our products and services
    * provision of customer support
    * protection from fraud or security threats
    * compliance with legal obligations
    * completion of corporate transactions
  

  * consent: in some cases, we process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. [CLS] [SEP] when we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection. [CLS] [SEP] 
  

  * other processing grounds: from time to time we may also need to process personal data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. [CLS] [SEP] 

###### how and with whom do we share your data?

we share personal data with vendors, third party service providers and agents
who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes
described in this privacy policy or our terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] these parties
include:

  * payment processors
  * fraud prevention service providers
  * ad networks
  * analytics service providers
  * staff augmentation and contract personnel
  * hosting service providers
  * co-location service providers
  * telecommunications service providers

we also share personal data when necessary to complete a transaction initiated
or authorized by you or provide you with a product or service you have
requested. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to those set forth above, these parties also include:

  * other users (where you post information publicly or as otherwise necessary to effect a transaction initiated or authorized by you through the service) 
  * social media services (if you interact with them through your use of the service)
  * third party business partners who you access through the service
  * other parties authorized by you

we also share personal data when we believe it is necessary to:

  * comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies
  * maintain the security of our products and services

we also share information with third parties when you give us consent to do
so. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
last, we share personal data with our affiliates or other members of our
corporate family. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user
information is typically one of the transferred business assets. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, if
we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of
business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share personal data
with the party that is acquiring our assets. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that such
transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to
use your personal information as set forth in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

###### how long do we retain your personal data?

we retain personal data about you for as long as you have an open account with
us or as otherwise necessary to provide you service. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases we retain
personal data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted
or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. [CLS] [SEP] afterwards, we retain some
information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would
identify you personally. [CLS] [SEP]

###### what security measures do we use?

we seek to protect personal data using appropriate technical and
organizational measures based on the type of personal data and applicable
processing activity. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
personal data of children: we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal

# terms of use

as of september 8, 2020

please read these terms carefully before using the services offered by ifttt
inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("ifttt"). [CLS] [SEP] by using the website ifttt.com or other features, services,
products, or applications offered by ifttt (collectively, the "service"), you
(hereafter “user” or “you”) agree to be bound by these terms of use (the
"terms"). [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t agree with these new terms, you are free to reject them;
unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the service. [CLS] [SEP] if
you use the service in any way after a change to the terms is effective, that
means you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP] except for changes by us as described
here, no other amendment or modification of these terms will be effective
unless in writing and signed by both you and us. [CLS] [SEP]

the individual who accepts these terms and conditions, must be of a legal age
to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or
guardian’s permission to use the service and gotten your parent or guardian to
agree to these terms on your behalf). [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re agreeing to these terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you
represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these terms on that
organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these terms (in which case,
the references to “you” and “your” in these terms, except for in this
sentence, refer to that organization or entity). [CLS] [SEP] you hereby certify you are
legally permitted to use the service, and take full responsibility for the
selection, access, and use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access and use
the service is revoked in such jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP]

we are constantly trying to improve our service, so these terms may need to
change along with the service. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change the terms at any
time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on
ifttt.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] the service

###### what are the basics of using the service?

you may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user
name (“ifttt user id”). [CLS] [SEP] as a condition to using the service or in order to
create certain statements through the service, you may be required to supply
ifttt with certain registration information, including a valid email address,
registration information for mobile phones, other mobile devices, or third-
party sites or services you access through ifttt. [CLS] [SEP]

you promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration
information about yourself. [CLS] [SEP] you may not (i) select or use as your username a
name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use
as your username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you
without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as your username a name that
is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt reserves the right to refuse
registration of, or cancel a username in its discretion. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not use
another user's account or any other person's registration information for the
service, any other mobile phones or other mobile devices, or any third party
services you access through the service, without that person's permission. [CLS] [SEP]

your right to use the service continues until it is terminated by either
party. [CLS] [SEP] you may terminate by discontinuing use of the service. [CLS] [SEP] ifttt may
terminate at any time for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] your use terminates automatically if (i)
you violate any term of these terms, (ii) ifttt publicly posts a written
notice of termination on the service, (iii) ifttt sends a written notice of
termination to you, or (iv) ifttt ceases providing access to the service to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

ifttt will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the service is available
twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. [CLS] [SEP] however, there will be occasions
when the service will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and emergency
repairs. [CLS] [SEP] every reasonable step will be taken by ifttt to minimize such
disruption where it is within ifttt's reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that ifttt
will not be liable in any event to you or any other party for any suspension,
modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

you shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or
ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the service,
including, without limitation, mobile phones, modems, hardware, software, data
plans, and long distance or local telephone service. [CLS] [SEP] you shall be responsible
for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

foregoing, the “content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual
property laws. [CLS] [SEP] you promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules,
information, and restrictions contained in any content you access through the
service, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish,
broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or
otherwise exploit for any purpose any content not owned by you, (i) without
the prior consent of the owner of that content or (ii) in a way that violates
someone else’s (including ifttt’s) rights. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand that ifttt owns the service. [CLS] [SEP] you won’t (except as permitted by
applicable law) reverse engineer, modify, or create derivative works based on
the service. [CLS] [SEP]

the service may allow you to copy or download certain content; please remember
that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the
restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

###### what if i see something on the service that infringes my copyright?

you may have heard of the digital millennium copyright act (the “dmca”), as it
relates to online service providers, like ifttt, being asked to remove
material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. [CLS] [SEP] we respect others’
intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable
content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat
alleged infringers; to review our complete copyright dispute policy and learn
how to report potentially infringing content, [click

###### who is responsible for what i see and do on the service?

any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through
the service is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such
information or content originated, and you access all such information or
content at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that
information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in
connection with it. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot control and have no duty to take any action
regarding how you may interpret and use the information or content or what
actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the information or
content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired
or not acquired information or content through the service. [CLS] [SEP] we can’t guarantee
the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the service and are
not responsible for which users gain access to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all content you contribute, in any manner, to the
service, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so,
in the manner in which you contribute it. [CLS] [SEP] you will keep all your registration
information accurate and current. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all your activity in
connection with the service. [CLS] [SEP]

the service may contain links or connections to third party websites or
services that are not owned or controlled by ifttt. [CLS] [SEP] when you access third
party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in
doing so, and that ifttt is not responsible for such risks. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you
to be aware when you leave the service and to read the terms and conditions
and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or
utilize. [CLS] [SEP]

ifttt has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third
party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the
service. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, ifttt will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or
edit the content of any third party site or service. [CLS] [SEP] by using the service, you
release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use
of any third party website or service. [CLS] [SEP]

your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through
the service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any
other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such
dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. [CLS] [SEP]
you should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate
before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that ifttt shall not be responsible or liable for any
loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. [CLS] [SEP]

if there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and
any third party, you agree that ifttt is under no obligation to become
involved. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users,
you release ifttt, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from
claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any
way related to such disputes and/or our service. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california
resident, you shall and hereby do waive california civil code section 1542,
which says: "a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing
the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his
or her settlement with the debtor."

###### will ifttt ever change the service?

we’re always trying to improve the service, so it may change over time. [CLS] [SEP] we may
suspend or discontinue any part of the service, or we may introduce new
features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or
all of the service. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll try to give you notice when we make a material
change to the service that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always
practical. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, we reserve the right to remove any content from the
service at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone
alleges you contributed that content in violation of these terms), in our sole
discretion, and without notice. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to our [privacy policy](https://ifttt.com/privacy) to the extent they
relate to user submissions that are also your personally-identifiable
information. [CLS] [SEP]

for all user submissions, you hereby grant ifttt a license to translate,
modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is
viewable on an iphone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act
with respect to such user submissions, in each case to enable us to operate
the service, as described in more detail below. [CLS] [SEP] **this is a license only –
your ownership in user submissions is not affected.**

if you store a user submission in your own personal ifttt account, in a manner
that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “personal user
submission”), you grant ifttt the license above, as well as a license to
display, perform, and distribute your personal user submission for the sole
purpose of making that personal user submission accessible to you and
providing the service necessary to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

if you share a user submission only in a manner that only certain specified
users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a
“limited audience user submission”), then you grant ifttt the licenses above,
as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your limited audience
user submission for the sole purpose of making that limited audience user
submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the service
necessary to do so. [CLS] [SEP] also, you grant such other specified users a license to

foregoing, a “public user submission”), then you grant ifttt the licenses
above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your public
user submission for the purpose of making that public user submission
accessible to all ifttt users and providing the service necessary to do so, as
well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that
public user submission in connection with the service and/or otherwise in
connection with ifttt’s business. [CLS] [SEP] also, you grant all other users of the
service a license to access that public user submission, and to use and
exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your
ifttt account, we will stop displaying your user submissions (other than
public user submissions, which may remain fully available) to other users (if
applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to
completely delete that content from ifttt’s records, and that your user
submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied
or stored by other users. [CLS] [SEP]

finally, you understand and agree that ifttt, in performing the required
technical steps to provide the service to our users (including you), may need
to make changes to your user submissions to conform and adapt those user

all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only united states (federal or

ifttt be liable to you for any amount. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow the
