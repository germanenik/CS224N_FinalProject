## shapeshift privacy policy

 _last modified: february 2021_

this privacy policy lists the data privacy practices and processes of
shapeshift global limited, a private limited company formed in the united
kingdom (âshapeshiftâ, âweâ, âourâ, or âusâ) and includes
detailed descriptions of the third-party services we utilize to collect and
process your data. [CLS] [SEP] protection and security of the data of our users is very
important to shapeshift and our affiliates, as is your trust in us and the
services we provide. [CLS] [SEP] shapeshift is committed to handling your data responsibly
and in compliance with all legal requirements. [CLS] [SEP] this policy describes how we
collect, process, transfer, and secure your personal data when you access and
use shapeshift.com, shapeshift.io, any of our mobile applications, or any
other product or service offered by shapeshift (â **services** â). [CLS] [SEP] all
other aspects of your interaction with our services are governed by our [terms
of service](https://shapeshift.com/terms-of-service) (â **terms** â). [CLS] [SEP] any
conflicts between this policy and the terms will be resolved in favor of this
policy. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **your acceptance of this policy  
** by accessing or using the services, are accepting all aspects of this
policy. [CLS] [SEP] if we require additional or direct consent from you to further process
your personal information, we will ask for your consent for the collection,
use, or disclosure of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we may provide additional
"just-in-time" disclosures or information about the data processing practices
of specific services. [CLS] [SEP] these notices may supplement or clarify our privacy
practices or may provide you with additional choices about how we process your
data. [CLS] [SEP] **if you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of
this policy, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
how we may change this policy**  
shapeshift, in its sole discretion, may modify or update this policy at any
time, so you should review this page periodically. [CLS] [SEP] if we update this policy,
the âlast modifiedâ date will list the month when such update(s) were
made. [CLS] [SEP] if we make any material changes to this policy, we notify our registered
users via email and summarize those changes. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of our
services after any change to this policy is deemed your acceptance of such
change(s). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **with whom we share your personal data  
** in connection with our services, to protect our legitimate interests, to
fulfill legal requirements, or to perform under agreements we enter into
(including our terms), we may be required to share your personal data with our
affiliate shapeshift us, inc., with our business partners (described in more
detail below), as well as with public authorities in connection with a
facially valid official law enforcement request. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, such sharing of
data may be necessary to manage your registration (such as to verify your
identity), to respond to your inquiries, to execute a transaction you request,
to provide access to additional information, or to inform you about new
services or offers. [CLS] [SEP] further, to the extent we are legally required by public
authorities or courts, we will share your personal data with them or other
third-parties. [CLS] [SEP] the data sharing may include transfers to companies or
organizations in countries without an adequate standard of data protection. [CLS] [SEP] in
these cases, we transfer personal data in accordance with applicable
provisions on the international transfer of personal data, such as, where
applicable, the respective provisions of the eu general data protection
regulation (â **gdpr** â). [CLS] [SEP] **by accessing our services, you expressly
allow us to export data outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside or are
located when you utilize the services.**  
 **  
** **data we collect and process in order to make the services generally
available  
** you can use some aspects of our services, including our websites, and
obtain information about our services without telling us who you are, however,
when accessing any website, a user makes a connection with a webserver, which
automatically logs and stores certain technical data including: that userâs
internet protocol address (â **ip address** â), the operating system of
that userâs device, the time the website was accessed, or the web browser
used to access the site. [CLS] [SEP] logging this data is required in order to make the
services available to you and other users and ensure the functionality of the
services. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent we, thereby, process such personal data, we do so
based on our legitimate interest to bring you the best possible user
experience and to safeguard the security and stability of our systems. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
similarly, our services use google fonts (previously known as google web
fonts), a library of open-source font families that enhance your browsing
experience, which are licensed by google llc (â **google** â). [CLS] [SEP] to
integrate google fonts into our websites, your browser establishes a
connection to googleâs server and the ip address of your device is
transmitted to google. [CLS] [SEP] google logs records of font queries and protects this
data from unauthorized access. [CLS] [SEP] google analyzes aggregated data to optimize
google fonts and identify which websites use google fonts. [CLS] [SEP] further information
on google fonts can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/) and information
on how google handles personal data can be found
[here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we use amazon web services (â **aws** â) to host all of our websites. [CLS] [SEP]
thus, any data collected by us on any of our websites will be stored on
awsâs servers in the republic of ireland. [CLS] [SEP] some of this data is either
processed by us directly or transferred to and processed by one of our third-
party partners, both of which are described in further detail in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
aws provides a list of frequently asked questions about their data privacy
practices [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **data we collect and process to provide services to you, specifically  
** if you interact with registration, application, order, or inquiry forms on
the services (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] signing up for an account, namely in order to use our
services; application for becoming an affiliate of shapeshift; or requesting
support for the services), we will collect and process the information that
you provide to us providing the services and information about the services to
you, including providing asset management dashboard services. [CLS] [SEP] this information
may include your:

  * full name; 
  * residence address; 
  * date of birth; 
  * phone number; 
  * social security number or other tax identification number; 
  * details about your government issued identification such as identification number and expiration date or a copy of the identification document; 
  * e-mail address; and
  * election to use two-factor authentication (â2faâ) on our services. [CLS] [SEP]

any wallet you connect to our services will provide us with such walletâs:
extended public keys, which are used to derive public digital wallet addresses
(known as â **xpubs** â); transaction history; and digital asset balance. [CLS] [SEP]
you can select the âforget my walletâ option at any time to disconnect
your wallet (and xpubs) from our services. [CLS] [SEP] some aspects of the services may be
inaccessible without a connected wallet. [CLS] [SEP]

the collection of words associated with a wallet, commonly known as â **seed
phrases** â are extremely important because they provide a back-up method to
access your wallet. [CLS] [SEP] shapeshift does not have access to or store seed phrases
of its users. [CLS] [SEP] we highly encourage you to write down all seed phrases upon the
time they are issued to you in connection with a wallet, and thereafter store
them in a secure location. [CLS] [SEP] shapeshift may not be able to assist you if you
cannot access your wallet due to a forgotten/lost password or seed phrase. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use the google single-sign-on option (â **sso** â), which is
denoted by the âsign up with google buttonâ, google will automatically
provide us with your email address upon your successful sign-in with google. [CLS] [SEP]

where such processing of your personal data is not strictly necessary to
perform our contractual obligations (such as in connection with providing
financial services to you) or at your request, we will use this personal data
based on our legitimate interest to: verify your identity; respond to your
inquiry; process your registration, applications, or orders; develop, enhance,
and improve the services to bring you the best possible experience; or to
safeguard the security and stability of the services. [CLS] [SEP] **â**

 **data we collect and process to analyze and improve the use of the services;
our use of cookies  
** based on our legitimate interest to bring you the best possible user
experience, we collect and process certain data to analyze how our users use
of the services to gain insight on how we may improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] this data
may include information on the type of web browser or device you use to access
the website, the geographical region where you access the website, the date
and time of your access, and the parts of the website you access. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use â **cookies** â, which are text files that are downloaded to
your computer or mobile device when you visit a website to analyze the use of
the website, to optimize our services, and to enable the use of marketing
tools. [CLS] [SEP] you can prevent the storage of cookies on your device and the
collection of data. [CLS] [SEP] by adjusting your web-browserâs settings accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]
note, however, that some functions of the services may be limited or
unavailable if you disable the storing of cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

â _in connection with the above, we use the following third-party services
to collect and analyze the data of our users:_ **â**

  * we use **google analytics** , a web analytics service provided by google. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics uses cookies to collect the information required to evaluate your use of our websites to analyze your use of the websites and to provide other services that support our analysis and improvement of the use of the websites, in which we have a legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP] we use google analytics only with ip address anonymization enabled. [CLS] [SEP] this means that your ip address will be shortened beforehand. [CLS] [SEP] only in exceptional cases will the full ip address be transmitted to a google server in the usa and shortened there. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, google only stores the information collected via cookies in anonymous form and processes it in aggregated form. [CLS] [SEP] for further information on how google analytics anonymizes ip addresses click[ here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052). [CLS] [SEP] additionally, you can prevent google analytics from using your data by installing a browser add-on to disable google analytics[ here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en). [CLS] [SEP] lastly, details on data protection and your options in connection with google analytics can be found[ here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).â 
  * we also use the google analytics tool firebase (â **firebase** â) for additional improvements to our services, in which we have a legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP] firebase specifically tracks user analytics in our mobile app such as where a user is located, the userâs email address associated with their shapeshift account, and the type of device theyâre using to access the services.
