# general terms of service

**effective date: january 1, 2020**

**posted date: december 10, 2019**

we’ve included annotations in the gray boxes below to emphasize certain
portions of our terms and help guide you as you read them. [CLS] [SEP] the annotations
aren’t summaries, so please take the time to read everything!

this page describes the general terms that apply to your use of any of our
services. [CLS] [SEP] by using our services you agree to these terms on top of any other
terms that apply to a specific service you are using (like cash app, for
example). [CLS] [SEP] if you use our services on behalf of your company, your company
agrees to them too. [CLS] [SEP]

these general terms of service (“general terms”) are a legal agreement between
you, as a current or prospective customer of square’s services (“you,” “your”)
and square, inc. [CLS] [SEP] square capital, llc, and/or cash app investing llc (”square,”
“we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of square’s services, including
mobile applications, websites, software, hardware, and other products and
services (collectively, the “services”). [CLS] [SEP] if you are using the services on
behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to bind that
business or entity to these terms, and that business accepts these terms. [CLS] [SEP] by
using any of the services, you agree to these general terms and any policies
referenced within (“policies”), including our privacy notice (see section 8)
and terms that limit our liability (see section 18) and require individual
arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see section 21), which are
collectively incorporated herein by reference. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to any
additional terms specific to services you use (“additional terms”), such as
those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us (collectively,
the “terms”). [CLS] [SEP] you should read all of our terms carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

  * [payment terms](/legal/payment): these terms apply to all payments made through the services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * [point of sale additional terms of service](/legal/pos): these terms apply when you use certain square point of sale services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * [cash additional terms of service](/legal/cash-ua): these terms apply when you use square cash or square cash for business. [CLS] [SEP]
  * [hipaa business associate agreement](/legal/hipaa): if you are subject to hipaa as a covered entity or business associate (as defined in hipaa) and use the services in a manner that causes us to create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on your behalf, then you agree to the hipaa business associate agreement (“hipaa baa”). [CLS] [SEP]
  * [square installments seller terms of service](/legal/capital-installments-seller-terms): these terms apply if you participate in the square installments program. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] square account registration

provide accurate personal information during registration and keep the
information current. [CLS] [SEP] we can suspend or terminate your account if you provide
incomplete or false information. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all activity on your account. [CLS] [SEP]

you must open an account with us (a “square account”) to use the services. [CLS] [SEP]
during registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is
not limited to, your name and other personal information. [CLS] [SEP] you must provide
accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must
keep that information current. [CLS] [SEP] you are fully responsible for all activity that
occurs under your square account, including for any actions taken by persons
to whom you have granted access to the square account. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to
change the account type, suspend or terminate the square account of anyone who
provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply
with the account registration requirements. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] revisions, disclosures and notices

we can make updates to our terms of service at any time, and we’ll notify you
of these updates as appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] by continuing to use our services after these
updates, you agree to the revised terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you also agree to receive notices from us electronically. [CLS] [SEP]

we may amend the terms at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable
under the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website or
communicating it to you through the services (each a “revised version”). [CLS] [SEP] the
revised version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not
apply retroactively. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the services after the posting of a
revised version constitutes your acceptance of such revised version. [CLS] [SEP] any
dispute (as defined in section 20) that arose before the changes will be
governed by the terms in place when the dispute arose. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to [square’s e-sign consent](/legal/sign). [CLS] [SEP] we may provide
disclosures and notices required by law and other information about your
square account to you electronically, by posting it on our website, pushing
notifications through the services, or by emailing it to the email address
listed in your square account. [CLS] [SEP] electronic disclosures and notices have the
same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. [CLS] [SEP] such
disclosures and notices are considered received by you within twenty-four (24)
hours of the time posted to our website, or within twenty-four (24) hours of
the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not
delivered. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic
communications, contact [square support](/help/us/en/). [CLS] [SEP] if we are not able to
support your request, you may need to terminate your square account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] restrictions

if you want to use our services, you can’t do certain bad things. [CLS] [SEP] if we think
you are doing these bad things, we have the right to share your information
with law enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not, nor may you permit any third party, directly or indirectly, to:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] export the services, which may be subject to export restrictions imposed by us law, including us export administration regulations (15 c.f.r. [CLS] [SEP] chapter vii);

[CLS] [SEP] if found to be in apparent violation of these restrictions, your account could be terminated and your funds could be held for an indefinite period of time;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] access or monitor any material or information on any square system using any manual process or robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] except to the extent that any restriction is expressly prohibited by law, violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on any service, work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical limitations of the services, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the services, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the services;

  12. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise use the services except as expressly allowed under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if we reasonably suspect that your square account has been used for an
unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization
to share information about you, your square account, and any of your
transactions with law enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] compatible mobile devices and third party carriers

we do not warrant that the services will be compatible with your mobile device
or carrier. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the services may be subject to the terms of your
agreements with your mobile device manufacturer or your carrier. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
use a modified device to use the services if the modification is contrary to
the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including disabling
hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jail broken.”

#### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] your content

you retain all rights to your content when you upload it into our services,
but you do give us broad rights to use, modify, display your content in our
services. [CLS] [SEP] you can see specifics on the rights you grant us below. [CLS] [SEP]

also, anything you provide us or make available to the public through our
services must not contain anything that we think is objectionable (e.g.,
illegal, obscene, hateful or harmful to you, our customers or us). [CLS] [SEP] we can
remove any content at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

the services may include functionality for uploading or providing suggestions,
recommendations, feedback, stories, photos, documents, logos, products,
loyalty programs, promotions, advertisements and other materials or
information (“content”). [CLS] [SEP]

you grant us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors a worldwide,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual,
and sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, prepare
derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display your
content throughout the world in any media for any reason, including to
provide, promote, and/or incorporate into the services. [CLS] [SEP] you retain all rights
in your content, subject to the rights you granted to us in these general
terms. [CLS] [SEP] you may modify or remove your content via your square account or by
terminating your square account, but your content may persist in historical,
archived or cached copies and versions thereof available on or through the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

you will not upload or provide content or otherwise post, transmit,
distribute, or disseminate through the services any material that: (a) is
false, misleading, unlawful, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic,
defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, abusive, or
inflammatory; (b) encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal
offense or gives rise to civil liability; (c) breaches or infringes any duty
toward or rights of any person or entity, including rights of publicity,
privacy or intellectual property; (d) contains corrupted data or any other
harmful, disruptive, or destructive files; (e) advertises products or services
competitive with square’s or its partners’ products and services, as
determined by us in our sole discretion; or (f) in our sole judgment, is
objectionable, restricts or inhibits any person or entity from using or
enjoying any portion of the services, or which may expose square, its
affiliates or its customers to harm or liability of any nature. [CLS] [SEP]

although we have no obligation to monitor any content, we have absolute
discretion to remove content at any time and for any reason without notice. [CLS] [SEP]
square may also monitor such content to detect and prevent fraudulent activity
or violations of square’s general terms. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that by using the
services, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent, or
objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any
content, including any loss or damage to any of your content. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] intellectual property infringement

we respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask you to do the
same. [CLS] [SEP] we have adopted an [intellectual property policy](/legal/copyright)
regarding third-party claims that your material infringes the rights of
others. [CLS] [SEP] we respond to all valid notices of such infringement, and our policy
is to suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat infringers. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] security

we take security incredibly seriously, but can’t guarantee that bad actors
will not gain access to your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] you need to do your part by
keeping your passwords safe, being smart about who has access to your account
and which of your devices can access our services, and letting us know if you
think an unauthorized person is using your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if there is ever a dispute about who owns your account, we are the decider. [CLS] [SEP]

we have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure
your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access,
use, alteration, or disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] however, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized
third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal
information for improper purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you provide your personal information at
your own risk. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access
to the services from your compatible mobile devices and computer(s). [CLS] [SEP] you will
immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or square
account or any other breach of security. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding sections 20 and 21,
in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account
ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]
our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any square
account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] privacy

when you process information that identifies or is reasonably capable of
identifying an individual to square in connection with the services (including
information collected by square on your behalf), you agree to comply with
applicable laws regarding the collection, use, disclosure, protection, and
retention of this information. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that you have reviewed and
consent to square’s [privacy notice](/legal/privacy), which explains our
practices with regard to any personal information you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP] if you or
your business are located in california, please see section 27. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] communications

you consent to us sending messages to your email or mobile devices about your
account or our services, which may include marketing. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out of
communications in ways that are specific to that communication method, such as
by unsubscribing from emails, or replying to text messages with ‘stop’. [CLS] [SEP]

you consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail,
text messages, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number
you provide to us when you sign-up for a square account or update the contact
information associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP] such communications may include, but
are not limited to requests for secondary authentication, receipts, reminders,
notifications regarding updates to your account or account support, and
marketing or promotional communications. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that you are not
required to consent to receive promotional texts or calls as a condition of
using the services. [CLS] [SEP] call and text message communications may be generated by
automatic telephone dialing systems. [CLS] [SEP] standard message and data rates applied
by your cell phone carrier may apply to the text messages we send you. [CLS] [SEP]

you may opt-out of receiving promotional email communications we send to you
by following the unsubscribe options on such emails. [CLS] [SEP] you may opt out of any
promotional phone calls by informing the caller that you would not like to
receive future promotional calls. [CLS] [SEP] you may only opt-out of text messages from
square by replying stop. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that opting out of receiving
communications may impact your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] paid services

lots of what we offer is free, but we offer paid services too. [CLS] [SEP] we can collect
payments for a paid service by either charging your linked debit/credit card
or taking the payment from your transaction proceeds, square-account balance
or linked bank account. [CLS] [SEP]

we’ll give you 30 days advance notice if we change our subscription fees, and
you can cancel your subscription at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

square may offer services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“subscription
services”) or on an as-used basis (“a la carte services” and, together with
the subscription services, “paid services”). [CLS] [SEP] subscription services may subject
you to recurring fees and/or terms. [CLS] [SEP] by signing up for a subscription service,
including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription
fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your square account settings or
as otherwise agreed in writing (“subscription fee”). [CLS] [SEP] a la carte services may
subject you to fees charged per usage and/or terms. [CLS] [SEP] by using an a la carte
service, you agree to pay the fees and any taxes incurred at the time of usage
(“a la carte fees” and, together with subscription fees, the “paid service
fees”). [CLS] [SEP]

paid service fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from
your transaction proceeds. [CLS] [SEP] if you link a debit or credit card to your account,
you authorize us to collect paid service fees by debit from your linked debit
card or charge to your linked credit card. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of payment device, we
reserve the right to collect paid service fees by deduction from your
transaction proceeds, the balance (as defined in the payment terms) in your
square account or your linked bank account. [CLS] [SEP]

unless otherwise provided in a subscription service’s terms, subscription fees
will be charged on the 1st of every month until cancelled. [CLS] [SEP] you may cancel a
subscription service at any time from your square account settings. [CLS] [SEP] if you
cancel a subscription service, you will continue to have access to that
subscription service through the end of your then current billing period, but
you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any subscription fee
already due or paid. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change our subscription fee upon
thirty (30) days’ advance notice. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of subscription services
after notice of a change to our subscription fee will constitute your
agreement to such changes. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] modification and termination

we can terminate or deny you access to our services at any time, for any
reason. [CLS] [SEP] you can also choose to deactivate your account at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

we may terminate these general terms or any additional terms, or suspend or
terminate your square account or your access to any service, at any time for
any reason. [CLS] [SEP] we may add or remove, suspend, stop, delete, discontinue or impose
conditions on services or any feature or aspect of a service. [CLS] [SEP] we will take
reasonable steps to notify you of termination or these other types of service
changes by email or at the next time you attempt to access your square
account. [CLS] [SEP] you may also terminate the general terms and additional terms
applicable to your square account by deactivating your square account at any
time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] effect of termination

once our relationship ends, we are not responsible for any losses you
experience because of the termination of our services or for removing your
data from our servers. [CLS] [SEP] some terms of our agreement will still apply even after
our relationship ends. [CLS] [SEP]

if these general terms or your square account is terminated or suspended for
any reason: (a) the license and any other rights granted under these terms
will end, (b) we may (but have no obligation to) delete your information and
account data stored on our servers, and (c) we will not be liable to you or
any third party for compensation, reimbursement, or damages for any
termination or suspension of the services, or for deletion of your information
or account data. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to any payment obligations under the payment
terms, the following sections of these general terms survive and remain in
effect in accordance with their terms upon termination: 5 (your content), 6
(intellectual property infringement), 12 (effect of termination), 14
(ownership), 15 (indemnity), 16 (representations and warranties), 17 (no
warranties), 18 (limitation of liability and damages), 19 (third party
products), 20 (disputes), 21 (binding individual arbitration), 22 (governing
law), 23 (limitation on time to initiate a dispute), 24 (assignment), 25
(third party service and links to other web sites), and 28 (other provisions). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 13\. [CLS] [SEP] your license

we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable license to use the software that is part of the services, as
authorized in these general terms. [CLS] [SEP] we may make software updates to the
services available to you, which you must install to continue using the
services. [CLS] [SEP] any such software updates may be subject to additional terms made
known to you at that time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 14\. [CLS] [SEP] ownership

while we’re happy to let you use our services, you don’t have any ownership
rights in them. [CLS] [SEP] we can act on any ideas you share with us about how we can
improve our products and services free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these general terms. [CLS] [SEP] we
own all rights, title, interest, copyright and other intellectual property
rights (as defined below) in the services and all copies of the services. [CLS] [SEP]
these general terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks or service
marks. [CLS] [SEP]

for the purposes of these general terms, “intellectual property rights” means
all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of
publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade
secret rights, and other intellectual property rights that may exist now or
come into existence in the future, and all of their applications,
registrations, renewals and extensions, under the laws of any state, country,
territory or other jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

you may submit comments or ideas about the services (“ideas”). [CLS] [SEP] by submitting
any idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited, and
without restriction, that it will not place us under any fiduciary,
confidentiality or other obligation, and that we are free to use the idea
without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the idea on a
non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 15\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnity

if you do something using our services that gets us sued or fined, you agree
to cover our losses as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

you will indemnify, defend, and hold us and our processors (and our respective
employees, directors, agents, affiliates and representatives) harmless from
and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, tax
assessments, penalties, interest, and expenses (including without limitation
reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit,
investigation, inquiry, or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity
that arises out of or relates to: (a) any actual or alleged breach of your
representations, warranties, or obligations set forth in these terms; (b) your
wrongful or improper use of the services; (c) your violation of any third-
party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity
rights or intellectual property rights; (d) your violation of any law, rule or
regulation of the united states or any other country; (e) any third-party
claims made by your buyer regarding square’s processing of your
customer/buyer’s personal information in connection with providing you with
the services; and (f) any other party’s access and/or use of the services with
your unique name, password or other appropriate security code. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 16\. [CLS] [SEP] representations and warranties

here’s the part where you promise that you are who you say you are, and that
you will obey the law and our terms. [CLS] [SEP]

you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least eighteen (18) years
of age; (b) you are eligible to register and use the services and have the
right, power, and ability to enter into and perform under these general terms;
(c) any information you provide in connection with the services, including
your business name, accurately and truthfully represents your business or
personal identity under which you sell goods and services; (d) you and all
transactions initiated by you will comply with all federal, state, and local
laws, rules, and regulations applicable to you and/or your business, including
the health insurance portability and accountability act (“hipaa”); (e) you
will not use the services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent
undertaking or in any manner so as to interfere with the operation of the
services; and (f) your use of the services will be in compliance with these
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17\. [CLS] [SEP] no warranties

while we do our best to bring great products and services to our customers, we
provide them as-is, without warranties. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for any goods
and services that you might buy or sell using square’s services. [CLS] [SEP]

the use of “square” in sections 17 and 18 means square, its processors, its
suppliers, and its licensors (and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
agents, directors, and employees). [CLS] [SEP]

the services are provided “as is” without representation or warranty, whether
it is express, implied, or statutory. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, square
specifically disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, or non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

square does not warrant or guarantee that the services are accurate, reliable
or correct; that the services will meet your requirements; that the services
will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted, error-
free, without defect or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected;
or that the services are free of viruses or other harmful components. [CLS] [SEP]

square does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any
product or service advertised or offered by a third party. [CLS] [SEP] square does not
have control of, or liability for, goods or services that are paid for using
the services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 18\. [CLS] [SEP] limitations of liability and damages

as described below, if something bad happens because of your use of our
services, our liability is capped. [CLS] [SEP]

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will square be
liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential,
or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of
profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, that result from the
use of, inability to use, or unavailability of the service. [CLS] [SEP] in all cases,
square will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably
foreseeable. [CLS] [SEP]

under no circumstances will square be responsible for any damage, loss, or
injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use
of the services or your square account, or the information contained therein. [CLS] [SEP]

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total liability of
square is limited to the greater of (a) the amount of fees earned by us in
connection with your use of the services during the three (3) month period
immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability, or (b)
$500. [CLS] [SEP]

this limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is
based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis,
even if square has been advised of the possibility of such damage. [CLS] [SEP] the
foregoing limitation of liability will apply to the fullest extent permitted
by law in the applicable jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 19\. [CLS] [SEP] third party products

all third party hardware and other products included or sold with the services
are provided solely according to the warranty and other terms specified by the
manufacturer, who is solely responsible for service and support for its
product. [CLS] [SEP] for service, support, or warranty assistance, you should contact the
manufacturer directly. [CLS] [SEP] square makes no representations or warranties, express
or implied, with respect to such third party products, and expressly disclaims
any warranty or condition of merchantability, non-infringement, or fitness for
a particular purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20\. [CLS] [SEP] disputes

when you see the word “dispute” in these terms, here’s what it means. [CLS] [SEP]

“disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and
square, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective
affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in
any way to these terms or the services, or any other aspect of our
relationship. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 21\. [CLS] [SEP] binding individual arbitration

this section provides details about how we will resolve disputes through the
arbitration process. [CLS] [SEP]

you and square agree to arbitrate any and all disputes by a neutral arbitrator
who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief
that a court can. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration under these general terms will only be on an
individual basis; class arbitrations, class actions, representative actions,
and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted. [CLS] [SEP] you waive any
right to have your case decided by a jury and you waive any right to
participate in a class action against square. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this
arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will
be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no
case will there be a class or representative arbitration). [CLS] [SEP] all disputes will
be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a
single arbitrator (the “arbitrator”) administered by the american arbitration
association [(https://www.adr.org)](https://www.adr.org) according to this
section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues,
including issues relating to whether the general terms and/or additional terms
(or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any
defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. [CLS] [SEP] subject
to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim
in your local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as
your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual
(non-class or non-representative) basis. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act, 9 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP]
§§ 1-16, fully applies. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to a
transaction intended for a personal, household, or family use, any arbitration
hearing will occur within the county where you reside. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, any
arbitration hearing will occur in san francisco, california, or another
mutually agreeable location. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s award will be binding on the
parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] while an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief,
the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
individual party’s claim. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will
not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. [CLS] [SEP] square will reimburse
the arbitration fees due to the american arbitration association for
individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section for all claims
totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines that your claims
were frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] if you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled
to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]
for any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay
our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the
arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of this
arbitration provision, references to you and square also include respective
subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and
assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the services. [CLS] [SEP] subject
to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any
judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases as
discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the city and county of san

california. [CLS] [SEP]

b) we may receive personal information from buyers for the purpose of
performing services on your behalf as described in these general terms. [CLS] [SEP] we
agree that we will process buyer personal information collected, processed,
stored or transmitted by, or accessible to us in the course of these general
terms, and other applicable terms of service referenced above, only on your
behalf, and for the purpose of providing you with the services in these terms
and other applicable terms linked above based on the products you use. [CLS] [SEP] we
acknowledge that we are prohibited from: (i) selling the buyer personal
information; (ii) retaining, using, or disclosing the buyer personal
information for any purpose other than providing to you the services specified
in these general terms(s), and other applicable terms of service referenced
above. [CLS] [SEP] as part of, and for purposes of, facilitating the services, square may
(i) de-identify or aggregate the buyer personal information; and (ii) process
the buyer personal information for operational purposes, including, without
limitation, verifying or maintaining the quality and safety of the services;
improving, updating or enhancing the services either for you or for our
customers generally; detecting and preventing fraud, and for protecting the
security and integrity of our services; and complying with our legal
obligations. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that buyer personal information that

purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

c) we reserve the right to delete personal information stored pursuant to
these general terms in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to our
retention schedules. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 28\. [CLS] [SEP] other provisions

these general terms, and any applicable additional terms or policies, are a
complete statement of the agreement between you and square regarding the
services. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a conflict between these general terms and any other
square agreement or policy, these general terms will prevail and control the
subject matter of such conflict. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of these general terms or
any additional term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it
will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision
to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining
provisions will continue in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] these general terms do not
limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or
