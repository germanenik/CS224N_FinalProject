## information we collect

the personal information we collect is related to providing the platform and
its features and falls into three general categories:

  * information you provide to us

  * information collected automatically

  * information we obtain from third parties

### information you provide

we ask for and collect the below personal information when you use the
platform. [CLS] [SEP] this information is necessary for the adequate performance of the
contract between you and us and to comply with our obligations thereunder. [CLS] [SEP]

we process this information in light of our legitimate interest in improving
the platform and giving our users the best experience, and where it is
necessary for the adequate performance of any contract between us and you,
including but not limited to the terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] without it, we may not be able
to provide you with all the requested services and features of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

you donât need to register for a soundcloud account in order to visit or use
our platform. [CLS] [SEP] however, certain services require that you register for an
account and, by doing so, you will need to provide us with certain
information:

  * **account information** \- when you register any kind of soundcloud account, you will need to provide your email address (except when you sign-up with facebook, google or apple and donât give your permission to share it with soundcloud), your age, and choose a password. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you purchase a subscription, you will also need to provide your real name, billing address, and payment verification information. [CLS] [SEP]

    * details of your other websites and social media profiles, including links to those pages

    * your gender if you wish to provide it

    * any additional information you choose to provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. [CLS] [SEP] this information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the website, or using our api or other services. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **communications** \- when you communicate with soundcloud by email or through the platform, or use the platform to communicate with other users, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **survey information** \- if you participate in any survey, you may provide certain personal data as part of your response, unless you respond anonymously. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **information you post** \- you may provide personal data when you upload sounds to the platform, or when you post comments, or contribute to community discussions. [CLS] [SEP]

### information we collect automatically

there is certain information that we collect automatically as the result of
your use of the platform, subject to the choices you make in your
[settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings), or through the use of cookies and
other web analytics services as described in our [cookie
policy](/pages/cookies). [CLS] [SEP] this information generally includes:

  * **usage information** \- we collect information about your interactions with the platform, including the pages that you visit and links you click on, streaming, offline listening or downloading tracks, uploading or recording tracks, connecting your facebook, google or apple account, sharing a sound with another user, following or unfollowing another user, posting a comment, performing a search, the time, frequency and duration of your visits to the platform, and whether you interact with email messages, for example, if you opened, clicked on, or forwarded the email message. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **log data** â we automatically collect log information when you use the platform, even if you have not registered for an account or logged in. [CLS] [SEP] that information includes, among other things: details about how youâve used the platform (including links to third party sites or services), internet protocol (ip) address, access times, your browser type and operating system, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page youâve viewed or engaged with before or after using the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **cookies** â we use cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels, local storage, and mobile device identifiers and may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on our use of these technologies, see our [cookie policy](/pages/cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

  * **location data** â when you use certain features of the platform, we may collect data about your general location (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] ip address).

[CLS] [SEP] appleâs ios advertising identifier (idfa) and googleâs android advertising id are examples of device identifiers. [CLS] [SEP] this information allows us to recognize and associate your activity, and provide personalized content and advertising, consistently across all of your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **software development kits** (âsdkâ) - we may use third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile sdks to collect information and information related to how mobile devices interact with the platform. [CLS] [SEP] an sdk is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **soundcloud widget** \- other websites may integrate soundcloud widgets; when you visit a website with a soundcloud widget embedded, we may receive certain information, including information about the website you visited. [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud and the widget may be able to recognize you in order to retrieve your library of content, and in some cases the widget may be used to show personalized content. [CLS] [SEP] we know when you interact with a widget, and websites containing the widgets may receive this information as well. [CLS] [SEP]

### information from third parties

[CLS] [SEP] we explain in more detail why and how we use this information below. [CLS] [SEP]

## how we use your information

we use the personal information we collect from you, including with the help
of automated systems and decision making, for a range of different business
purposes according to different legal bases of processing and subject to the
choices you make in your [settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings). [CLS] [SEP]

  * **provide, improve, and develop the platform**

we process this information primarily for the adequate performance of our
contract with you (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] [terms of use](https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use)). [CLS] [SEP]
we may also process this information in light of our legitimate interest in
improving the platform and giving our users the best experience. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to operate and maintain your soundcloud account, and to provide you with access to and use of the platform. [CLS] [SEP] your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the platform. [CLS] [SEP] your device-ids are used to ensure that you are in control of the devices that have access to your subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other contributions that you make to the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to provide creators with stats and insights about usersâ listening behavior of their sounds, (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] streaming and downloading their sounds or following their profiles). [CLS] [SEP]

    * we conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities. [CLS] [SEP]

    * if you purchase a subscription, your name, address and payment verification information will be used to process your account subscription and renewals and to collect your payment. [CLS] [SEP] all payment verification information is transmitted using industry-standard ssl (secure socket layer) encryption. [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud also complies with the payment card industry security standards. [CLS] [SEP]

    * your email will be used to send you service updates and notifications about your account. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted. [CLS] [SEP]

    * we use your age to enable age restrictions. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **maintain a safe and secure environment**

we process this information in light of our legitimate interest in improving
the platform and giving our users the best experience, and where it is
necessary for the adequate performance of our contract with you (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] terms of
use). [CLS] [SEP]

    * detect and prevent fraud, spam, abuse, security incidents, and other suspicious activity. [CLS] [SEP]

    * verify and authenticate your identity and prevent unauthorized or illegal activity. [CLS] [SEP]

    * enhance the safety and security of our products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

    * conduct security investigations and risk assessments. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our terms of use, community guidelines or applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to provide you with customer and technical support. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **personalize content, advertising and marketing**

we process this information based on your consent. [CLS] [SEP] you can revisit your
choices in your [settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings/advertising). [CLS] [SEP]

    * to improve your experience on the platform by providing personalized content, recommendations, and features. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to customize the content and measure performance of any email, push notification, or in-app message we may send to you. [CLS] [SEP]

    * administer sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by soundcloud or its partners. [CLS] [SEP]

    * use automated systems and decision making to profile user characteristics and infer preferences based on information that you provide to us, your interactions with the platform and content, your profile information, and information obtained from third parties. [CLS] [SEP] this data is used to create groups of users, called segments, who share similar characteristics and interests; we use segments to serve personalized content, advertising, and marketing messages. [CLS] [SEP] we also use automated systems to associate your activity over time across devices, and may associate activity and accounts under a single user id, in order to determine that certain devices are related to each other and provide you with a personalized experience across devices and platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

    * to deliver targeted marketing for soundcloud products on and off the platform and measure the success of those campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] when you see our ads on a third party website or apps, we or third party services we engage for this purpose, may collect information that your browser or mobile app makes available when seeing the ad (e.g ip address, referral url, browser details, timestamp of request), including whether a click converted to an actual purchase of a subscription. [CLS] [SEP] please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out. [CLS] [SEP]

    * ads are more effective when they are shown to people who are likely to be interested in the product or service advertised. [CLS] [SEP] for this reason, we use the information we collect and receive to help us select which ads to show you on behalf of advertisers. [CLS] [SEP] this includes information you choose to provide to us (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] age and gender) and make available to us when you interact with the platform (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] by listening, liking or creating playlists), as well as device information and general location data. [CLS] [SEP] we may also display ads based on the page youâre on or content you have recently viewed, searched, or listened to. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to show you ads that will likely be more relevant and interesting to you. [CLS] [SEP]

    * when we engage third party services such as ad-networks and exchanges that enable us showing you targeted ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data and device information. [CLS] [SEP] that information is used to synch or match users to segments and serve targeted advertising, including based on device activity, inferred interests, and general location information. [CLS] [SEP] we act based on your consent which you may revisit at all times in your [settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings/advertising). [CLS] [SEP]

    * combine information we collect about you with information from business partners and use it to serve more relevant advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

furthermore, we may use your data for other purposes, provided we disclose the
purposes and use to you at the relevant time, and provided that you consent to
the proposed use of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] which of your data we process on the
basis of your consent depends on the purpose of your consent. [CLS] [SEP] typical purposes
include:

    * subscription to a newsletter. [CLS] [SEP]

    * participation in surveys and market research studies. [CLS] [SEP]

    * using cookies and similar technologies according to your settings. [CLS] [SEP]

## sharing of your information

this section describes how the information collected or generated through your
use of the platform may be shared by you or by us. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **through your profile** â any information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. [CLS] [SEP] creators will be able to see in their statistics that you have listened to the tracks they uploaded. [CLS] [SEP] they will also be able to see how many times you have listened to any of their sounds, and that you are following them. [CLS] [SEP] this is to allow creators to track the popularity of their sounds. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the platform, your comments will be available to all users of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **with your consent** â we will disclose your information if you have agreed that we may do so. [CLS] [SEP] we will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information, including the purpose(s) for which we will use the data. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **service providers** â we use a variety of service providers, some of who may be located outside of the european economic area (âeeaâ), to provide services to us or to our users on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers have access to your information solely to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us. [CLS] [SEP] we need to share your information, including personal information, in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we work closely with service providers in the area of customer service (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] help center, content moderation), with technical service providers (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] running computer centres) or music service providers (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] rights administration) and payment service providers. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers may generally only process your data on our behalf under special conditions. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **content partners** â the platform allows you to listen to a variety of audio content, including licensed streaming content from our commercial content partners. [CLS] [SEP] we share information with these content partners that license this content to us to help them understand how the content they provide is performing, including insights about general user listening trends and preferences. [CLS] [SEP] we use technical measures to ensure the data is de-identified and/or aggregated so it does not identify you directly. [CLS] [SEP] we share this data based on our legitimate interest in helping content partners deliver high performing content and to ensure the fulfillment of our contract with those partners. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **advertising** â we share the data collected about you, generally in hashed, aggregated, or de-identified forms with advertisers and advertising service providers and business partners in order to serve ads based on your interests and measure the reach and effectiveness of those ads, including whether a user took an action (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] purchase a product). [CLS] [SEP] we may also share cookie data and device identifiers with service providers for data matching purposes, in order to improve ad targeting. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a user located in the eu, you can find a detailed overview of our advertisers [here](https://soundcloud.com/settings/advertising). [CLS] [SEP]

  * **social media** â for users outside of the eu/eea, where permissible under applicable law, or with your explicit consent, we may share your email address (in hashed form, so that it does not identify you) with facebook in order to target you with ads for soundcloud products on facebook and on third party websites and applications in the [facebook audience network](https://www.facebook.com/business/products/audience-network). [CLS] [SEP] we also allow facebook and other social media platforms to collect information through cookies and similar technologies like pixels in order to serve ads for soundcloud on those third party websites and apps and drive users to our platform. [CLS] [SEP] in order to measure the effectiveness of and optimize these marketing campaigns, these technologies track activity taken across devices after a user sees a soundcloud ad, in order to determine performance metrics like sign ups, visits to the platform, and purchases. [CLS] [SEP] we undertake these activities based on our legitimate interest in acquiring new customers and offering products we think you may be interested in. [CLS] [SEP] any questions regarding how these social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such third party platform. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **aggregated data** â we may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we render in such a way that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other pseudonymised information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **api integrations** â soundcloud has an open application-programming interface (api), which enables application developers to integrate elements of the platform into other apps. [CLS] [SEP] some of these developers may be located outside of the eea. [CLS] [SEP] any information you choose to make public on the platform, including your public profile information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers, subject to our [api terms of use](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use). [CLS] [SEP] please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile. [CLS] [SEP] for information on how to limit the information that is available through the api, please see the your choices and controls section below. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **third party applications** â if you choose to connect your soundcloud account to other apps or social networks such as facebook you may be sharing certain information with these apps or networks. [CLS] [SEP] content that you share with facebook will appear on your timeline and in your facebook friendsâ newsfeeds. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your soundcloudâ® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favorite, or repost sounds from within the app. [CLS] [SEP] this means sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. [CLS] [SEP] soundcloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust. [CLS] [SEP] for information on how to control the information that you share, and how to disconnect your account from these apps, please see the your choices and controls section below. [CLS] [SEP] **if you do not want this information shared with facebook or google, please change your soundcloud[settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings) on our platform or in those networks.**

soundcloud maintains appropriate technical, administrative, and physical
safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure
of personal information we collect or store and to ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons that may be involved with our processing
operations. [CLS] [SEP] we regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and
attacks. [CLS] [SEP] however, it is not possible to guarantee the security of information
transmitted over the internet. [CLS] [SEP] you use the platform and provide us with
information at your own discretion and risk. [CLS] [SEP]

## international data transfers

soundcloud operates globally and may share your information internally within
the soundcloud group, and third parties for the purposes described in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] information collected within the eea may, for example, be
transferred to countries outside of the eea for the purposes as described in
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we utilize appropriate safeguards such as [standard
contractual clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/txt/?uri=celex%3a32010d0087) approved by the european commission, or
another legally approved mechanism, to ensure the lawful transfer of your
personal data outside of the eea. [CLS] [SEP] the standard contractual clauses can be
accessed at any time at <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/all/?uri=celex%3a32010d0087>. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, you can request these
documents from us using the contact details given below. [CLS] [SEP]

## children

soundcloud is not intended for use by children. [CLS] [SEP] anyone under the age of 16 in
the eea, or 13 in the united states and the rest of the world, is not
permitted to use the platform and must not attempt to register an account or
submit any personal information to us. [CLS] [SEP] we do not knowingly collect any
personal information from any person who is under the age of 16 or 13, as the
case may be, or allow them to register an account. [CLS] [SEP] if it comes to our
attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of
16 or 13, as applicable, we will delete this information as quickly as
possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such
personal data, please notify us immediately at
[dataprotection@soundcloud.com](mailto:dataprotection@soundcloud.com). [CLS] [SEP]

## your choices and controls

we do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of
information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **managing soundcloud settings**. [CLS] [SEP] if you register an account, you may manage the content and information you share when you use soundcloud through your account [settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings), including for the features explained below. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for keeping your [settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings) up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **email** â you can adjust your settings in the notification tab to disable email and desktop notifications (other than important service updates and essential notifications about the platform or your account). [CLS] [SEP] all commercial emails and newsletters also allow you to unsubscribe at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **analytics** â to control whether we collect analytics and usage information, including through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your settings in the âanalyticsâ tab. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **marketing** â if you do not want to receive personalized ads, offers or other marketing messages for soundcloud products or services, you can adjust your settings in the âcommunicationsâ tab. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **advertising** â if you do not want soundcloud to deliver âinterest basedâ or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your settings in the âadvertisingâ tab. [CLS] [SEP] please note, however, that even if you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see ads, but they will likely not be as relevant or useful to you. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **content sharing** â itâs not possible to make your account entirely private. [CLS] [SEP] however, you do have the option to make all of your tracks, playlists and other uploads private. [CLS] [SEP] this means that no one will be able to access and listen to your sounds without your explicit permission. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about these settings [here](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003562388-changing-your-track-s-privacy-setting). [CLS] [SEP]

    * **third party apps** â if you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application, like facebook or google, you can disable permission for the app by adjusting your settings in the âconnectionsâ tab. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **third party developers** â soundcloud has an open api, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the platform. [CLS] [SEP] if you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable api access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. [CLS] [SEP] click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the âapps enabledâ box at the bottom of the page. [CLS] [SEP] please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the website. [CLS] [SEP]

    * **deleting your account** â if you have an account and would like to delete it, you may do so by adjusting you settings in the account tab. [CLS] [SEP] if you delete your account, all data associated with your account (except for backup copies), including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. [CLS] [SEP] we therefore advise you to copy or backup all content uploaded to your account before deletion. [CLS] [SEP] even if you delete your soundcloud account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. [CLS] [SEP] search enginesâ caching processes are outside of soundcloudâs control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the platform. [CLS] [SEP] please note that deleting any soundcloud apps, or any third party apps to which your soundcloud account is connected, will not delete your soundcloud account. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your soundcloud account over our api, this will not necessarily delete all data about your soundcloud activity from within that third party app. [CLS] [SEP] you will need to refer to the app providerâs terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete data about your soundcloud activity from that third party app. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **managing device settings**

    * on your mobile device, enable the âlimit ad trackingâ setting in your ios phoneâs settings, or the setting to âopt out of ads personalizationâ in your android phoneâs settings. [CLS] [SEP] to opt-out of location tracking when using our apps, you can use the settings of your device. [CLS] [SEP] you can disable mobile analytics and bug reporting through these same settings as well. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **managing browser settings**

    * to control cookies, you can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie. [CLS] [SEP] you can also manually delete previously stored cookies at any time. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the platform or prevent certain elements of it from functioning. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **additional choices and controls**

    * for more information about analytics and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the [network advertising initiativeâs opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [digital advertising allianceâs opt-out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), or <http://youronlinechoices.eu>.

[CLS] [SEP] please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **lodging complaints**

    * you have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by soundcloud before a competent data protection authority. [CLS] [SEP] a list of eu data protection authorities is available at <http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080>. [CLS] [SEP]
