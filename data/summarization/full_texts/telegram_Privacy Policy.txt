# telegram privacy policy

### __1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction

this privacy policy sets out how we, telegram messenger inc. [CLS] [SEP] **(“telegram”)**
, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is
otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our
cloud-based messaging services (the **“services”** ). [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this
privacy policy, **‘we’** , **‘us’** and **‘our’** refers to telegram, and
**‘you’** refers to you, the user of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __1.1 privacy principles

telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and
processing private data:

  * we don't use your data to show you ads. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we only store the data that telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __1.2. [CLS] [SEP] terms of service

this privacy policy forms part of our terms of service, which describes the
terms under which you use our services and which are available at
**[<https://telegram.org/tos>](https://telegram.org/tos)**. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy
policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __1.3. [CLS] [SEP] table of contents

this privacy policy explains the following:

  * the legal basis for processing your personal data;
  * what personal data we may collect from you;
  * how we keep your personal data safe;
  * what we may use your personal data for;
  * who your personal data may be shared with; and 
  * your rights regarding your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __1.4. [CLS] [SEP] eea representative

if you live in a country in the [european economic
area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area) (eea), the
services are provided by telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data
protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal
data when you use our services. [CLS] [SEP] however, as telegram is located outside the
eea, we have designated one of our eea-based group companies, telegram uk
holdings ltd (71-75 shelton street, covent garden, london, england, wc2h 9jq),
as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our
processing of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

### __2\. [CLS] [SEP] legal ground for processing your personal data

we process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary
to further our legitimate interests (including: _(1)_ providing effective and
innovative services to our users; and _(2)_ to detect, prevent or otherwise
address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of services),
unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights
and freedoms that require protections of personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

### __3\. [CLS] [SEP] what personal data we use

#### __3.1. [CLS] [SEP] basic account data

telegram is a communication service. [CLS] [SEP] you provide your mobile number and basic
account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about
information) to create a telegram account. [CLS] [SEP]

to make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and
recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and
your [username](https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-me) (should you
choose to set one) on telegram are always public. [CLS] [SEP] we don't want to know your
real name, gender, age or what you like. [CLS] [SEP]

we do **not** require your screen name to be your real name. [CLS] [SEP] note that users
who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by
your screen name. [CLS] [SEP] this way your mother can have the public name 'johnny depp'
while appearing as 'mom' to you and as 'boss' to her underlings at work (or
the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __3.2. [CLS] [SEP] your e-mail address

when you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using
the telegram passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery
email. [CLS] [SEP] this address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if
you forget it. [CLS] [SEP] that's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __3.3. [CLS] [SEP] your messages

##### __3.3.1. [CLS] [SEP] cloud chats

telegram is a cloud service. [CLS] [SEP] we store messages, photos, videos and documents
from your _cloud chats_ on our servers so that you can access your data from
any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. [CLS] [SEP] all
data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are
stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP] this way
local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data. [CLS] [SEP]

##### __3.3.2. [CLS] [SEP] secret chats

_secret chats_ use end-to-end encryption. [CLS] [SEP] this means that all data is
encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. [CLS] [SEP] there is **no way**
for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what
content is being sent in those messages. [CLS] [SEP] we do not store your secret chats on
our servers. [CLS] [SEP] we also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so
after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via
secret chats. [CLS] [SEP] for the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud
— you can only access those messages from the device they were sent _to_ or
_from_. [CLS] [SEP]

##### __3.3.3. [CLS] [SEP] media in secret chats

when you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded,
each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. [CLS] [SEP] this key
and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret
chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. [CLS] [SEP] they can then download and decipher
the file. [CLS] [SEP] this means that the file is technically on one of telegram’s
servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to
everyone except for you and the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t know what this random data
stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. [CLS] [SEP] we
periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space. [CLS] [SEP]

##### __3.3.4. [CLS] [SEP] public chats

in addition to private messages, telegram also supports public channels and
public groups. [CLS] [SEP] all public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). [CLS] [SEP]
like everything on telegram, the data you post in public communities is
encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public
will be accessible to everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

##### __3.3.5. [CLS] [SEP] phone number and contacts

telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you
to switch from sms and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. [CLS] [SEP] we
ask your permission before syncing your contacts. [CLS] [SEP]

we store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of
your contacts signs up for telegram and to properly display names in
notifications. [CLS] [SEP] we only need the number and name (first and last) for this to
work and store no other data about your contacts. [CLS] [SEP]

our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to
calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone
number may have on telegram. [CLS] [SEP] when you open the 'invite friends' interface, we
display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of
who could benefit most from joining telegram. [CLS] [SEP]

you can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in
settings > privacy & security > data settings. [CLS] [SEP]

> if you are using android, telegram will ask you for permission to access
> your phone call logs (read_call_log). [CLS] [SEP] if you grant this permission, telegram
> will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of
> asking you to enter a code. [CLS] [SEP] telegram uses this permission only to confirm
> receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log. [CLS] [SEP]

##### __3.3.6. [CLS] [SEP] cookies

the only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our services on the
web. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. [CLS] [SEP] the cookies we use
are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our services, and
in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience. [CLS] [SEP] your browser should
allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them
and how to remove them. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to block cookies with your web browser,
however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to
telegram web. [CLS] [SEP]

### __4\. [CLS] [SEP] keeping your personal data safe

#### __4.1. [CLS] [SEP] storing data

if you signed up for telegram from the uk or the eea, your data is stored in
data centers in the netherlands. [CLS] [SEP] these are third-party provided data centers
in which telegram rents a designated space. [CLS] [SEP] however, the servers and networks
that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored
are owned by telegram. [CLS] [SEP] as such, we do not share your personal data with such
data centers. [CLS] [SEP] all data is stored heavily encrypted so that local telegram
engineers or physical intruders cannot get access. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __4.2. [CLS] [SEP] end-to-end encrypted data

your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as
well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your [telegram
passport](https://telegram.org/blog/passport) are processed only on your
device and on the device of your recipient. [CLS] [SEP] before this data reaches our
servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] while
telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to
the recipient – or store it in the case of telegram passport data, we have no
ways of deciphering the actual information. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, we neither store nor
process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of
symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __4.3. [CLS] [SEP] retention

unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy, the personal data that you
provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to
fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

### __5\. [CLS] [SEP] processing your personal data

#### __5.1. [CLS] [SEP] our services

telegram is a cloud service. [CLS] [SEP] we will process your data to deliver your cloud
chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your
choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __5.2. [CLS] [SEP] safety and security

telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse
and terms of service violations. [CLS] [SEP] telegram also has more than [400
million](https://telegram.org/blog/400-million) users which makes it a
lucrative target for spammers. [CLS] [SEP] to improve the security of your account, as
well as to prevent [spam](https://telegram.org/faq_spam), abuse, and other
violations of our terms of service, we may collect metadata such as your ip
address, devices and telegram apps you've used, history of username changes,
etc. [CLS] [SEP] if collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __5.3. [CLS] [SEP] spam and abuse

to prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of
telegram’s terms of service, our moderators may check messages that were
reported to them by their recipients. [CLS] [SEP] if a spam report on a message you sent
is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting
strangers – temporarily or permanently. [CLS] [SEP] you can send an appeal using
[@spambot](https://t.me/spambot). [CLS] [SEP] in case of more serious violations, your
account may be banned. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use automated algorithms to analyze
messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __5.4. [CLS] [SEP] cross-device functionality

we may also store some aggregated metadata to create telegram features (see
section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __5.5. [CLS] [SEP] advanced features

we may use some aggregated data about how you use telegram to build useful
features. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you open the search menu, telegram displays the
people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen. [CLS] [SEP] to do
this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. [CLS] [SEP] a
similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the
bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a
new message with “@”). [CLS] [SEP] to turn this feature off and delete the relevant data,
go to settings > privacy & security > data settings and disable “suggest
frequent contacts”. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __5.6. [CLS] [SEP] no ads

unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other
commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP] telegram only stores the information it needs to function
as a secure and feature-rich cloud service. [CLS] [SEP]

### __6\. [CLS] [SEP] bot messages

#### __6.1. [CLS] [SEP] ecosystem

telegram has an api that allows third-party developers to create
[bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots). [CLS] [SEP] bots are apps that look like special
telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups
or use a special [“inline”](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots) interface
to access their features. [CLS] [SEP] by performing any of these actions, you will be
sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __6.2. [CLS] [SEP] how bots can receive data

you can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one
of these ways:

  * by sending messages to a bot. [CLS] [SEP]
  * by using an [inline bot](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots). [CLS] [SEP]
  * by participating in a group with a bot. [CLS] [SEP]
  * by pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot. [CLS] [SEP]
  * by paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __6.3. [CLS] [SEP] what data bots receive

in any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get
your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username
and profile picture(s). [CLS] [SEP]

bots can also receive the following data when you **interact** with them. [CLS] [SEP]

  * bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your ip address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads). [CLS] [SEP] 
  * if the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you start your message with the username of an [inline bot](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots) (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] [@gif](https://t.me/gif)) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. [CLS] [SEP] this query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. [CLS] [SEP] we will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot. [CLS] [SEP]
  * bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or [without access](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode). [CLS] [SEP] if the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. [CLS] [SEP] the interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __6.4. [CLS] [SEP] bots are not maintained by telegram

other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are
affiliated with telegram. [CLS] [SEP] they are completely independent from us. [CLS] [SEP] they should
ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it
available to them. [CLS] [SEP]

### __7\. [CLS] [SEP] third party payment services

#### __7.1. [CLS] [SEP] payment information

the [payment platform for bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) is
available to users as of [telegram 4.0](https://telegram.org/blog/payments). [CLS] [SEP]
telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different
payment providers around the world. [CLS] [SEP] it is the payment providers that handle
and store your credit card details. [CLS] [SEP] neither telegram nor the merchants on the
platform (bot developers) have access to this information. [CLS] [SEP] although we work
with payment providers they are completely independent from telegram. [CLS] [SEP] please
study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to
them. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __7.2. [CLS] [SEP] credit card information

when making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form
supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this
information goes directly to the payment provider's server. [CLS] [SEP] your credit card
information never reaches telegram's servers. [CLS] [SEP] we do not access and do not
store your credit card information. [CLS] [SEP] when you save your credit card info, it is
saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider
gives telegram a _token_ that you can reuse for future payments. [CLS] [SEP] it is not
possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __7.3 shipping information

when you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we
send it directly to the merchant bot developer. [CLS] [SEP] we can store your shipping
information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. [CLS] [SEP] we will
delete this information immediately if you ask us to. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __7.4. [CLS] [SEP] clearing payment information

you can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time
by going to telegram settings > privacy & security > data settings and
selecting ‘clear payment & shipping info’. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to remove your
payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment
tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit
card information that they store. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __7.5. [CLS] [SEP] payment disputes

due to the fact that telegram doesn't store any credit card details or
transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or
cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot
developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange. [CLS] [SEP]

### __8\. [CLS] [SEP] who your personal data may be shared with

#### __8.1. [CLS] [SEP] other telegram users

other users of our services with whom you choose to communicate with and share
certain information, who may be located outside the eea. [CLS] [SEP] note that by entering
into the terms of service and choosing to communicate with such other users of
telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your
behalf, to those users in accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we employ all
appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of
your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that
is appropriate to the risk. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __8.2. [CLS] [SEP] telegram’s group companies

we may share your personal data with: _(1)_ our parent company, telegram group
inc, located in the british virgin islands; and _(2)_ telegram fz-llc, a group
member located in dubai, to help provide, improve and support our services. [CLS] [SEP] we
will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of
that personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this will take the form of standard contract clauses
approved by the european commission in an agreement between us and our
relevant group companies. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like more information regarding these
clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __8.3. [CLS] [SEP] law enforcement authorities

if telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we
may disclose your ip address and phone number to the relevant authorities. [CLS] [SEP] so
far, this has never happened. [CLS] [SEP] when it does, we will include it in a semiannual
transparency report published at:
[<https://t.me/transparency>](https://t.me/transparency). [CLS] [SEP]

### __9\. [CLS] [SEP] your rights regarding the personal data you provide to us

#### __9.1. [CLS] [SEP] your rights

under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you
have rights concerning your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] you have a right to: _(1)_ request
a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to
another data controller; _(2)_ delete (see section 10 below) or amend your
personal data; _(3)_ restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal
data; _(4)_ correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you;
and _(5)_ lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities
regarding our processing of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __9.2. [CLS] [SEP] exercising your rights

if you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the
details in section 12 below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __9.3. [CLS] [SEP] data settings

you can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in
_settings > privacy & security > data settings_ (using one of our mobile
apps). [CLS] [SEP]

sadly, if you're generally not ok with telegram's modest requirements, it
won't be possible for us to provide you with our services. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete your
telegram account by proceeding to the [deactivation
page](https://telegram.org/deactivate). [CLS] [SEP]

### __10\. [CLS] [SEP] deleting data

#### __10.1. [CLS] [SEP] accounts

if you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the [deactivation
page](https://telegram.org/deactivate). [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account removes all
messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the
telegram cloud. [CLS] [SEP] this action must be confirmed via your telegram account and
cannot be undone. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __10.2. [CLS] [SEP] messages

  * in secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. [CLS] [SEP] this means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. [CLS] [SEP] as soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as of [version 5.5](https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji), any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. [CLS] [SEP] there is no time limit. [CLS] [SEP] any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in [supergroups](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups) and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. [CLS] [SEP] note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the [admins log](https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution#recent-admin-actions). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __10.3. [CLS] [SEP] self-destructing messages

messages in secret chats can be ordered to [self-destruct](/faq#q-how-do-self-
destructing-messages-work). [CLS] [SEP] as soon as such a message is [read](/faq#q-what-
do-the-green-checks-mean) (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. [CLS] [SEP] when the
timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to
delete the message (photo, video, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] media with short timers (less than a
minute) are shown with blurred previews. [CLS] [SEP] the timer is triggered when they are
viewed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __10.4. [CLS] [SEP] account self-destruction

by default, if you stop using telegram and do not come online for at least 6
months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts
and every other piece of data you store in the telegram cloud. [CLS] [SEP] you can go to
settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will
self-destruct. [CLS] [SEP]

### __11\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to this privacy policy

we will review and may update this privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] any
changes to this privacy policy will become effective when we post the revised
privacy policy on this page
**[www.telegram.org/privacy](https://telegram.org/privacy)**. [CLS] [SEP] please check our
website frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy, a
summary of which we will set out below. [CLS] [SEP]

**march 25, 2019**

  * expanded [10.2. [CLS] [SEP] deleting messages] with data on the new features in [version 5.5](https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji), which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit. [CLS] [SEP]

important changes made to this privacy policy will be notified to you via
telegram. [CLS] [SEP]
