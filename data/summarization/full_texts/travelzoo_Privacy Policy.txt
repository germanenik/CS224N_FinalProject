[CLS] [SEP] our partners are required to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information they receive and/or process on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and thus we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

    * we may also provide data to our third party analytics partners, such as google analytics, for the purposes of tracking usage information. [CLS] [SEP] we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. [CLS] [SEP] to opt-out of google analytics use of your information, please visit: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout;
    * we may contract with third parties, such as criteo, huge data, survey monkey, and flashtalking, to analyze our customer data and/or handle web chat, email, customer services ad retargeting, survey administration, and other services. [CLS] [SEP] these third parties may monitor or record telephone calls in order to evaluate and improve the overall customer experience.

[CLS] [SEP] the nature of this information sharing policy will be indicated on the entry form.

[CLS] [SEP] additionally, each survey may contain its own policies, terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] please read these carefully before submitting to ensure you understand what you may be consenting to regarding the use of your personal information.
