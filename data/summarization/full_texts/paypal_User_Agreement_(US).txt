# user agreement

# paypal user agreement

## about your account

this user agreement will be effective for all users as of november 9, 2020. [CLS] [SEP]

welcome to paypal!

this user agreement is a contract between you and paypal, inc. [CLS] [SEP] governing your
use of your paypal account and the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] it applies to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] paypal
accounts only. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual, you must be a resident of the united
states or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of
majority in your state of residence to open a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] paypal account and use the
paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a business, the business must be organized in,
operating in, or a resident of, the united states or one of its territories to
open a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] paypal account and use the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP]

by opening and using a paypal account, you agree to comply with all of the
terms and conditions in this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the terms include an agreement to
resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to
comply with each of the other agreements on the [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page that
apply to you and the following additional policies:

  * [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full)
  * [electronic communications delivery policy (e-sign disclosure and consent)](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/esign-full)

please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement,
terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

we may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to
time. [CLS] [SEP] the revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless
otherwise noted. [CLS] [SEP] if our changes reduce your rights or increase your
responsibilities we will post a notice on the [policy
updates](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full) page
of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal
accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts. [CLS] [SEP] by
continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you
agree to abide and be bound by those changes. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree with any
changes to this user agreement, you may close your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### opening a paypal account

we offer two types of paypal accounts: personal paypal accounts and business
paypal accounts, both covered by this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

all paypal accounts let you do things like:

  * send and receive money. [CLS] [SEP]
  * buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores. [CLS] [SEP]
  * make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business paypal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a paypal cash or a paypal cash plus account linked to a personal paypal account if you choose to open a paypal cash or a paypal cash plus account. [CLS] [SEP] the term "cash account" in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a paypal cash or a paypal cash plus account. [CLS] [SEP] more information about cash accounts can be found in the [paypal cash and paypal cash plus account terms and conditions](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cashagreement-full). [CLS] [SEP]
  * accept credit card, debit card, bank account, cash account and other payment methods from others. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and
all ids, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that
you use to access your paypal account and the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] you must keep
your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in
your paypal account profile. [CLS] [SEP]

#### personal paypal accounts

if you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends,
a personal paypal account is probably right for you. [CLS] [SEP] with a personal paypal
account you can do things like:

  * send and request money from friends and family. [CLS] [SEP]
  * buy goods and services. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also use a personal paypal account to receive money for the sale of
goods and services and hold that money in a linked cash account or transfer it
to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a cash account, but
if you plan to use your personal paypal account primarily to sell things, you
should open a business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you can also convert your personal
paypal account to a business paypal account should circumstances change. [CLS] [SEP]

#### business paypal accounts

we recommend business paypal accounts for people and organizations that
primarily use paypal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if
your business is not incorporated. [CLS] [SEP] with a business paypal account, you can do
things like:

  * use a company or business name as the name on your business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * allow employees access to some of the features of your business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * sign up for [paypal products](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant) that meet your business needs. [CLS] [SEP]

business paypal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees
applicable to personal accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

**by opening up a business paypal account or converting a personal paypal
account to a business paypal account, you certify to us that you are using it
primarily for a business or commercial purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you also consent to paypal
obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting
agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an
increased level of risk associated with your business paypal account.**

#### commercial entity status

if the activity through any type of paypal account you hold reaches certain
thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are
required by the card networks to agree to a commercial entity agreement to
allow you to continue accepting visa and mastercard payments. [CLS] [SEP] in this case,
these [commercial entity
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/ceagreement-full) will
apply to any payment processed by paypal on your behalf and will form part of
this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

### closing your paypal account

you may close your paypal account and terminate your relationship with us at
any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related
to your paypal account even after the paypal account is closed. [CLS] [SEP] when you close
your paypal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions. [CLS] [SEP]
if you have a cash account linked to a personal paypal account, you must
withdraw or transfer any funds held in your cash account before closing your
personal paypal account, and closing a personal paypal account will result in
paypal automatically closing any linked cash account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a business
paypal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business
paypal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required
identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required
identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your
business paypal account to a linked bank account or debit card. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot
withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased
through [paypal digital gifts](https://www.paypal-gifts.com) and linked to
your personal or business paypal account as payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] however, even
without your paypal account, you can still use the codes you received by email
when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases. [CLS] [SEP]

in certain cases, you may not close your paypal account, including:

  * to evade an investigation. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your paypal account has a negative balance. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your paypal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve. [CLS] [SEP]

### link or unlink a payment method

you can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit
card, a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] bank account or paypal credit to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you can
also link a cash account to your personal paypal account as a payment method
and unlink the cash account by withdrawing all funds and closing it. [CLS] [SEP] please
keep your payment method information current (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] credit card number and
expiration date). [CLS] [SEP] if this information changes, we may update it using
information and third party sources available to us without any action on your
part. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove
your payment method from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if we update your payment
method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method. [CLS] [SEP]
you may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is
valid and that you are the card owner. [CLS] [SEP] to do this, we will charge $1.95 to the
card. [CLS] [SEP] after the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to
the card. [CLS] [SEP]

### receiving funds, holding a balance or transferring funds

#### personal paypal accounts

money sent to your personal paypal account cannot be held as a balance in your
personal paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] when you receive money to your personal paypal
account, you can:

  * transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal paypal account for free;
  * transfer the money via an instant transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal paypal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the [fees for transferring funds (for personal paypal accounts)](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#transfers) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;
  * request paypal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal). [CLS] [SEP] if you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked cash account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50. [CLS] [SEP] we will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;
  * open a cash account to hold the money as a balance in your cash account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members. [CLS] [SEP] a cash account is separate account from your personal paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if you open a cash account, we will automatically link your cash account to your personal paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] more information about cash accounts can be found in the [paypal cash and paypal cash plus account terms and conditions](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cashagreement-full). [CLS] [SEP]

you also cannot transfer money to your personal paypal account to be held as a
balance in your personal paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you will need to open a cash account
to hold the money as a balance in your cash account, which can be used for
purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members. [CLS] [SEP] more information
about cash accounts can be found in the [paypal cash and paypal cash plus
account terms and
conditions](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cashagreement-full). [CLS] [SEP]

except as provided below, any balance in your cash account and any funds sent
to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit
card if you do not have a cash account represents an unsecured claim against
paypal and is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic). [CLS] [SEP]

paypal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits. [CLS] [SEP] you will not receive
any interest on the funds held with paypal. [CLS] [SEP] paypal combines your paypal funds
with the paypal funds of other paypal users and invests those funds in liquid
investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws. [CLS] [SEP] paypal owns the
interest or other earnings on these investments. [CLS] [SEP] these pooled amounts are held
apart from paypal's corporate funds, and paypal will neither use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have a paypal cash card debit card as part of a cash account, have
enrolled in direct deposit, or have established goals in paypal, such funds
will have pass-through fdic insurance as further detailed in the [paypal cash
and paypal cash plus account terms and
conditions](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cashagreement-full). [CLS] [SEP]



#### business paypal accounts

money sent to a business paypal account can be held directly as balance in the
business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] the balance functionality in your business paypal
account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the
required identifying information that you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP]

the required identifying information is:

  * for sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number; or
  * for other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence. [CLS] [SEP]

if we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in
your business paypal account can only be held in your business paypal account
and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request
paypal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of
$1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal). [CLS] [SEP] your balance
may also be used to fund payments or money owed to paypal, such as payments on
your paypal working capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]

if we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be
held in your business paypal account, transferred to a linked bank account or
debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have a business paypal account and we have verified the required
identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money
to the balance of your business paypal account from any bank account linked to
your business paypal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your
bank account. [CLS] [SEP] if we have not verified the required identifying information
that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a
business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

you can withdraw balance from your business paypal account by:

  * transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business paypal account for free,
  * transferring it via an instant transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business paypal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the [fees for transferring balance (for business paypal accounts)](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#transfers) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,
  * withdrawing it from an atm (automated teller machine) if you have a paypal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or
  * requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal). [CLS] [SEP] if you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business paypal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50. [CLS] [SEP] we will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you. [CLS] [SEP]

any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim
against paypal and is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation
(fdic). [CLS] [SEP]

paypal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits. [CLS] [SEP] you will not receive
any interest on the funds held with paypal. [CLS] [SEP] paypal combines your paypal funds
with the paypal funds of other paypal users and invests those funds in liquid
investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws. [CLS] [SEP] paypal owns the
interest or other earnings on these investments. [CLS] [SEP] however, the claim against
paypal represented by your paypal funds is not secured by these investments
and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in
these investments. [CLS] [SEP] these pooled amounts are held apart from paypal's corporate
funds, and paypal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. [CLS] [SEP]



#### restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from paypal accounts

to protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain
situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the
withdrawal or if other payments to your paypal account have been subject to a
reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or [dispute
by a buyer](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-
full#purchase-protection)). [CLS] [SEP] if we place a [limitation
](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#limitations)on
your paypal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an
associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal
from your paypal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the
withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is
fully paid off. [CLS] [SEP]

we may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit
by logging into your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] completing two out of three of the
following steps can help us verify your paypal account, which may allow us to
remove any withdrawal cap:

  * verifying your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * linking and confirming your credit or debit card information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * providing your social security number. [CLS] [SEP]

### managing your money in multiple currencies

#### holding currency other than u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars

your balance in your business paypal account or in your cash account, if you
have one, may be held in currencies other than u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP]

if you hold a balance in your business paypal account or in your cash account:

  * we may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency. [CLS] [SEP] if you convert funds in your account, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our [currency conversion spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-transaction-fees)) will be used. [CLS] [SEP] we may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may only withdraw the funds in u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP] in order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's currency conversion rate, including our [currency conversion spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-transaction-fees), will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

to receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to
accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business paypal
account or in your cash account, in that currency or convert the money into
another currency. [CLS] [SEP] certain currencies can only be received by converting the
money into another currency that paypal allows you to hold. [CLS] [SEP] if the money is
converted, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our [currency
conversion spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-
fees#standard-transaction-fees)) will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple
currencies in a paypal cash account or business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes,
conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that paypal
determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on
currency conversion rates. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction
we determine to violate this policy. [CLS] [SEP]



#### how we convert currency

if paypal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange
rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. [CLS] [SEP] the transaction exchange rate
is adjusted regularly and includes a [currency conversion
spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees) applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form
the rate applicable to your conversion. [CLS] [SEP] the base exchange rate is based on
rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior
business day; or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant
government reference rate(s). [CLS] [SEP]

for some uses of your paypal accounts, paypal may determine currency
conversion is necessary. [CLS] [SEP] the applicable currency conversion spread can be
found on our fees page under the heading [currency
conversion](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees). [CLS] [SEP]



#### currency conversion choices

when your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and paypal determines a
currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize paypal to
convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] you may
have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if
applicable for that card issuer and network. [CLS] [SEP] currency preference selections
may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency
is used for the transaction, whether paypal or your card issuer performs the
conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be
made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will
determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your cash
account balance, business paypal account balance or linked bank account is the
payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

### account statements

you have the right to receive an account statement showing your paypal account
activity. [CLS] [SEP] you may view your paypal account statement by logging into your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a cash account linked to your personal paypal
account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your
personal paypal account and an additional statement showing only transactions
involving your cash account. [CLS] [SEP]

## sending money and buying

### sending money to a friend or family member

#### sending money

you can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature
in your paypal account (sometimes called "personal payments" or "peer-to-
peer/p2p payments"). [CLS] [SEP] you can send money to a friend or family member even if
they don't have a paypal account at the time you send them money, using their
email address or mobile number in any currency that paypal supports, and you
can choose which payment method you want to use. [CLS] [SEP] if the person to whom you are
sending money does not have a paypal account, they can claim it by opening a
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP]

we may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send,
including money you send for purchases. [CLS] [SEP] you can view any sending limit by
logging into your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

when you send money to a friend or family member who has a paypal account, one
of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money. [CLS] [SEP] if they
decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged)
will be refunded to:

  * the original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, paypal credit, a cash account, or balance in a business paypal account as the payment method, or
  * the balance in your business paypal account or the balance in your cash account linked to your personal paypal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you do not have a cash account linked to your personal paypal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under receiving funds, holding a balance or transferring funds for personal paypal accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

### fees for sending money to friends and family

the fees applicable to sending money can be found on our [fees for sending
money to friends and family
page](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#sending-friends-
family) and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a
transaction to send money to a friend or family member. [CLS] [SEP] if you convert money
in your cash account balance or in your business paypal account balance from
one currency to another before sending money, paypal's transaction exchange
rate (including our [currency conversion
spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees)) will be used. [CLS] [SEP] if you use your credit card as the payment
method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your
card issuer. [CLS] [SEP]

if you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-paypal)
website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party
will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee. [CLS] [SEP] this will be disclosed
to you by the third party before the payment is initiated. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also use the send money feature in your paypal account to pay for
goods or services. [CLS] [SEP] you will not be charged any transaction fee for sending
money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the "send money to
pay for goods and services" feature in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, the
seller will pay a fee. [CLS] [SEP] you must not use the "send money to a friend or family
member" feature in your paypal account when you are paying for goods or
services. [CLS] [SEP]

### buying something from, or returning something to, a seller who accepts
paypal



#### how to buy something

you can buy something from a seller who accepts paypal, in any currency that
the seller accepts and that paypal supports using any payment method linked to
your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] this includes, for example:

  * buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting paypal as your payment method at checkout. [CLS] [SEP]
  * sending money to a seller for goods or services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * using your paypal account to buy something at a seller's physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * using your paypal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a qr code, subject to certain limitations. [CLS] [SEP]

if the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does
not already have a paypal account, they can claim your payment by opening a
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if they don't open a paypal account within 30 days, your
purchase will be refunded. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to manage risk, paypal may limit the payment methods available for a
transaction when you buy something. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, payment methods may be
limited for certain sellers or if you make a paypal payment through certain
third party websites or applications. [CLS] [SEP]

when you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts paypal, some sellers may
take up to 30 days to complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] in these instances, your
payment may appear as a pending order in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] in that case,
your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes
the transaction (but no longer than 30 days). [CLS] [SEP] if you used a debit or credit
card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a
pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or
receive a completed transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if your payment requires a currency
conversion by us, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including a [currency
conversion spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-
fees#standard-transaction-fees)) will be used, and may be the rate at the time
the payment is processed. [CLS] [SEP]



#### fees

when you buy something from a seller who accepts paypal you don't pay a fee to
paypal. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, paypal's
transaction exchange rate (including our [currency conversion
spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees)) will be used. [CLS] [SEP] your debit or credit card issuer may also
charge you a separate fee for non-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition you may be required to pay a fee to paypal if you are making a
purchase using paypal [business
payments](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/business-payments-
agreement) and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay
the fee. [CLS] [SEP]



#### payment review

when paypal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the
transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed. [CLS] [SEP] when this happens,
paypal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay
shipping of the item. [CLS] [SEP] as a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you
purchased. [CLS] [SEP] if we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct
them to ship the item. [CLS] [SEP] if we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it
and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other
action. [CLS] [SEP]



#### automatic payments

you can agree with a seller who accepts paypal to use paypal as the payment
method for future purchases with that seller. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement is between you
and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or
sporadic basis. [CLS] [SEP] examples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you
either with a seller or with paypal include those that paypal calls a "billing
agreement," "subscription," "recurring payment," "reference transaction,"
"preauthorized transfer" or "preapproved payment."

if you have a personal paypal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic
payment up to 3 **business days** before the date of the next scheduled
payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the [**paypal
help center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/home), or by calling paypal
at (888) 221-1161. [CLS] [SEP]

once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under
your agreement with that seller will be stopped. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel an automatic
payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have
additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you
receive but have not paid for. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to paypal, that
permits a seller to take or receive payments from your paypal account on a
regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine
billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right
to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at
least 10 days before the transfer is made. [CLS] [SEP] if the seller provides the option,
you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your
automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the
seller. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have authorized an automatic payment and paypal performs currency
conversion for an automatic payment transaction, paypal will use the
transaction exchange rate (including paypal's [**currency conversion
spread**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees)) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is
processed. [CLS] [SEP]



#### refunds

when you buy something from a seller online using paypal and the transaction
is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original
payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit
card, paypal credit, or a balance in your cash account or business paypal
account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you used a bank account linked to a personal paypal account as the payment
method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank
account. [CLS] [SEP] if we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked
cash account if you have one. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not have a cash account, the money
will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer
methods under receiving funds, holding a balance or transferring funds for
personal paypal accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

if you used a bank account linked to a business paypal account as the payment
method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank
account. [CLS] [SEP] if we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance
in your business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

for purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using
your personal paypal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the
money will be refunded to your cash account if you have one. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not
have a cash account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one
of the available transfer methods under receiving funds, holding a balance or
transferring funds for personal paypal accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

for purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using
your business paypal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the
money will be refunded to your balance in your business paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you used pay with rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be
processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your
issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward
balance. [CLS] [SEP]

if paypal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is
issued:

  * within 1 day of the date of the original payment, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including a [**currency conversion spread**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-transaction-fees)) used at the time of the original payment will apply. [CLS] [SEP]
  * beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including a [**currency conversion spread**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-transaction-fees)) on the date of the refund will apply. [CLS] [SEP]

money will be refunded in the currency you paid; or if we are unable to refund
in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency; or we are unable
to refund in your primary holding currency, then in u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP]

### payment method used for my transaction



#### selecting a preferred payment method

you can choose any of the payment methods in your paypal account as your
preferred payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you can select a preferred payment method in your
account preferences on [**www.paypal.com**](https://www.paypal.com/) or in the
paypal app. [CLS] [SEP] there may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be
used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired. [CLS] [SEP]

you can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-
store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as
described below. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary
method of payment. [CLS] [SEP]

if no preferred payment method, it's still your choice. [CLS] [SEP]

the availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that
particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the
transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment
method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including
the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] you can also click on the "manage" link to see all of your
available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method
during the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]



#### backup payment method

certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method
be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is
unavailable. [CLS] [SEP] in those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to
you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] note
that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store
or automatic payments. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal determines currency conversion is necessary
for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be
able to separately choose whether paypal or your card issuer performs the
currency conversion on your backup payment method. [CLS] [SEP]



#### sending money to friends and family

when you send money to friends and family within the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] using balance in
your cash account linked to your personal paypal account, the balance in your
business paypal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always
show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment
method for your online purchases. [CLS] [SEP] remember, you always have the choice to
select any payment method in your paypal account by clicking the "change" link
on the send money page. [CLS] [SEP] if you select a payment method with a fee, we will
always show you the fee before you send money. [CLS] [SEP]



#### automatic payments

some sellers allow you to store paypal as the way you pay when making
purchases on their site, so you can check out faster. [CLS] [SEP] often, this entails
creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we
charge your paypal account each time you make a purchase. [CLS] [SEP] to help minimize
disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your payment method
information; see link or unlink a payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

when you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option
to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you can review, set,
or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in
your account settings on paypal.com. [CLS] [SEP]

your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used
for transactions with that seller. [CLS] [SEP] if you have available balance in a linked
cash or cash plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred
payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment
agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment
agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has
insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if
applicable: 1. [CLS] [SEP] cash account (if one is linked to your personal paypal account)
or balance in your business paypal account (if we've been able to verify the
**required identifying information** you provide to us); 2. [CLS] [SEP] bank account; 3. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal co-branded debit card; 4. [CLS] [SEP] paypal co-branded credit card; 5. [CLS] [SEP] debit card;
6. [CLS] [SEP] credit card; and 7. [CLS] [SEP] e-check. [CLS] [SEP] this is also the order of payment methods that
will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller
agreement is unavailable. [CLS] [SEP]



#### bank account transfers

when you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing paypal to
initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] for these
transactions, paypal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in
the amount you specify. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize paypal to try this transfer again if the
initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use your paypal account to pay for an item and you select your bank
account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your paypal
account is issued to you by paypal and not your bank. [CLS] [SEP] the terms, benefits, and
protections associated with your paypal account may vary from those that apply
to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP] if you use your paypal account to make a purchase that
exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft
fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, the
liability limits applicable to your paypal account may differ from those
applicable to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]



#### e-check

e-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment
method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction
is processed from the bank. [CLS] [SEP] this process usually takes 3-5 business days, but
this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account
located outside the united states. [CLS] [SEP]



#### pay with rewards

paypal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s)
when making a purchase with your paypal account through paypal's pay with
rewards program. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may share with and receive information from your
issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards
when using paypal's pay with rewards program. [CLS] [SEP] the exchange of this information
is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the pay with rewards
redemption option. [CLS] [SEP]

all pay with rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card
agreement with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] pay with rewards is only available for
eligible purchases with certain merchants, and paypal or your issuer may
limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in
accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement. [CLS] [SEP] your issuer
determines the value of rewards redeemed through paypal and available
redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit). [CLS] [SEP]

there may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment. [CLS] [SEP] only
rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used. [CLS] [SEP] because your
reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to
redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize paypal to charge up to the
full payment amount to your associated card if that happens. [CLS] [SEP] for more
information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see [about payment
methods](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/popup/about-payment-methods). [CLS] [SEP]



#### debit card processing

paypal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through
either the atm debit network or the visa, mastercard or discover network. [CLS] [SEP] if
we process your debit or prepaid card through an atm debit network, we may
provide you with the opportunity to switch to a visa, mastercard or discover
network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through
your paypal account profile. [CLS] [SEP]

### loyalty cards

if you use the paypal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty
card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] when you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your
paypal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller's loyalty
card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant
by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the
point of sale. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your
loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary. [CLS] [SEP] it is
also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which
you are entitled. [CLS] [SEP] paypal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card
account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or
associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the
card. [CLS] [SEP]

### paypal's purchase protection program

when you buy something from a seller who accepts paypal, you may be eligible
for a refund under paypal's purchase protection program. [CLS] [SEP] when applicable,
paypal's purchase protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the
full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if
any. [CLS] [SEP] paypal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies
for the purchase protection program. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's original determination is
considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with
paypal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of
the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-
making process. [CLS] [SEP]

important: you may be required to return the item to the seller or other party
we specify as part of the settlement of your claim. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's purchase
protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return
shipping costs that you may incur. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's purchase protection program may apply when you encounter these
specific problems with a transaction:

  * you didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an "item not received" claim), or
  * you received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a "significantly not as described" claim). [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that a transaction made through your paypal account was not
authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the purchase
protection program, and is described below under liability for unauthorized
transactions and other errors. [CLS] [SEP]



#### qr code transactions

if you buy something from a seller in person by using a paypal goods and
services qr code, your transaction may be eligible for paypal's purchase
protection program. [CLS] [SEP]



#### item not received claims

your claim **_will not_** qualify for a refund under paypal's purchase
protection program for an item not received claim, if:

  * you collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use paypal in a seller's physical store, except for in-person paypal qr code goods and services transactions, or
  * the seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]

if the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, paypal
may find in favor of the seller for an item not received claim even if you
claim you did not receive the goods. [CLS] [SEP]



#### significantly not as described claims

an item may be considered significantly not as described if:

  * the item is materially different from the seller's description of it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you received a completely different item. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the condition of the item was misrepresented. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the item was described as "new" but the item was used. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] counterfeit). [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was damaged during shipment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such. [CLS] [SEP]

an item may not be considered significantly not as described if:

  * the defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was properly described but did not meet your expectations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item has minor scratches and was described as "used."



#### ineligible items and transactions under paypal's purchase protection
program

payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under paypal
purchase protection:

  * real estate, including residential property. [CLS] [SEP]
  * financial products or investments of any kind. [CLS] [SEP]
  * businesses (when you buy or invest in a business). [CLS] [SEP]
  * vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats. [CLS] [SEP]
  * significantly not as described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person paypal qr code goods and services transactions. [CLS] [SEP]
  * donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms. [CLS] [SEP]
  * items prohibited by the paypal [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full). [CLS] [SEP]
  * for item not received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location, except for in-person paypal qr code goods and services transactions. [CLS] [SEP]
  * industrial machinery used in manufacturing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency. [CLS] [SEP]
  * stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards. [CLS] [SEP]
  * gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize. [CLS] [SEP]
  * personal payments. [CLS] [SEP]
  * payments sent using paypal to any bill payment service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * payments made using paypal payouts and mass pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] not sent using your paypal account). [CLS] [SEP]
  * items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items. [CLS] [SEP]



#### transaction eligibility for paypal's purchase protection program

to be eligible for paypal purchase protection you must meet all of the
following requirements:

  * have a paypal account in good standing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * pay for the eligible item from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the resolution center. [CLS] [SEP]
  * respond to paypal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested. [CLS] [SEP]
  * open a dispute in the resolution center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP]
  * not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source. [CLS] [SEP]



#### our online dispute resolution process

if you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a
seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the
[**resolution center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-
bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4) to pursue a claim under our purchase
protection program. [CLS] [SEP] you may also file a claim (step 2 below) by calling us and
speaking to an agent. [CLS] [SEP] the steps you must follow are described below, and if
you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:

step 1: **open a dispute** within 180 days of the date you made the payment. [CLS] [SEP]
this might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding
your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to step 2. [CLS] [SEP] we
will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's
paypal account until the dispute is resolved or closed. [CLS] [SEP]

step 2: **escalate the dispute to a claim** for reimbursement within 20 days
after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an
agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] you can escalate the
dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the [**resolution
center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-
view&nav=0.4). [CLS] [SEP] the seller or paypal may also escalate the dispute to a claim
at this point. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction
date to escalate the dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

step 3: **respond to paypal 's requests for documentation or other
information**, after you, the seller or paypal escalates your dispute to a
claim for reimbursement. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may require you to provide receipts, third
party evaluations, police reports or other documents that paypal specifies. [CLS] [SEP]
you must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our
correspondence with you. [CLS] [SEP]

step 4: **comply with paypal 's shipping requests in a timely manner**, if
you're filing a significantly not as described claim. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may require you,
at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to paypal or to a third
party (which will be specified by paypal) and to provide proof of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]

proof of delivery means:

  * for transactions that total less than $750 u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used. [CLS] [SEP]
  * for transactions that total $750 u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery. [CLS] [SEP] if the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 usd at the paypal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed. [CLS] [SEP]

step 5: **paypal will make a final decision** (including automatically closing
any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and
eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided
during the online dispute resolution process or any other information paypal
deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

note that when you are making [digital goods micropayments
purchases](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/digital-goods-
micropayments-agreement), there are special rules that apply and that include
pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the
transaction without requiring you to take further action. [CLS] [SEP] we may limit the
number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the
case, you will still be able to follow paypal's standard dispute resolution
processes described above. [CLS] [SEP]



#### dispute with us or your card issuer

if you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction
through your paypal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you
may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] applicable
card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under
paypal's purchase protection program. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you dispute a
transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid
for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a
significantly not as described claim with us. [CLS] [SEP]

you must choose whether to pursue a dispute with paypal under our purchase
protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] you can't
do both at the same time or seek a double recovery. [CLS] [SEP] if you pursue a
dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction
with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us. [CLS] [SEP] this won't
affect the dispute process with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you pursue a
dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us
later. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to dispute a transaction with paypal and we decide against you,
you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal does
not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's
deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than
the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer,
we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you
have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer). [CLS] [SEP]

before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with paypal, you should
contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the
seller's return policy. [CLS] [SEP]

#

## selling and accepting payments

### accepting payments from buyers for goods and services



#### receiving personal payments

if you use your paypal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or
services or accept donations, you must:

  * pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds. [CLS] [SEP]
  * not ask your buyer to send you money using the "send money to a friend or family member." if you do so, paypal may remove your paypal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members. [CLS] [SEP]

by integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended
to enable a payer without a paypal account to send a payment to your paypal
account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which
paypal will make available to you on any page on the paypal or braintree
website (including any page for developers and our [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page) or
online platform. [CLS] [SEP] such further terms include the [paypal alternative payment
methods agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/apm-tnc). [CLS] [SEP]



#### no surcharges

you agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting
paypal as a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may charge a handling fee in connection with
the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as
a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-paypal
transactions. [CLS] [SEP]



#### presentation of paypal and pay with venmo

you must treat paypal and/or venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par
with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where paypal or
venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile
applications. [CLS] [SEP] this includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position
within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms,
conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks
and payment methods at your points of sale. [CLS] [SEP] further, you must not present any
payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout
experience) from the presentment of any of paypal or venmo services or marks. [CLS] [SEP]

in representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not
mischaracterize any paypal or venmo services or exhibit a preference for other
payment methods over paypal or venmo services. [CLS] [SEP] within all of your points of
sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using
paypal or venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment
method. [CLS] [SEP] if you enable your customers to pay you with paypal or venmo, whenever
you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any
point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer
communications) you agree to display the paypal or venmo services payment
marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do
for all other payment methods. [CLS] [SEP]



#### taxes and information reporting

our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental
assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or
withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, "taxes"). [CLS] [SEP] it
is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments
you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect,
report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority. [CLS] [SEP] paypal is not
responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or
for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any
transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding
transactions that we process. [CLS] [SEP] for example, paypal is required to report to the
internal revenue service the total amount of payments for goods and services
you receive each calendar year into all of your paypal accounts associated
with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in
payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions
involving goods or services through those paypal accounts in the same calendar
year. [CLS] [SEP]



#### your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and
privacy policy

number. [CLS] [SEP] such information must be readily accessible for review by your
customers. [CLS] [SEP]

you must publish a refunds and returns policy. [CLS] [SEP]

you must publish a privacy policy, where required by law. [CLS] [SEP]



#### payment review

paypal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal
determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place
a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment. [CLS] [SEP] if the
payment is completed, paypal will provide notice to you to ship the item. [CLS] [SEP]
otherwise, paypal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to
the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action. [CLS] [SEP] all payments
that complete this payment review will be eligible for paypal's seller
protection coverage if they meet the paypal's seller protection requirements. [CLS] [SEP]
we will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your paypal
account. [CLS] [SEP]



#### in-store payments and qr code transactions

if you accept paypal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the
total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place. [CLS] [SEP] you may
charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have
authorized. [CLS] [SEP] you must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they
request one. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any transaction that you make shall have an
accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use a qr code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a
qr code intended for goods and services transactions. [CLS] [SEP] you must also not use qr
codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for
goods and services transactions occurring online. [CLS] [SEP] for any buyer claims related
to qr code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative
evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating
to the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]



#### marketplace sellers

if you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where
paypal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the
marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for
sales you make through that forum. [CLS] [SEP] any such protections may require you to
take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed. [CLS] [SEP]



#### paypal giving fund

if you are a charity and hold a paypal account, you may be eligible to
participate in paypal giving fund programs. [CLS] [SEP] paypal giving fund is a donor
advised fund (daf) recognized by the internal revenue service (irs) under
section 501(c)(3) of the code as a tax-exempt public charity (federal tax id:
45-0931286). [CLS] [SEP] if you meet the eligibility requirements in the [**nonprofit

#### card not present transactions

whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a
transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the
transaction will be processed as a "card not present" transaction, even if the
buyer is at your store location. [CLS] [SEP]



#### accepting preauthorized payments

as a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through
preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis. [CLS] [SEP] this
type of transaction is sometimes called a "billing agreement," "subscription,"
"recurring payment," "reference transaction," "pre-approved payment " or
"automatic payment."

if you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:  
---  
  
you must:

|

you must not:  
  
get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration
of any such payment. [CLS] [SEP]

|

restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer
has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers
sign up for preauthorized payments online. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 business days
before the date scheduled for payment. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each
preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the
preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an
amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
### transaction fees for online and in-store payments

your paypal transaction fees depend on:

  * the country of the buyer's account or the currency of their card;
  * whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status. [CLS] [SEP] your 501(c)(3) status must be documented with paypal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us. [CLS] [SEP]



#### standard transaction fees

the fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their
paypal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the
[standard transaction fees
table](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees), with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds
on the [standard transaction fees for charitable
organizations](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees) table for the charitable fees. [CLS] [SEP] please note that:

  * we may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using paypal. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide you at least 21 days' advance notice for personal paypal accounts and at least 5 days' advance notice for business paypal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you accept payments using a paypal product (like [paypal here](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/paypalhereterms-full) or [paypal payments pro](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/provt-preview2)), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions. [CLS] [SEP]



#### micropayments fees

you may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and
services through your paypal account, if your transactions typically average
less than $10. [CLS] [SEP] in order to qualify, you must have a paypal account that is in
good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not
be processing payments using [paypal payments
pro](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/provt-preview2) and you must
submit an application and have it approved by us. [CLS] [SEP]

if your paypal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees
found on the [micropayment fees
table](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#micropayment-fees)
will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed
through your paypal account, instead of [standard transaction
fees](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees). [CLS] [SEP] if you have multiple paypal accounts, you must route your
micropayments transactions through the appropriate account. [CLS] [SEP] once a transaction
is processed, paypal will not re-route the transaction through a different
account. [CLS] [SEP]



#### paypal payouts and mass pay fees

paypal's payouts and mass pay services let you send multiple payments in one
batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments. [CLS] [SEP] you may be
able to choose to send payments to paypal accounts, venmo accounts, or both. [CLS] [SEP]
in order to use these services, you must have:

  * a business paypal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits; and
  * applied for and received our permission to use these services. [CLS] [SEP]

we may remove your ability to use payouts or mass pay at any time if there is
a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those
services. [CLS] [SEP]

the amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you
use the payouts service or mass pay service, how you send the payments, and
the currency of the payment. [CLS] [SEP] these fees can be found in the [paypal payouts
and mass pay fees](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#paypal-
payouts) table. [CLS] [SEP]

you can send money through payouts or mass pay even if your receiver does not
have a paypal or venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or
mobile number. [CLS] [SEP] if the person to whom you are sending money does not have a
relevant account, they can claim it by opening one. [CLS] [SEP] if they don't claim it, it
will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days. [CLS] [SEP] paypal is not liable for amounts
sent by you in error. [CLS] [SEP] paypal shall have no responsibility to reverse any
payout payment. [CLS] [SEP]



#### your responsibility to notify paypal of pricing or fee errors

once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity
information made available to you by paypal with respect to your business
account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify paypal in writing of any
errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by
paypal. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not notify paypal within such timeframe, you accept such
information as accurate, and paypal shall have no obligation to make any
corrections. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or
discrepancies are different than unauthorized transactions and other
electronic transfer **errors** which are each subject to different
notification timeframes as set forth herein. [CLS] [SEP]

### refunds, reversals and chargebacks



#### general information

if you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded
or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the
payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or
dispute fee). [CLS] [SEP] whenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, paypal
will refund or reverse the transaction from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if a currency
conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your cash account or
your business paypal account for a particular currency is insufficient to
cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different
currency), paypal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or
reverse the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our
[currency conversion spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-
fees#standard-transaction-fees)) at the time the refund or reversal is
processed will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

if you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the
refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to
you. [CLS] [SEP] the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your paypal
account. [CLS] [SEP]



#### payments that are invalidated and reversed

payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by paypal if:

  * you lose a paypal purchase protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you lose a venmo protected purchase program claim. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for paypal's seller protection. [CLS] [SEP] the card issuer, not paypal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ebay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out). [CLS] [SEP]
  * our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent. [CLS] [SEP]
  * paypal sent the payment to you in error. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the payment was unauthorized
  * you received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

when you receive a payment, you are liable to paypal for the full amount of
the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or
reversed for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] if the buyer paid in another currency, the full
amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the paypal
transaction exchange rate (including our [currency conversion
spread](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#standard-
transaction-fees)) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is
processed. [CLS] [SEP] if the balance in your cash account or business paypal account
doesn't cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the
payment methods linked to your paypal account to cover the amount due. [CLS] [SEP] if the
payment methods linked to your paypal account don't cover the amount due, this
will result in a negative balance. [CLS] [SEP] a negative balance represents an amount
that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to
your balance to resolve it. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't, paypal may:

  * engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;
  * take any or all action as outlined under amounts owed to paypal; or
  * place a limitation or take other action on your paypal account as outlined under restricted activities and holds. [CLS] [SEP]



#### dispute fees

paypal will charge a [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) to sellers for
facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are
processed either through a buyer's paypal account or through a paypal guest
checkout. [CLS] [SEP] the [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) applies when the
buyer pursues a claim directly with paypal, a chargeback with their card
issuer, or a reversal with their bank. [CLS] [SEP] the [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) will be charged at
either the [**standard dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) rate or the
[**high volume dispute fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-
fees) rate. [CLS] [SEP] the [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) will be charged in
the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing. [CLS] [SEP] if the
transaction was in a currency not listed in the [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) table, then the
fee charged will be in your primary holding currency. [CLS] [SEP] the [**dispute
fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) will be deducted
from your paypal account after the claim is decided. [CLS] [SEP]

the [**dispute fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees)
amount will be determined when the dispute case is created. [CLS] [SEP] the fee is based
on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the
total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, for a dispute raised in september, your dispute ratio will be
calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over june, july,
and august. [CLS] [SEP] your total claims include all claims filed directly with and
escalated to paypal, except claims for **unauthorized transactions**; and all
chargebacks from the buyer's card issuer or reversals from the buyer's bank. [CLS] [SEP]

if your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales
transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged
the **high volume dispute fee** for each dispute. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, you will be
charged the **standard dispute fee** for each dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

you will **_not_** be charged a **standard dispute fee** for disputes that
are:

  * inquiries in paypal's[ **resolution center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4&locale.x=en_us) that are not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * filed by the buyer directly with paypal as an **unauthorized transaction**. [CLS] [SEP]
  * eligible for **paypal 's seller protection** program. [CLS] [SEP]
  * claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a standard dispute fee. [CLS] [SEP]
  * decided in your favor by paypal or your issuer. [CLS] [SEP]

you will **_not_** be charged a **high volume dispute fee** for disputes that
are:

  * inquiries in paypal's[ **resolution center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4&locale.x=en_us) and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * filed by the buyer directly with paypal as an **unauthorized transaction**. [CLS] [SEP]

sellers charged **high volume dispute fees** may be required to provide a
remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased
dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for
those actions. [CLS] [SEP]

disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a **standard dispute
fee** or a **high volume dispute fee** , but the claim itself may still be
included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio. [CLS] [SEP]



#### chargeback fees

for transactions that are not processed either through a buyer's paypal
account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback
for the transaction with their card issuer, then paypal will charge you a
[**chargeback fee**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-
fees#chargeback-fees) for facilitating the chargeback process. [CLS] [SEP] this fee with
apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback
with the card issuer. [CLS] [SEP]

the applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] the
chargeback fee is applied as specified in the [chargeback fee
table](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#chargeback-fees)
and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original
transaction listing. [CLS] [SEP] if the transaction was in a currency not listed in the
**chargeback fee** table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding
currency. [CLS] [SEP]



#### impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers

you should read and understand paypal's purchase protection program, venmo's
protected purchase program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with
paypal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar
with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries. [CLS] [SEP]
buyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller. [CLS] [SEP] you can find
information about paypal's protection programs on the [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page by
selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the
corresponding user agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you can find information on venmo's protected
purchase program in [venmo's user agreement](https://venmo.com/legal/us-user-
agreement/). [CLS] [SEP]

if you lose a claim under paypal's purchase protection program in any country,
or under venmo's protected purchase program:

  * you must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases you may not receive the item back. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you will not receive a refund of the paypal fees that you paid in connection with the sale. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the claim was that the item received was significantly not as described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the claim was that the item received was significantly not as described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back. [CLS] [SEP]

if you accept paypal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell
through ebay, then you need to read and understand the ebay money back
guarantee program. [CLS] [SEP] unless you opt out by calling ebay, paypal will treat
ebay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for
reversing a paypal payment made to you. [CLS] [SEP] if the balance in your cash account or
business paypal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:

  * place a hold on your paypal account until sufficient funds become available in your paypal account to cover the amount; or
  * create a negative balance in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

### paypal's seller protection program



#### what's eligible

if you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or
reversed under reversals, claims or chargebacks, you may be eligible for
reimbursement under paypal's seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP] when it applies,
paypal's seller protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase
amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions. [CLS] [SEP] there is no limit on the
number of payments for which you can receive coverage. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing the
transaction details page in your paypal account you can determine whether or
not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's seller protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:

  * they did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their paypal account (referred to as an "unauthorized transaction" claim), and the unauthorized transaction occurs in an environment hosted by paypal; or
  * they didn't receive the item from you (referred to as an "item not received" claim). [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's seller protection program may also apply when a transaction is
reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded
payment is reversed by the buyer's bank. [CLS] [SEP]

this section describes paypal's seller protection program as it applies to
you, but you should also be familiar with the impact of various purchase
protection processes on sellers. [CLS] [SEP]



#### basic requirements

to be eligible for paypal's seller protection, all of the following basic
requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:

  * the primary address for your paypal account must be in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the intangible goods additional requirements.

[CLS] [SEP]
  * you must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your paypal account for the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for paypal's seller protection. [CLS] [SEP] we therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * the shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person; provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must respond to paypal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the [resolution center](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not respond to paypal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for seller protection. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provide proof of shipment or delivery. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the payment must be marked "eligible" or "partially eligible" in the case of unauthorized transaction claims, or "eligible" in the case of item not received claims, for paypal's seller protection on the transaction details page. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for
the seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will make a decision, in its sole
discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any
information or documentation provided during the resolution process, or any
other information paypal deems relevant and appropriate under the
circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]



#### item not received additional requirements

to be eligible for paypal's seller protection program for a buyer's item not
received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional

  * you must provide proof of delivery as described below. [CLS] [SEP]



#### intangible goods additional requirements

for the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for paypal's
seller protection, the sale must meet the **basic requirements** and the
following additional requirements:

  * integration requirements
  * where you have integrated a paypal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website; or
  * ensure you are passing session information to paypal at checkout if you are integrated with paypal via a third party or if you have a native app integration. [CLS] [SEP]
  * other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model. [CLS] [SEP] we will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed. [CLS] [SEP]
  * paid **standard transaction fees** on the sale. [CLS] [SEP]
  * delivered the item and provide [**proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods**](proof-intangible). [CLS] [SEP]
  * provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount listed in the **signature confirmation threshold table** (based on the currency of the payment). [CLS] [SEP] if the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 usd at the paypal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed. [CLS] [SEP]



#### establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment

**physical goods**

the following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:

    * harass and/or threaten our employees, agents, or other users. [CLS] [SEP]

### actions we may take if you engage in any restricted activities

if we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a
number of actions to protect paypal, its customers and others at any time in
our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the actions we may take include, but are not limited to,
the following:

    * terminate this user agreement, limit your paypal account (and any linked cash account), and/or close or suspend your paypal account (and any linked cash account), immediately and without penalty to us;
    * refuse to provide the paypal services to you in the future;
    * limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the paypal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your paypal account or any of the paypal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money with any of the payment methods linked to your paypal account, restricting your ability to send money or make withdrawals;
    * hold the balance in your cash account, the balance in your business paypal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal paypal account if you do not have a cash account linked to your personal paypal account, for up to 180 days if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability or if you have violated our [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full);
    * suspend your eligibility for paypal's purchase protection program and/or paypal's seller protection program;
    * contact buyers who have purchased goods or services from you using paypal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;
    * update inaccurate information you provided us;
    * take legal action against you;
    * if you've violated our [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full), then you're also responsible for damages to paypal caused by your violation of this policy; or
    * if you are a seller and you violate the acceptable use policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to paypal for the amount of paypal's damages caused by your violation of the acceptable use policy. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars per violation of the acceptable use policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of paypal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to paypal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the acceptable use policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any paypal account you control. [CLS] [SEP]

if we close your paypal account or terminate your use of the paypal services
for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any
unrestricted funds held in the balance of your cash account linked to your
personal paypal account or in the balance of your business paypal account, or
any money waiting to be claimed through your personal paypal account if you do
not have a cash account linked to your personal paypal account, available for
withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines,
penalties and other liability incurred by paypal, any paypal customer, or a
third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or
your use of the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP]

### holds, limitations, and reserves



#### what are holds, limitations and reserves

under certain circumstances, in order to protect paypal and the security and
integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the paypal services,
paypal may take account-level or transaction-level actions. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise
noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with
notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these
actions. [CLS] [SEP] to request information in connection with an account limitation, hold
or reserve, you should visit the [resolution
center](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-
view&amp;nav=0.4) or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect
to the limitation, hold or reserve. [CLS] [SEP]

our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on
confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the
protection of paypal, our customers and/or service providers. [CLS] [SEP] we may use
proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with
your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a
governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such
decisions. [CLS] [SEP] we have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk
management or security procedures to you. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to facilitate paypal's actions described above and allow us to assess
the level of risk associated with your paypal account, you agree to cooperate
with paypal's reasonable requests for financial statements and other
documentation or information in a timely fashion. [CLS] [SEP]



#### holds

a hold is an action that paypal may take under certain circumstances either at
the transaction level or the account level. [CLS] [SEP] when paypal places a temporary
hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the
recipient. [CLS] [SEP] paypal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment,
including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer
disputes, and overall customer satisfaction. [CLS] [SEP] some common situations where
paypal will hold payments include:

    * new sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity. [CLS] [SEP]
    * payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets. [CLS] [SEP]
    * sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

**holds based on paypal 's risk decisions**

we may place a hold on payments sent to your paypal account if, in our sole
discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with
you, your paypal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is
necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements. [CLS] [SEP] we make
decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors,
including information available to us from both internal sources and third
parties. [CLS] [SEP] when we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your
paypal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending. [CLS] [SEP] we'll
notify you, either through your paypal account or directly by phone or email,
whenever we place a hold. [CLS] [SEP]

risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the
payment was received into your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] we may release the hold earlier
under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking
information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our
sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is
challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a
disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below. [CLS] [SEP] in this
case, we'll hold the payment in your paypal account until the matter is
resolved (but no longer than 180 days). [CLS] [SEP]

**holds related to marketplace transactions**

if you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where
paypal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the
instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party. [CLS] [SEP] this is done once
you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in
accordance with your agreement with the third party. [CLS] [SEP] these holds will appear
in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have questions about why the applicable
marketplace or third party instructed paypal to put these holds in place, you
will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly. [CLS] [SEP]

**holds based on disputed transactions**

if a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be
invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your
paypal account to cover the amount that could be reversed. [CLS] [SEP] any of the
situations described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks are situations
that could result in us placing a hold on a payment. [CLS] [SEP] if we determine the
transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold. [CLS] [SEP] if we
determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]



#### account limitations

limitations are implemented to help protect paypal, buyers and sellers when we
notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that
appears to us as unusual or suspicious. [CLS] [SEP] limitations also help us collect
information necessary for keeping your paypal account open. [CLS] [SEP]

there are several reasons why your paypal account could be limited, including:

    * if we suspect someone could be using your paypal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity. [CLS] [SEP]
    * if your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your paypal account and your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * in order to comply with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
    * if we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full). [CLS] [SEP]
    * seller performance indicating your paypal account is high risk. [CLS] [SEP] examples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly. [CLS] [SEP]

you will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can
be removed. [CLS] [SEP] normally, this is done after you provide us with the information
we request. [CLS] [SEP] however, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you
have provided us that information, we may take action to protect paypal, our
users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal
and/or regulatory risks and any other liability. [CLS] [SEP]



#### reserves placed on business paypal accounts

we may place a reserve on your business paypal account at any time if we
believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business
paypal account, your business model, or your transactions. [CLS] [SEP] when we place a
reserve on your business paypal account, it means that all or some portion of
the money in your business paypal account is reserved as unavailable for
withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you
being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business
paypal account or use of the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] we make decisions about whether
to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information
available to us from both internal sources and from third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these
factors have changed over time, including:

    * how long you have been in business. [CLS] [SEP]
    * whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]
    * your payment processing history with paypal and other providers. [CLS] [SEP]
    * your business and/or personal credit history. [CLS] [SEP]
    * your delivery time frames. [CLS] [SEP]
    * whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

there are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business paypal
account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:

    * **a rolling reserve** is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period - meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc. [CLS] [SEP] rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve. [CLS] [SEP]
    * **a minimum reserve** is a specific minimum amount of money that you're required to keep available in the balance of your business paypal account at all times. [CLS] [SEP] the minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve. [CLS] [SEP] 

if we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as
"pending" and we'll notify you of the terms of the reserve. [CLS] [SEP]  
if we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment,
we'll notify you of the new terms. [CLS] [SEP]  

### court orders, regulatory requirements or other legal process

if we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including
garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise
believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or
regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including
holding payments to/from your paypal account, placing a reserve or limitation
on your paypal account, or releasing your funds. [CLS] [SEP] we will decide, in our sole
discretion, which action is required of us. [CLS] [SEP] unless the court order, applicable
law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will
notify you of these actions. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have an obligation to contest or appeal
any court order or legal process involving you or your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] when we
implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order,
applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold,
reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days. [CLS] [SEP]

# paypal user agreement

## liability for unauthorized transactions and other errors

### protection from unauthorized transactions

to protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your paypal account, you
should regularly log into your paypal account and review your paypal account
statement. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to
your primary email address on file. [CLS] [SEP] you should review these transaction
notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately
completed. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
when this protection applies, paypal will cover you for the full amount of the
unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the
procedures described below. [CLS] [SEP]



#### what is an unauthorized transaction

an "unauthorized transaction" occurs when money is sent from your paypal
account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your paypal
account, and sends a payment from your paypal account, an unauthorized
transaction has occurred. [CLS] [SEP]



#### what is not considered an unauthorized transaction

the following are not considered unauthorized transactions:

    * if you give someone access to your paypal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your paypal account without your knowledge or permission. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for transactions made in this situation. [CLS] [SEP]
    * invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]



#### reporting an unauthorized transaction

if you believe your paypal login information has been lost or stolen, please
[contact paypal customer service](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/contact-
us) immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: paypal, attn: error
resolution department, p.o. [CLS] [SEP] box 45950, omaha, ne 68145-0950. [CLS] [SEP]

tell us at once if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made
without your permission using your login information or by other means. [CLS] [SEP] you
could lose all the money in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if you tell us within 60 days
after we provide you your paypal account statement showing transfers you did
not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for unauthorized
transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

also, if your paypal account statement shows transfers that you did not make,
including those made with your paypal login information or by other means,
tell us at once. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the
statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if
we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you
had told us in time. [CLS] [SEP] if a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay)
kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods. [CLS] [SEP]

### error resolution



#### what is an error

an "error" means the following:

    * when money is either incorrectly taken from your paypal account or incorrectly placed into your paypal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * an incorrect amount is credited to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * a transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your paypal account statement. [CLS] [SEP]
    * we make a computational or mathematical error related to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

    * you request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes. [CLS] [SEP]



#### what is not considered an error

the following are not considered errors:

    * if you give someone access to your paypal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your paypal account without your knowledge or permission. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for transactions made in this situation. [CLS] [SEP]
    * invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]
    * routine inquiries about the balance in your cash account or business paypal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal paypal account if you do not have a cash account linked to your personal paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes. [CLS] [SEP]



#### in case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers

notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong
or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or
receipt. [CLS] [SEP] we must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the first

    * tell us your name and account number (if any). [CLS] [SEP]

### remittance transfer errors



#### what is a remittance transfer

you may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a paypal
account outside of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] a "remittance transfer" is a transaction that
meets the following criteria:

    * the payment is sent from a personal paypal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,
    * the payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,
    * the payment is made using the send money feature through your paypal account,
    * the payment amount equals or exceeds $15 usd (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and
    * the recipient of the payment has a paypal account in a country outside the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]

payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting paypal
as a payment option are not "remittance transfers."



#### what qualifies as a remittance transfer error

a **" remittance transfer error"** occurs if:

    * you paid an incorrect amount to send the remittance transfer. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes). [CLS] [SEP]
    * paypal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received. [CLS] [SEP]
    * the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: 
      * we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or
      * the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control. [CLS] [SEP]
    * funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: 
      * extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,
      * delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the office of foreign assets controls or similar requirements, or
      * you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you request documentation or information concerning the remittance transfer, such as information required to determine if a remittance transfer error occurred. [CLS] [SEP]



#### what is not considered a remittance transfer error

the following are not considered remittance transfer errors:

    * an inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,
    * a request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,
    * a change requested by the designated recipient, or
    * a change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided you, if we relied on information provided by you in making the disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]



#### what to do if you think there has been a remittance transfer error or
problem

remittance transfer:

    * call us at: (888) 221-1161. [CLS] [SEP]

    * the name of the person receiving the funds, and if you know it, his or her telephone number or address,

buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction
or is authorized to do so. [CLS] [SEP] paypal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted
or secure access to any part of the paypal services, and operation of our
websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to

interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will make
reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits
involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are
processed in a timely manner but paypal makes no representations or warranties

services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as

waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise, for example, california

at the time of agreeing to this release. [CLS] [SEP]

### agreement to arbitrate

you and paypal agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has
arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the
agreement to arbitrate provisions set forth below. [CLS] [SEP] please read this
information carefully. [CLS] [SEP] among other things it:

agreement to arbitrate  
---  
  
**_our agreement_**

|

you and paypal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen
or may arise between you and paypal, including without limitation federal and
state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort,
fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved
exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court,
except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims
qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on
an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to
arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act
governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized
relief_**

|

you and paypal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only
on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class or representative action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] unless both you and paypal agree
otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one
person's or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
consolidated, representative or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] also, the arbitrator(s) may
award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in
favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary
to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). [CLS] [SEP] any relief
awarded cannot affect other paypal customers. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_arbitration procedures_**

|

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration uses a
neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review
of an arbitration award is very limited. [CLS] [SEP] however, the arbitrator(s) can award
the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to
an individual. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user
agreement as a court would. [CLS] [SEP] all issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide,
except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of
this agreement to arbitrate, or the interpretation of the prohibition of class
and representative actions and non-individualized relief section above, shall
be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association
(referred to as the "aaa") under its rules and procedures, including the aaa's
consumer arbitration rules (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to
arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] the aaa's rules are available at www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP] a party who intends
to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a
completed [notice of dispute](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/pp-
notice-dispute). [CLS] [SEP] you should send this notice to paypal at: paypal, inc., attn:
litigation department, re: notice of dispute, 2211 north first street, san
jose, ca 95131. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will send any notice to you to the address we have on
file associated with your paypal account; it is your responsibility to keep
your address up to date. [CLS] [SEP] all information called for in the notice must be
provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the
party is asserting and the relief sought. [CLS] [SEP]

if you and paypal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice
within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or paypal may initiate
arbitration proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is
available on the aaa's website at www.adr.org. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another
mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or
less, you or paypal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone
or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you
and paypal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-
person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. [CLS] [SEP] in cases where an in-person
hearing is held, you and/or paypal may attend by telephone, unless the
arbitrator(s) require otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] any settlement offer made by you or paypal
shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s). [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all
claims of privilege recognized by law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving different paypal customers, but is/are
bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same paypal customer to
the extent required by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be
final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_costs of arbitration_**

|

payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by
the aaa's rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if
the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, paypal
will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] any request for payment of fees by paypal should be submitted by
mail to the aaa along with your demand for arbitration and paypal will make
arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] if the value of
the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that
the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the
costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an
individual basis, paypal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and
arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of
accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive. [CLS] [SEP] in the event the
arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be
frivolous, you agree to reimburse paypal for all fees associated with the
arbitration paid by paypal on your behalf that you otherwise would be
obligated to pay under the aaa's rules. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_severability_**

|

with the exception of any of the provisions in the prohibition of class and
representative actions and non-individualized relief section above, if a court
decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or
unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still
apply. [CLS] [SEP] if a court decides that any of the provisions in the prohibition of
class and representative actions and non-individualized relief section above
is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-
waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding
the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from
arbitration and may be litigated in court. [CLS] [SEP] all other disputes subject to
arbitration under the terms of the agreement to arbitrate shall be arbitrated
under its terms. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_opt-out procedure_**

|

if you are a new paypal customer, you can choose to reject this agreement to
arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice. [CLS] [SEP] the opt-out notice must be
postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement
for the first time. [CLS] [SEP] you must mail the opt-out notice to paypal, inc., attn:
litigation department, 2211 north first street, san jose, ca 95131. [CLS] [SEP]

for your convenience, we are providing an [opt-out
notice](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/pp-optout) form you must
complete and mail to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] you must complete
this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name,
address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the paypal
account(s) to which the opt-out applies. [CLS] [SEP] you must sign the opt-out notice for
it to be effective. [CLS] [SEP] this procedure is the only way you can opt out of the
agreement to arbitrate. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all
other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply. [CLS] [SEP] opting out of this
agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future
arbitration agreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**_future amendments to this agreement to arbitrate_**

|

notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and
we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate (other
than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in
the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a
legal proceeding against paypal prior to the effective date of the amendment. [CLS] [SEP]
the amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this
agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
we will notify you of amendments to this agreement to arbitrate by posting the
amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of
the amendments and by providing notice through email. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to
these amended terms, you may close your paypal account within the 30-day
period and you will not be bound by the amended terms. [CLS] [SEP]
