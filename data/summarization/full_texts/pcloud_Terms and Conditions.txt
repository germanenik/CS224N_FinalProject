### encryption

among other services and applications, **pcloud** also provides an encryption
service under the trademark **pcloud crypto**. [CLS] [SEP] this app performs client-side
encryption, which means that the encryption process is performed on the user’s
device and the plain text files never leave the user’s computer. [CLS] [SEP] this ensures
zero-knowledge privacy for the user’s data, which means that we, as a service
provider, have absolutely no information about the content users store in
their accounts, such as file names or file types. [CLS] [SEP] the user content is stored
in their crypto folder, which is locked and unlocked using the so-called
passphrase. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud has no access to user’s passphrase, and once lost, it can
never be restored. [CLS] [SEP]

* encrypted content and ownership 

in these terms, **"encrypted content"** shall be used to refer to all content
and information that you store or upload using the encryption service. [CLS] [SEP] all
encrypted content shall be owned by you or the person who made it available to
you to store or upload via the service. [CLS] [SEP] you retain full ownership to your
files, folders, directories, including their metadata (file names, thumbnails,
etc.) and any information you submit to pcloud for encryption purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we
don’t claim any ownership to any of your content. [CLS] [SEP] these terms do not grant us
any rights to your content or intellectual property except for the following
limited rights that are needed to run the service: we may redundantly store or
backup your respective data as set below and we might use trusted third
parties, like our collocated data center, to provide the encryption service. [CLS] [SEP]
you give us the permission for all and any actions that we need to undertake
to provide the service. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, but not limited to, you agree that
pcloud may transfer your data to its servers and between its servers. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud
states that your encrypted content, encryption key, and passphrase used by you
or otherwise submitted to the service, are stored in an encrypted or non-
invertible form. [CLS] [SEP] your encrypted content cannot be decrypted or inverted by
pcloud or any third party. [CLS] [SEP] your encrypted content can only be decrypted or
inverted by you. [CLS] [SEP] when using our encryption service, you undertake that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] you own all rights to your encrypted content and you have the right to give pcloud the rights described above;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] you have paid and will pay in full any fees or other payments that may be related to the use of your encrypted content and the service; and
  3. [CLS] [SEP] your encrypted content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party. [CLS] [SEP]

* global policies on encryption 

in some countries, using encryption services may be limited, restricted or
forbidden by law. [CLS] [SEP] before subscribing to our encryption service - **pcloud
crypto** \- make sure that using such a service is permitted and legal in your
state of residence. [CLS] [SEP] if any case, pcloud cannot be held liable for any claims
that may be filed against you in relation to using such a service. [CLS] [SEP] by agreeing
with the present terms and conditions you confirm that you will at all times
and in any instances hold pcloud harmless of any claims that may arise in
relation to your personal decision to use an encryption service, in this case,
**pcloud crypto**. [CLS] [SEP]

### third party content and interactions

the site and services may contain features and functionalities that may link
you or provide you with access to third-party content or services independent
of pcloud, including websites, directories, servers, networks, systems,
information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or
services, and the internet as a whole. [CLS] [SEP] your interactions with organizations
and/or individuals found on or through the site and services are solely
between you and such organizations and/or individuals. [CLS] [SEP] you should make
whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding
with any interaction with any of these third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that pcloud
shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred
as the result of any dealings you have with third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

further than any action it may take in accordance with notification it
receives pursuant to the copyright and intellectual property notice section
above. [CLS] [SEP] subject to this, pcloud may, in its discretion, attempt to assist in
the resolution of such a dispute, but in doing so it does not undertake any
obligation to do so, and will not be subject to any liability arising either
from the conduct giving rise to the dispute or from any efforts to resolve it. [CLS] [SEP]

_disclaimer and waiver of liability_  
in the event that you have a dispute with any other user of the site or
services or with any third party whose content or services you have accessed
through the sites or services, you hereby release pcloud, its officers,
employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages
(actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown,
suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any
way related to such disputes. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a resident of california, u.s.a., you
waive california civil code section 1542, which stipulates the following: a
general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if
known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor. [CLS] [SEP]

### payment

you can cancel your subscriptions for the pcloud service at any time from your

must enter valid credit [or debit] card or paypal account credentials. [CLS] [SEP] **the
service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (depending on the
selection you make at the point of subscription) and paid on an automatic
basis. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby authorize pcloud to automatically charge your credit card or
paypal account for charges that apply to your account.** all fees are
exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities,
including vat, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes,
levies, duties or vat, excluding only united states (federal or state) taxes. [CLS] [SEP]

if, for any reason, you are not satisfied with the paid services, you can
cancel your subscription for paid services at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

pcloud has a ten (10) calendar days money back guarantee, beginning on the day
you have submitted your payment for the paid services. [CLS] [SEP] during this period, you
are eligible to request for a refund. [CLS] [SEP] if you issue an explicit written request
for a refund within the ten (10) days referenced above, we will process the
refund due to you in full within 30 calendar days, counting from the day you
have confirmed your request. [CLS] [SEP]

we will usually refund any money received from you using the same method
originally used by you to pay for your purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

in case you have purchased paid services through a promotional campaign or
provided discount, pcloud reserves the right to decline providing a refund. [CLS] [SEP]

### links

our site and services may contain links to other websites, or allow other
users to send you such links. [CLS] [SEP] a link to a third-party website does not mean
that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible
or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third-party
website. [CLS] [SEP] you should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of
a third-party website before using it. [CLS] [SEP]

pcloud enhances and updates its site and services often. [CLS] [SEP] we may change or
discontinue the site or any services although we will, in such circumstances,
use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice so that you can make
alternative arrangements for the storage of any user content and we will not
terminate a service under this section during a subscription period for which

user accounts are not transferable. [CLS] [SEP] only the user who signs up for an account
may use the account. [CLS] [SEP] if a user transfers an account in violation of this
section, pcloud may terminate the account and the users’ right to access the
site and services. [CLS] [SEP]

### change of ownership

pcloud may at any time, without explicit notice, change the company ownership,
be subject to merger or sale, partnership or else. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of such change
of ownership, merger, sale or other, pcloud only has the obligation to notify
you through updating the present terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] such an action will in
no way affect your use of the service or the site, or your subscriptions and
accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

### termination

we reserve the right not to provide the site or services to any user. [CLS] [SEP] we also
reserve the right to terminate any user's right to access the site or services
at any time, in our discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if you breach any of these terms, your
permission to use the site and services and your account automatically
terminate. [CLS] [SEP] if pcloud ceases operation, your account will be terminated and
pcloud will no longer provide the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] if your account is
terminated in accordance with this section, you will not receive any refund of
any fees paid for the account. [CLS] [SEP]

reasonable time period, will be permanently deleted, along with the files
inside. [CLS] [SEP]

deleted, along with the files inside. [CLS] [SEP]

### disclaimer and limitations on our liability (for european union users)

pcloud tries to keep the site and the services up, error-free, and safe, but
pcloud does not guarantee that the site and/or the services will be safe or
secure or that access to or use of the site and/or the services will be
uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions or that defects will be
corrected. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud does not warrant that the site and/or the services will
operate error-free or that the site and its servers are free of computer
viruses or other harmful components. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud uses reasonable care and skill in
providing the site and the services, but beyond that, the site and the
services are provided without any warranties of any kind. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud disclaims all
other warranties, whether express or implied, including any warranty,
condition or other terms of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for
particular purpose and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud makes no warranties about the
accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the site or the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

nothing in these terms shall exclude or limit pcloud’s liability to you: (i)
for death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (ii) for fraud or
fraudulent misrepresentation; (iii) or for any other liability that may not,
under the applicable law, be limited or excluded. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to the above, in no event will pcloud, or any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, and agents, be liable to you in connection
with the site or the services (whether for breach of contract, negligence or
any other reason) for: (i) any consequential, incidental or indirect damages;
or (ii) loss of business profits, business interruption or loss of business
information. [CLS] [SEP] any liability we do have for losses you suffer is strictly
limited to losses that were a direct and reasonably foreseeable result of our
default. [CLS] [SEP]

where you use the site or services in the course of a business, pcloud's
aggregate liability (and whether such liability arises as a result of any
breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty,
misrepresentation or for any other reason) will be limited to the higher of:
(a) total fees paid by you to pcloud for use of the site or services; and (b)
[eur5,000]. [CLS] [SEP]

### disclaimer and limitations on our liability (for users outside of the
european union)

you use the site and services at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] the site and services are
provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. [CLS] [SEP] to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable law, pcloud and its officers, employees,
directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and
licensors (referred to collectively as " **affiliates** ") disclaim all
warranties of any kind, express or implied, with respect to the site and
services (including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular use or purpose and non-infringement). [CLS] [SEP]

in particular, pcloud and its affiliates make no representations or warranties
about the accuracy or completeness of content available on or through the site
or services (including, without limitation, any recommendations or other
content available on or through the site or services), or the content of any
websites or resources linked to the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud and its
affiliates will have no liability for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or
inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage resulting from
your access to or use of the site or services; (c) any unauthorized access to
or use of our servers or of any personal or financial information; (d) any
interruption of transmission to or from the site or services or the
unavailability of the site or services; (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses,
or the like which may be transmitted on or through the site or services by any
third party; or (f) any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the
use of any content posted, e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available
on or through the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] you, and not pcloud, are responsible for
maintaining, protecting, and backing up all of your user content and data. [CLS] [SEP]
pcloud will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your user content or
data or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any
of it. [CLS] [SEP]

pcloud and its affiliates do not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume
responsibility for any third party product or service recommended, advertised
or offered on or through the pcloud site or services or any linked website. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand and agree that any material or information downloaded or
otherwise obtained through the use of the site or services is done at your own
risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage arising from doing
so. [CLS] [SEP] no advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from
pcloud or through the site or services will create any warranty not expressly
made in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, neither pcloud nor its
affiliates will be liable under any theory of liability for any indirect,
incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including, damages
for loss of revenues, profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses
(even if such parties were advised of, knew of or should have known of the
possibility of such damages), arising from or relating to use of the site or
services. [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to
you. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent pcloud may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any
implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such
warranty and the extent of pcloud's liability will be the minimum permitted
under such law. [CLS] [SEP]

### indemnification

you agree to indemnify and defend pcloud and its affiliates from and against
any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees of any
kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs), arising from or
relating to: (a) any information (including your user content or any other
content) that you or anyone using your account or your credentials store,
upload, submit, post or transmit through the site or services; (b) the use of
the site or services by you or anyone using your account or your credentials;
(c) breach of these terms by you or anyone using your account or your
credentials; or (d) breach of any rights of any third party, including
intellectual property, privacy, publicity or other proprietary rights by you
or anyone using your account or your credentials. [CLS] [SEP] pcloud reserves the right,
at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
otherwise subject to indemnification by you. [CLS] [SEP] if we do assume the defense of
such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with pcloud in such defense. [CLS] [SEP]

### other provisions

under no circumstances will pcloud be held liable for any delay or failure in
performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes
beyond its reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms, and any claim or action, of whatever nature, against pcloud
arising from or relating to these terms, the privacy policy, the site, or any
services, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
switzerland, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or
provisions, except that the laws of switzerland will not apply to european
union users of the site or services who are located outside of switzerland, in
which case the law applicable to the territory where the user is resident
shall apply. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to the final sentence of this paragraph, you agree that any claim or
action, of whatever nature, against pcloud arising from or relating to these
terms, the privacy policy, the site, or any services will be filed only in the
appropriate court located in canton zürich, switzerland. [CLS] [SEP] you consent and
submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any
such claim or action. [CLS] [SEP] if a european union user of the site or services is
located outside of switzerland, then, for the purposes of any claim or action
relating to these terms, the privacy policy, the site, or any services, the
applicable jurisdiction will be the courts that are located in the territory
of residence of such european user. [CLS] [SEP]

if any provision of these terms is found to be unlawful, void, or
unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these terms
and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining
provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

the failure of pcloud to enforce any right or provision of these terms will
not prevent pcloud from enforcing such right or provision in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

we may assign our rights and obligations under these terms, including in
connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of
law. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms, together with the privacy policy and any additional terms, as
they may be revised from time to time, constitute our complete agreement with
you, and supersede any other written materials, communications, discussions,
representations, or understandings relating to the site or the services or
your use of them. [CLS] [SEP]
