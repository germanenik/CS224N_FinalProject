### welcome to smartthings!

thanks for checking us out and (hopefully!) using our products and services. [CLS] [SEP]
the services (as defined below) are provided by smartthings, inc., located at
665 clyde ave, mountain view, ca 94043, united states ("smartthings", "we",
"us" or "our"). [CLS] [SEP]

**by using our services, you are agreeing to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] we're required to
tell you that if you don't agree to the terms below, you can't use or access
the services in any manner.**

**effective date: april 21, 2017**

please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our
website(s), products, services, mobile applications, iot plug-ins and other
software (collectively, the "services"). [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions, comments,
or concerns regarding these terms or our services, please contact us atâ
[support@smartthings.com](mailto:%20mailto:support@smartthings.com). [CLS] [SEP]

these terms of use (the "terms") are a binding contract between you and
smartthings. [CLS] [SEP] you must agree to and accept all of the terms, or you don't have
the right to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the services in any way means that
you agree to all of these terms, and these terms will remain in effect while
you use the services. [CLS] [SEP] these terms include the provisions in this document, as
well as those in the smartthingsâ [privacy
policy](https://www.smartthings.com/privacy), andâ [copyright dispute
policy](https://smartthings.com/copyright). [CLS] [SEP]

#### will these terms ever change?

we are constantly trying to improve our services, so these terms may need to
change along with the services. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change the terms at
any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice
on the services and/or by sending you an email. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don't agree with the new terms, you are free to reject them;
unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] if
you use the services in any way after a change to the terms is effective, that
means you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]

except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification
of these terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and
us. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what about my privacy?

smartthings takes the privacy of its users very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] for the current
smartthings privacy policy, please click
[here](https://www.smartthings.com/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

the children's online privacy protection act ("coppa") requires that online
service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect
personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from
children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to
register for the services or send any personal information about yourself to
us. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13,
we will delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that a
child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us
atâ [support@smartthings.com](mailto:%20mailto:support@smartthings.com). [CLS] [SEP]

provide a verifiable email address, provide your name, and select a password
or pin number and user name (which may be your email address) ("smartthings
user id"). [CLS] [SEP] you promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated

smartthings user id a name that you don't have the right to use, or another
person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. [CLS] [SEP] you may not transfer
your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. [CLS] [SEP]

you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract
(or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the
services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these terms on your
behalf). [CLS] [SEP] if you're agreeing to these terms on behalf of an organization or
entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these
terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
you will only use the services for your personal, non-commercial use, and only
in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] if your use of the
services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use
the services. [CLS] [SEP] we can't and won't be responsible for your using the services in
a way that breaks the law. [CLS] [SEP]

as part of using the services, you may create connections between various
physical devices (which may be provided by smartthings or by others), third
party services, and the services. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that you will not
connect any physical devices or third party services to the services (or
otherwise use the services) in a manner that could be dangerous to you or to
others, or which could cause damage to or loss of any property (whether real,
personal, tangible or intangible). [CLS] [SEP] for example, you should never connect heavy
machinery, power tools, medical equipment, or other similar devices to the
services. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please visit ourâ [product guidelines
page](https://smartthings.com/guidelines). [CLS] [SEP]

restrictions:

you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any user

the services in a manner that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including smartthings);
  2. [CLS] [SEP] violates any law or regulation;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;

  5. [CLS] [SEP] attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, pin number, account, or other security information from any other user;
  6. [CLS] [SEP] violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords, pin numbers or security encryption codes;

  9. [CLS] [SEP] copies or stores any significant portion of the content (as defined below);
  10. [CLS] [SEP] decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code of the services (except (i) for sample or tutorial code examples that we provide on the services which are clearly marked as such, or (ii) to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you connect any video or audio recording devices to the services (e.g., video cameras), you understand and acknowledge that (i) smartthings use of any information collected from such devices, including audio/video information, is subject to smartthings'â privacy policy, and (ii) you are responsible for obtaining (and you represent and warrant that you have obtained), any and all consents that may be required under applicable local law from all individuals who will be recorded by such devices. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting any other remedy available to smartthings, a violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### does smartthings cost anything?

smartthings reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain features
of the services. [CLS] [SEP] should you elect to subscribe to such features, you shall pay
all applicable fees, as described on the services in connection with such
features. [CLS] [SEP] subject to any subscription agreement or other restrictions,
smartthings reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new
charges at any time, upon ten (10) days prior notice to you, which may be sent
by email or posted on the services. [CLS] [SEP] use of the services by you following such
notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges. [CLS] [SEP]

#### will smartthings ever change the services?

we're always trying to improve the services, so they may change over time. [CLS] [SEP] we
may suspend or discontinue any part of the services, or we may introduce new
features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or
all of the services. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, the changes we make to the services may
cause older hardware devices, third party services, software configurations or
setups to no longer work with the services, and you may be required to upgrade
or change these devices, services, configurations or setups in order to
continue using the services. [CLS] [SEP] we'll try to give you notice when we make a
material change to the services that would adversely affect you, but this
isn't always practical. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, we reserve the right to remove any content
(including any smartapps or device or external service connections provided by
smartthings or by third parties) from the services at any time, for any reason
(including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that
content in violation of these terms), in our sole discretion, and without
notice. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what are the restrictions to content in the services?

the materials displayed or performed on the services, including, but not
limited to, applications, software and/or services that are designed to
operate with the services ("smartapps"), text, graphics, articles, photos,
images, illustrations, user submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing,
the "content") are protected by copyright and other intellectual property
laws. [CLS] [SEP] you promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules,
information, and restrictions contained in any content you access through the
services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish,
broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or
otherwise exploit for any purpose any content not owned by you, (i) without
the prior consent of the owner of that content or (ii) in a way that violates
someone else's (including smartthings's) rights. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand that smartthings owns the services. [CLS] [SEP] you won't modify, publish,
transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as
expressly provided in this section), create derivative works based on, or
otherwise exploit any of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

the services may allow you to copy or download certain content; please
remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn't mean that all
the restrictions above don't apply. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what about information and data that i provide to the service or that the
service collects?

you may post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide content, information,
or data to or through the services in various ways. [CLS] [SEP] any content, information,
materials or data that you provide to us in any way through the services is
referred to as your "user submission." in addition, when you connect various
hardware devices (such as sensors), third party services, or applications
(such as smartapps) with the services, those hardware devices and applications
will in most cases provide information or data to the services, often in an
automated fashion, and we refer to this information and data as "device data". [CLS] [SEP]
you own your user submissions and device data, and smartthings does not claim
any ownership over your user submissions or device data. [CLS] [SEP] you grant us certain
rights in your user submissions and device, as further detailed below. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that the following license is subject to ourâ [privacy
policy](https://www.smartthings.com/privacy)â (to the extent they relate to
user submissions or device data that are also your personally-identifiable
information). [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all
rights to such user submissions and device data and that disclosure and use of
such user submissions and device data by smartthings (including without
limitation, publishing content on the services) will not infringe or violate
the rights of any third party. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to our privacy policy (where applicable), for all user submissions and
device data, you hereby do and shall grant smartthings a worldwide, non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and
transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, share, prepare
derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the user
submissions and device data in connection with the services, and smartthings's
(and its successors' and assigns') business, including without limitation for
promoting and redistributing part or all of the services in any media formats
and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party
websites and services). [CLS] [SEP]

unless explicitly acknowledged or committed to as part of a feature of the
services, smartthings has no obligation to maintain or persist your user
submissions or device data for any specified period of time, to guarantee
access to user submissions or device data, and has no liability for user
submissions or device data submitted to the services that are or become
unavailable through the services. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby grant smartthings a royalty-free,
worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use
or incorporate into the services any suggestions, enhancement requests,
recommendations or other feedback that you provide to smartthings relating to
the operation of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

smartthings does not endorse and has no control over any user submission. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the service and all user
submissions provided by you are at your own risk and you will be solely
responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that if you have registered with us as a smartthings developer pursuant
to our platform developer agreement, the platform development agreement will
govern our use of any code that you submit to us under that agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what if i see something on the services that infringes my copyright?

you may have heard of the digital millennium copyright act (the "dmca"), as it
relates to online service providers, like smartthings, being asked to remove
material that allegedly violates someone's copyright. [CLS] [SEP] we respect others'
intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable
content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat
infringers. [CLS] [SEP] to review our complete copyright dispute policy and learn how to
report potentially infringing content,â [click

any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through
the services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content
originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk,
and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or
content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. [CLS] [SEP] we
cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may
interpret and use the content or what actions you may take as a result of
having been exposed to the content, and you hereby release us from all
liability for you having acquired or not acquired content through the
services. [CLS] [SEP] we can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact
in using the services and are not responsible for which users gain access to
the services. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all content you contribute, in any manner, to the
services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do
so, in the manner in which you contribute it. [CLS] [SEP] you will keep all your
registration information accurate and current. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all
your activity in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP]

the services may contain links or connections to third party smartapps,
websites or services that are not owned or controlled by smartthings. [CLS] [SEP] when you
access third party smartapps or websites or use third party services, you
accept that there are risks in doing so, and that smartthings is not
responsible for such risks. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to be aware when you use any
third party smartapps or services or when you leave the services, and to read
the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party smartapp,
website or service that you visit or utilize. [CLS] [SEP]

smartthings has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in
any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through
the services. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, when you use a smartapp provided by a third party
or connect a third party service to the services, that third party may place
additional terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) on your use of
that smartapp or any associated services, and you agree that you will comply
with all such terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for (and do not
endorse) any third party terms and conditions, or any third party smartapps or
services. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, smartthings will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor
or edit the content of any third party smartapp, site or service. [CLS] [SEP] by using the
services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising
from your use of any third party smartapp, website or service. [CLS] [SEP]

your interactions with third party organizations and/or individuals found on
or through the services, including payment and delivery of goods or services
under any transaction you enter into with a third party, and any other terms,
conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are
solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. [CLS] [SEP] you should make
whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding
with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree that smartthings shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or
damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. [CLS] [SEP]

if there is a dispute between participants in relation to the services, or
between users and any third party, you agree that smartthings is under no
obligation to become involved. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you have a dispute with one
or more other users, you release smartthings, its officers, employees, agents,
and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature,
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising
out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
a california resident, you shall and hereby do waiveâ [california civil code
section 1542](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-
bin/calawquery?codesection=civ&codebody=1542&hits=1), which says: "a general
release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect
to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by
him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

#### what if i want to stop using the services?

you're free to do that at any time, by contacting us atâ
[support@smartthings.com](mailto:%20mailto:support@smartthings.com); please
refer to ourâ [privacy policy](https://www.smartthings.com/privacy), as well
as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to
us after you have requested deletion of your services account. [CLS] [SEP] smartthings is
also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the services or your
account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] smartthings has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation
of any of the restrictions set forth in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

account termination may result in destruction of any user submissions and/or
device data associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you
decide to terminate your account. [CLS] [SEP] we will try to provide advance notice to you
prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any
important user submissions or device data you may have stored in your account
(to the extent allowed by law, these terms, and the functionality of the
services), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical,
illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise
harmful to the rights or property of smartthings. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at
[support@smartthings.com](mailto:%20mailto:support@smartthings.com) â we
will try to help, but unfortunately, we can't promise that we can recover or
restore anything. [CLS] [SEP]

provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these terms
shall survive termination. [CLS] [SEP] by way of example, all of the following will
survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any
limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual
property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what else do i need to know?

_warranty disclaimer_. [CLS] [SEP] smartthings does not make any representations or
warranties concerning any products (except as expressly set forth below),
software, services, information or content contained in or accessing through
the services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy,
copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or
accessed through the services. [CLS] [SEP] we make no representations or warranties
regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or

services, information and content) are provided on an "as-is" basis, without
warranties or any kind, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, or that use of the foregoing will be uninterrupted
or error-free. [CLS] [SEP] some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied
warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] _limitation of
liability_. [CLS] [SEP] to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, under no
circumstances and under no legal theory (including, without limitation, tort,
contract, strict liability, or otherwise) shall smartthings be liable to you

excess of the greater of (i) $100 or (ii) the amounts paid by you to
smartthings in connection with the services in the twelve (12) month period
preceding this applicable claim, or (iii) any matter beyond our reasonable
control. [CLS] [SEP] some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
damages, so the above limitation and exclusions may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_risk of loss; insurance_. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that your use of the
services (including, without limitation, using the services to secure or
otherwise control access to any real or personal property) is solely at your

party claims relating to (a) your use of the services (including any actions
taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of such a claim, suit, or action ("claim"), we will
provide notice of the claim to the contact information we have for your

reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder). [CLS] [SEP]

_assignment_. [CLS] [SEP] you may not assign, delegate or transfer these terms or your
rights or obligations hereunder, or your services account, in any way (by
operation of law or otherwise) without smartthings's prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] we
may transfer, assign, or delegate these terms and our rights and obligations
without consent. [CLS] [SEP]

_choice of law; arbitration_. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are governed by and will be
construed under the laws of the state of california, without regard to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, unless prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP] any dispute
arising from or relating to the subject matter of these terms shall be finally
settled in san francisco county, california, in english, in accordance with
the streamlined arbitration rules and procedures of judicial arbitration and
mediation services, inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("jams") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator
with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial
contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of jams
arbitrators in accordance with the arbitration rules and procedures of jams. [CLS] [SEP]
judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to
arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or
other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

_miscellaneous_. [CLS] [SEP] you will be responsible for withholding, filing, and
reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated
with your activity in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP] the failure of either you

of any further rights hereunder. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of this agreement is found
to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated,
to the minimum extent necessary, so that these terms shall otherwise remain in
full force and effect and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP] you and smartthings agree that these
terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding
between you and smartthings, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous
written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating

provided herein). [CLS] [SEP] no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is
created as a result of these terms and you do not have any authority of any
kind to bind smartthings in any respect whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly set
forth in the section above regarding the application, you and smartthings
agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in
the event that you have accessed the services via your account with samsung
electronics co., ltd. [CLS] [SEP] (âsamsungâ), these terms are further subject to the
terms and conditions of the then-current samsung service terms and conditions,
which you can access here. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any express conflict between the
terms and conditions of these terms and the then-current samsung service terms
and conditions, the then-current samsung service terms and conditions shall
