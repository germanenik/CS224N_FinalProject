(collectively, “site”), or through other interactions with instructure. [CLS] [SEP] by
submitting personal information through our site, you expressly acknowledge
that your personal information will be processed in the united states (u.s.)
in accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

to view the privacy policy for our products, please visit our [privacy

**data collection.**

**data you provide to us**. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information from you, such as first and
last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, phone number, professional
title, company name, educational institution or organization name, and
password when you provide such information to our site or to an instructure
employee, or otherwise provide this information to instructure, such as via
email. [CLS] [SEP] when you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional
profile information, such as information indicating your interest in specific
instructure services. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information about you when you apply for
positions within instructure. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect other types of personal data and
demographic information that you provide to us voluntarily. [CLS] [SEP] this includes
information provided to instructure employees in the course of routine
interactions with them or provided in response to an email from instructure. [CLS] [SEP]

**data collected via technology**. [CLS] [SEP] to make our site more useful to you, our
servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect
information from you, including browser type, operating system, internet
protocol (ip) address, domain name, geographic location, and/or a date/time
stamp for your visit. [CLS] [SEP] we also use web beacons and cookies and navigational
data like uniform resource locators (url) to gather information regarding the
date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you
searched and which you viewed. [CLS] [SEP]

**web beacons** are digital images we use to log information on our site and
in our emails. [CLS] [SEP] we use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to
learn what marketing works and what does not. [CLS] [SEP] we also use web beacons to tell
if you open or act on our emails. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your
computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. [CLS] [SEP] we may use both session
cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies
(which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
personal and interactive experience on our site. [CLS] [SEP]

our site uses the following types of cookies:

**strictly necessary cookies** : these cookies are essential in order to
enable you to move around the site and use its features. [CLS] [SEP] without these
cookies, services like enabling appropriate content based on your type of
device cannot be provided. [CLS] [SEP]

**performance cookies** : these cookies collect information about how visitors
use the site, so that we can analyze traffic and understand how our visitors
use the site. [CLS] [SEP] we may use third party service providers for this purpose who
may set their own cookies on the site. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies do not collect
information that identify an individual visitor. [CLS] [SEP] all information these cookies
collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. [CLS] [SEP] it is only used to improve how
the site works. [CLS] [SEP]

**functionality cookies** : these cookies allow our site to remember choices
you make (such as your user name, or the region you are in) and provide
enhanced, more personal features. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies can also be used to remember
changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that
you can customize. [CLS] [SEP] they may also be used to provide services you have asked
for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. [CLS] [SEP] the information these
cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity
on other websites. [CLS] [SEP]

**social media cookies** : these cookies are used when you share information
using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our site or you link
your account or engage with our content on or through a social media site such
as facebook, twitter or google+. [CLS] [SEP] the social network will record that you have
done this. [CLS] [SEP] this information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities
conducted by third parties on instructure’s behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

**targeting and advertising cookies** : these cookies are used to deliver
adverts more relevant to you and your interests. [CLS] [SEP] they are also used to limit
the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] they are usually placed by
advertising networks with our permission. [CLS] [SEP] they remember that you have visited
a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as
advertisers. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don't want to receive cookies, you can alter your browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] the
procedure for doing so varies from one browser application to another. [CLS] [SEP] if you
wish to reject cookies from our site, but wish to accept those from other
sites, you may be able to choose the option in your browser settings to
receive a notice before a cookie is stored on your device. [CLS] [SEP] by disabling
cookies, you may be prevented from accessing some features of our site or
certain content or functionality may not be available. [CLS] [SEP]

**analytics**. [CLS] [SEP] we use analytics services to help analyze how users use the
site. [CLS] [SEP] these services use cookies, scripts, and other technologies to collect
and store information such as how users interact with our site, how often
users visit the site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used
prior to coming to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the
site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
instructure uses google analytics and other third-party services to improve
the performance of the site and for analytics and marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for more

**testimonials**. [CLS] [SEP] we display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on
our site in addition to other endorsements. [CLS] [SEP] with your consent we may post your
testimonial along with your name. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to update or delete your
testimonial, you can contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-

**use of your data.**

in general, personal data you submit to us is used either to respond to
requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. [CLS] [SEP] instructure uses
your personal data for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, the
following purposes: to create and maintain your account; to identify you as a

investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity;
and to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary
fraud protection or to solicit your feedback with your permission. [CLS] [SEP]

we may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (
**“advertising providers”** ) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on
non-affiliated platforms. [CLS] [SEP] some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that
they are intended to be relevant to you based on information advertising
providers collect about your use of the site and other sites over time,
including information about relationships among different browsers and
devices. [CLS] [SEP] this type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not use automatic decision-making or engage in profiling. [CLS] [SEP]

where we intend to use or otherwise process your personal data for a purpose
other than the purpose for which it was collected, we will provide you with
information regarding the purpose for the processing, as well as other
relevant information, prior to processing your personal data for the new
purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

**disclosure of your data.**

we will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are
described in this privacy policy or with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

**affiliates**. [CLS] [SEP] although we currently do not have a parent company, any
subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control
(collectively, “affiliates”), we may in the future. [CLS] [SEP] we may share some or all
of your information with these affiliates, in which case we will require our
affiliates to honor this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

**third party service providers**. [CLS] [SEP] we may share your personal data with third
party service providers. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share data with service providers
who host our websites or provide email services on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

**partners**. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share your personal data with our partners. [CLS] [SEP] our
partners may use your personal data for their own direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**other disclosures**. [CLS] [SEP] instructure may disclose information about you if it
