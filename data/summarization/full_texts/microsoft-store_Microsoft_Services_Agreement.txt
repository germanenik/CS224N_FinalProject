summary

4\. [CLS] [SEP] **using the services & support.**

  * a. [CLS] [SEP] **microsoft account.** youâll need a microsoft account to access many of the services. [CLS] [SEP] your microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by microsoft and some microsoft partners. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * i. [CLS] [SEP] **creating an account.** you can create a microsoft account by signing up online. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, a third party, like your internet service provider, may have assigned a microsoft account to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you received your microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you create a microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot transfer your microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. [CLS] [SEP] to protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all activity that occurs under your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP]
    * ii. [CLS] [SEP] **account use.** you must use your microsoft account to keep it active. [CLS] [SEP] this means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your microsoft account, and associated services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the microsoft account activity policy at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738> or in an offer for a paid portion of the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you donât sign in during this time, we will assume your microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. [CLS] [SEP] please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] you must sign into your outlook.com inbox and your onedrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your outlook.com inbox and your onedrive for you. [CLS] [SEP] you must sign into the xbox services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] if we reasonably suspect that your microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. [CLS] [SEP] based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of your content. [CLS] [SEP] if you are having trouble accessing your microsoft account, please visit this website: <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=238656>. [CLS] [SEP]
    * iii. [CLS] [SEP] **kids and accounts.** by creating a microsoft account or using the services, you accept and agree to be bound by these terms and represent that you have either reached the age of âmajorityâ where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these terms on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. [CLS] [SEP] if you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these terms and are responsible for all use of the microsoft account or services, including purchases, whether the minorâs account is now open or created later. [CLS] [SEP]
    * iv. [CLS] [SEP] **closing your account.**
      * 1\. [CLS] [SEP] you can cancel specific services or close your microsoft account at any time and for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] to close your microsoft account, please visit [https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278). [CLS] [SEP] when you ask us to close your microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind. [CLS] [SEP] after that 60-day period, your microsoft account will be closed. [CLS] [SEP] please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your microsoft account is closed. [CLS] [SEP] logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP]
      * 2\. [CLS] [SEP] if your microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. [CLS] [SEP] first, your right to use the microsoft account to access the services stops immediately. [CLS] [SEP] second, weâll delete data or your content associated with your microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). [CLS] [SEP] you should have a regular backup plan as microsoft wonât be able to retrieve your content or data once your account is closed. [CLS] [SEP] third, you may lose access to products youâve acquired. [CLS] [SEP]
  * b. [CLS] [SEP] **work or school accounts.** you can sign into certain microsoft services with a work or school email address. [CLS] [SEP] if you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or data is compromised. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree that your use of the microsoft services may be subject to the agreements microsoft has with you or your organization and these terms may not apply. [CLS] [SEP] if you already have a microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access services covered under these terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your microsoft account in order to continue accessing such services. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * c. [CLS] [SEP] **additional equipment/data plans.** to use many of the services, youâll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. [CLS] [SEP] you might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. [CLS] [SEP] those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. [CLS] [SEP] check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * d. [CLS] [SEP] **service notifications.** when thereâs something we need to tell you about a service you use, weâll send you service notifications. [CLS] [SEP] if you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your microsoft account, then we may send service notifications to you via email or via sms (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. [CLS] [SEP] we may also send you service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). [CLS] [SEP] **data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via sms.**
  * e. [CLS] [SEP] **support.** customer support for some services is available at <https://support.microsoft.com>. [CLS] [SEP] certain services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at [www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement), unless otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP] support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or services. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * f. [CLS] [SEP] **ending your services.** if your services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the services ends. [CLS] [SEP] second, weâll delete data or your content associated with your service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). [CLS] [SEP] as a result you may no longer be able to access any of the services (or your content that youâve stored on those services). [CLS] [SEP] you should have a regular backup plan. [CLS] [SEP] third, you may lose access to products youâve acquired. [CLS] [SEP] if you have canceled your microsoft account and have no other account able to access the services your services may be canceled immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

9\. [CLS] [SEP] **payment terms.** if you purchase a service, then these payment terms
apply to your purchase and you agree to them. [CLS] [SEP]

  * a. [CLS] [SEP] **charges.** if there is a charge associated with a portion of the services, you agree to pay that charge. [CLS] [SEP] the price stated for the services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] the price for skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. [CLS] [SEP] taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your microsoft account was registered. [CLS] [SEP] we may suspend or cancel the services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. [CLS] [SEP] suspension or cancellation of the services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. [CLS] [SEP] connecting to the internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location. [CLS] [SEP]
  * b. [CLS] [SEP] **your billing account.** to pay the charges for a service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that service. [CLS] [SEP] you can access and change your billing information and payment method on the [microsoft account management website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for skype by signing into your account portal at <https://skype.com/go/myaccount>. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, you agree to permit microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. [CLS] [SEP] changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * c. [CLS] [SEP] **billing.** by providing microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize microsoft to charge you for the services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the services you choose to sign up for or use while these terms are in force. [CLS] [SEP] we may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription services. [CLS] [SEP] also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription services. [CLS] [SEP] we may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed. [CLS] [SEP]
  * d. [CLS] [SEP] **recurring payments.** when you purchase the services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that service is terminated by you or by microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] you must cancel your services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your services. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the services. [CLS] [SEP] by authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for automated clearing house or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, **"electronic payments"** ). [CLS] [SEP] subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] if any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an electronic payment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * e. [CLS] [SEP] **online statement and errors.** microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the [microsoft account management website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. [CLS] [SEP] for skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at [www.skype.com](https://www.skype.com) (https://www.skype.com). [CLS] [SEP] this is the only billing statement that we provide. [CLS] [SEP] if we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. [CLS] [SEP] we will then promptly investigate the charge. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund. [CLS] [SEP] if microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days. [CLS] [SEP]
  * f. [CLS] [SEP] **refund policy.** unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. [CLS] [SEP] no refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. [CLS] [SEP] this refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. [CLS] [SEP] for more refund information, please visit our [help topic](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283). [CLS] [SEP]
  * g. [CLS] [SEP] **canceling the services.** you may cancel a service at any time, with or without cause. [CLS] [SEP] cancelling paid services stops future charges to continue the service. [CLS] [SEP] to cancel a service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the microsoft account management website. [CLS] [SEP] you can request a refund from skype using the [cancellation and refund form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). [CLS] [SEP] you should refer back to the offer describing the services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the services. [CLS] [SEP] we will process your data as described above in section 4. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel, your access to the services ends at the end of your current service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. [CLS] [SEP]
  * h. [CLS] [SEP] **trial-period offers.** if you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the service(s) at the end of the trial period. [CLS] [SEP]
  * i. [CLS] [SEP] **promotional offers.** from time to time, microsoft may offer services for a trial period during which microsoft will not charge you for the services. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such services (at the normal rate) if microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer. [CLS] [SEP]
  * j. [CLS] [SEP] **price changes.** we may change the price of the services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the services before the price change takes effect. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a fixed term and price for your service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. [CLS] [SEP]
  * k. [CLS] [SEP] **payments to you.** if we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. [CLS] [SEP] you must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. [CLS] [SEP] if you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. [CLS] [SEP] we may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * l. [CLS] [SEP] **gift cards.** redemption and use of gift cards (other than skype gift cards) are governed by the [microsoft gift card terms and conditions](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions) (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions).

  * m. [CLS] [SEP] **bank account payment method.** you may register an eligible bank account with your microsoft account to use it as a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a united states-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (" **ach** ") entries, a european financial institution that supports single euro payments area (" **sepa** ") or "ideal" in the netherlands). [CLS] [SEP] terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your microsoft account (e.g., the âmandateâ in the case of sepa) also apply. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] by registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. [CLS] [SEP] laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account. [CLS] [SEP] by registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
