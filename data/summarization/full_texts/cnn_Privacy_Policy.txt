we take steps to protect and limit any use of it to the purposes for which it
is provided. [CLS] [SEP]

collect information other people submit about you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a friend might
submit information to invite you to participate in an offering, make
recommendations, or share content. [CLS] [SEP] by processing these requests, we may
receive your information, including a recipient's name, postal address, email
address, telephone number, or information about your interest in and use of
various products, programs, services, and content. [CLS] [SEP] some of our sites also
allow users to invite friends to participate in activities by providing their
friends' contact details or importing contacts from your address book or from
other sites. [CLS] [SEP]

**information from other sources.** we may combine information we receive
online with other information, including usage information from our other
sites and our online advertising and media. [CLS] [SEP] we may also supplement or combine
information with information from a variety of other sources or outside
records, such as demographic, transaction history, or personal information,
and we may use that combined information in accordance with this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

**information you provide through social media.** you can engage with some of
our content and offerings, such as videos, games, apps, and other offerings on

social media sites handle your personal information and content, please refer
to their privacy help guides, privacy policies, and terms of use. [CLS] [SEP]

ask for permission to access your device's camera. [CLS] [SEP] if you grant permission,
you may be able to take pictures or video within the app experience or to

rely on camera systems to track movements of your eyes and other facial
features or your immediate surroundings to apply ar effects. [CLS] [SEP] information
gathered from some facial scanning technology (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] truedepth api), is only
used to make these services and features available to you and is only

may derive from, for example, use of common branding elements, advertising,
press, social media reports or other public form of notice. [CLS] [SEP] we require the
affiliate to protect the information consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from
an affiliate that has a different privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] when we do that, our policy
applies to the combined data set. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn about our warnermedia and at&t
affiliates by visiting the [warnermedia affiliates'
page](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/affiliates/). [CLS] [SEP]

**business partners and third parties.** we may also share information with
business partners and third parties (e.g., other companies, retailers,
research organizations, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and
platforms, participatory databases, publishers, and non-profit organizations)
that may want to market products or services to you. [CLS] [SEP] if we share personal
information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing
purposes, we provide you with an opportunity to opt out of such uses either at
the point of collection or through the choice mechanisms set forth in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about your choices, please see our your choices
and controls section below. [CLS] [SEP]

 **linked sites.** some of our sites contain links to other sites, including
social media sites, whose information practices may be different from ours. [CLS] [SEP]
information you submit to other sites will be governed by the other sites'
privacy policies and terms. [CLS] [SEP]

 **sponsors and co-promotions.** we may sometimes offer content or programs
(e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or social media
site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third
parties. [CLS] [SEP] by virtue of these relationships, the sponsoring or co-branding
parties may collect or obtain information from visitors that participate in
the activity. [CLS] [SEP] we have no control over these sponsoring or co-branding parties'

preferences, you may (i) log in to an account you have created with us at one
of our sites to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at
wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com. [CLS] [SEP] to opt out of receiving our email marketing

any marketing email you receive from us. [CLS] [SEP] if you previously chose to receive
push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to
receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app
settings, depending on the type of device. [CLS] [SEP] if you have signed up to receive
text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may
follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may
include by replying "stop" to the received text message. [CLS] [SEP]

for california residents, please see below for additional information on the
choices we provide to you. [CLS] [SEP]

 **ad choices.** on our own or working with affiliates or third parties, we
may present advertisements and engage in data collection, reporting, ad
delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our sites and on
third party websites across the internet and applications over time. [CLS] [SEP] we, our
affiliates, or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, software
development kits ("sdks") or similar technologies to collect information
across websites, services, and apps over time to perform this activity. [CLS] [SEP] we,
our affiliates, or third parties may use and transfer this information in
order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on
and off our sites and across your devices and browsers. [CLS] [SEP] this type of
advertising is known as interest-based advertising. [CLS] [SEP] we, our affiliates, or
third parties may also use this information to associate your different
browsers and devices together for interest-based advertising and for other
purposes like research, analytics, internal operations, fraud prevention, and
enhancing consumer experiences. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or
mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties
that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the [network
advertising initiative
website](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-
advertising/what-are-my-options) and/or the [digital advertising alliance
("daa") self-regulatory program for online behavioral advertising
website](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=en). [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about
interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of
advertising by third parties that participate in the daa's appchoices tool,
please use this link to download the [version of appchoices for your
device](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). [CLS] [SEP] please note that any opt-out
choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based
advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the
collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and
internal operations. [CLS] [SEP] you may continue to receive advertising, but that
advertising may be less relevant to your interests. [CLS] [SEP]

to opt out of our own collection, use, and transfer of data as described above
for interest-based advertising, please visit our [privacy
center](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/opt-out) to opt-out. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that if you opt out, we will continue to collect data for other purposes,
including research, analytics, and internal operations. [CLS] [SEP] you may continue to
receive advertising on our sites based on your activities on our sites. [CLS] [SEP]

you may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating
system. [CLS] [SEP] for example, most device operating systems (e.g., ios for apple
phones, android for android devices, and windows for microsoft devices)
provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of
tailored in-application advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] you may review the support materials
and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more
about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements. [CLS] [SEP]

 **precise location information.** to disable the collection of precise
location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can
access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection. [CLS] [SEP]

business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar
technologies to understand and enhance your online experience at our sites and
through our advertising and media across the internet and mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are small text files placed in your browser. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use pixels or
"web beacons" that monitor your use of our sites. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons are small
strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a
webpage for the purpose of transferring data, such as the ip address of the
computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the url of
the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web
beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web beacon, and the
identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that
server. [CLS] [SEP] we may also integrate sdks into our applications to perform similar
functions as cookies and web beacons. [CLS] [SEP] for example, sdks may collect technical
and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions
with the site and other mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or
device, maintain your preferences, provide certain site features, and collect
information about interactions with our sites, our content, and our
communications. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when corresponding with you via html capable
email, web beacons and other technologies let us know about your activity,
including whether you received and opened our email, clicked through a link,
or otherwise interacted with our content, and this information may be
associated with information previously collected. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop,
maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our sites, products, programs, and
services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to
analyze and report on usage and performance of our sites and marketing
materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other
unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of
our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business
partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates,
business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, market, or
advertise products, programs, or services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies and other technologies also
facilitate, manage, and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on
or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. [CLS] [SEP] by visiting the
site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree
that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of
the site through the technologies described above, as well as similar
technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking
technologies in the emails we send to you. [CLS] [SEP]

 **managing cookies and other technologies.** cookies can either be persistent
(i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e.,
they last only until you close your browser). [CLS] [SEP] check your browser settings to
learn how to delete cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

you may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other
website. [CLS] [SEP] controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of
other technologies. [CLS] [SEP] please consult your browser's settings for more
information. [CLS] [SEP] however, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you
from accessing some of our content or site features. [CLS] [SEP]

some of our sites may use locally stored objects ("lsos") to provide certain
content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user
experience. [CLS] [SEP] adobe's flash player and similar applications use this technology
to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. [CLS] [SEP] flash
cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your
flash management tools by visiting [adobe's web
site](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). [CLS] [SEP]
your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other lsos; please
check your browser's settings or help menu for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

some of our sites may use google analytics to analyze traffic. [CLS] [SEP] you can find
out more information about google analytics cookies by visiting the following
location provided:

uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. [CLS] [SEP] we continue to
review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created. [CLS] [SEP]

see the your choices and controls section to learn how to control data
collection for certain purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

### information security

we have put in place reasonable controls designed to help safeguard the
personal information we collect via the sites. [CLS] [SEP] however, no security measures
are perfect, and we cannot assure you that personal information that we
collect will never be accessed or used in an unauthorized way. [CLS] [SEP]

### how you can access or correct information

to access personal information that we have collected about you online from
sites on which this privacy policy is posted, or to update your user profile,
please log into your account if you have created one with us, or send an email
to wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com. [CLS] [SEP] for california residents, please see below
for additional information on accessing information about you. [CLS] [SEP]

### additional information regarding children's privacy

on most sites, we do not knowingly collect information from children. [CLS] [SEP] on some
sites, we may ask the user to provide us with the user's age information. [CLS] [SEP] if
the person indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by
law, we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] persistent
identifier and/or email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the
child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the
email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. [CLS] [SEP] we
may use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or
notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent
to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. [CLS] [SEP] once
a parent provides consent, we may use any information collected from a child
consistent with the rest of this privacy policy and/or the terms of the
consent provided by the parent. [CLS] [SEP] if a user is under 13, we will not condition
his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal
information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. [CLS] [SEP] if
you would like to review any personal information that we have collected
online from your child, have this personal information deleted from our active
servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your
child's personal information, or if you have questions about these information
practices, you may contact us at wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com, or at
warnermedia privacy office, 4000 warner blvd., bldg. [CLS] [SEP] 160, burbank, ca 91522. [CLS] [SEP]

### international transfer

we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently
based in the united states, which means information we collect will be
processed by us in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] where data protection and privacy regulations may
not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as
the european union. [CLS] [SEP] if you use or visit our sites from outside the united
states, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the united states
of information we collect from you. [CLS] [SEP]

### notification regarding privacy policy updates

from time to time, we may update this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you about
material changes to this privacy policy by placing a notice on our sites. [CLS] [SEP] we
encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you
always know our current privacy practices. [CLS] [SEP]
