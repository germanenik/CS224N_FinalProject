# google terms of service

effective march 31, 2020 | [archived versions](terms/archive) | [download
pdf](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20200331/ba461e2f/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

[country version:](terms#footnote-country-version) united states

## what’s covered in these terms

### we know it’s tempting to skip these terms of service, but it’s important
to establish what you can expect from us as you use google
[services](terms#footnote-services), and what we expect from you. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms of service reflect [the way google’s business
works](https://about.google/intl/en_us/how-our-business-works), the laws that
apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be
true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). [CLS] [SEP] as a result, these terms
of service help define google’s relationship with you as you interact with our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, these terms include the following topic headings:

  * [what you can expect from us](terms#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
  * [what we expect from you](terms#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
  * [content in google services](terms#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, google, or others
  * [in case of problems or disagreements](terms#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re
agreeing to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

besides these terms, we also publish a [privacy policy](privacy). [CLS] [SEP] although
it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand
how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your
information](https://myaccount.google.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

## service provider

google [services](terms#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re
contracting with:

google llc  
organized under the laws of the state of delaware, usa, and operating under
the laws of the usa  
  
1600 amphitheatre parkway  
mountain view, california 94043  
usa

## age requirements

if you’re under the [age required to manage your own google
account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have
your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a google account. [CLS] [SEP] please
have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the
[services](terms#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re
responsible for your child’s activity on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

some google services have additional age requirements as described in their
[service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific). [CLS] [SEP]

## contents

[introduction](terms#toc-intro)

[your relationship with google](terms#toc-relationship)

[using google services](terms#toc-using)

[content in google services](terms#toc-content)

[software in google services](terms#toc-software)

[in case of problems or disagreements](terms#toc-problems)

[about these terms](terms#toc-about)

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/your_relationship_illustration.svg)

# your relationship with google

these terms help define the relationship between you and google. [CLS] [SEP] broadly
speaking, we give you permission to use our [services](terms#footnote-
services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how google’s
business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_us/how-our-
business-works). [CLS] [SEP] when we speak of “google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean
google llc and its [affiliates](terms#footnote-affiliates). [CLS] [SEP]

## what you can expect from us

### provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/provide_services_illustration.svg)

we provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms,
including:

  * apps and sites (like search and maps)
  * platforms (like google play)
  * integrated services (like maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
  * devices (like google home)

our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move
from one activity to the next. [CLS] [SEP] for example, maps can remind you to leave for
an appointment that appears in your google calendar. [CLS] [SEP]

### improve google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/improve_services_illustration.svg)

we’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine
learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with
innovative features, like simultaneous translations. [CLS] [SEP] as part of this continual
improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase
or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop
offering old ones. [CLS] [SEP]

if we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or
if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance
notice and an opportunity to export [your content](terms#footnote-your-
content) from your google account using [google
takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), except in urgent
situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or
addressing security and operability issues. [CLS] [SEP]

## what we expect from you

### follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/ssat_illustration.svg)

the permission we give you to use our [services](terms#footnote-services)
continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:

  * **these terms**
  *  **[service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific)** , which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

we also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to
you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our
services. [CLS] [SEP] these resources include our [privacy policy](privacy), [copyright
help center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [safety
center](https://safety.google), and other pages accessible from our [policies
site](/). [CLS] [SEP]

although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any
[intellectual property rights](terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we
have in the services. [CLS] [SEP]

### respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/respect_others_illustration.svg)

many of our services allow you to interact with others. [CLS] [SEP] we want to maintain a
respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic
rules of conduct:

  * comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
  * respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
  * don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
  * don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services

our [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific)
provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those
services must follow. [CLS] [SEP] if you find that others aren’t following these rules,
many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://google.com/contact). [CLS] [SEP]
if we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in
the _[taking action in case of problems](terms#toc-problems)_ section. [CLS] [SEP]

### permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/permission_to_use_illustration.svg)

some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send,
receive, or share [your content](terms#footnote-your-content). [CLS] [SEP] you have no
obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose
the content that you want to provide. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to upload or share
content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the
content is lawful. [CLS] [SEP]

## license

[your content](terms#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that
you retain any [intellectual property rights](terms#footnote-intellectual-
property-rights) that you have in your content. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you have
intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews
you write. [CLS] [SEP] or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content
if they’ve given you their permission. [CLS] [SEP]

we need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use
of your content. [CLS] [SEP] you provide google with that permission through this license. [CLS] [SEP]

### what’s covered

this license covers [your content](terms#footnote-your-content) if that
content is protected by intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

### what’s not covered

  * this license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
  * this license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    * publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. [CLS] [SEP] that information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use. [CLS] [SEP]
    * feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] feedback is covered in the _[service-related communications](terms#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below. [CLS] [SEP]

### scope

this license is:

  * worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
  * non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
  * royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license

### rights

this license allows google to:

  * host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
  * publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
  * modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
  * sublicense these rights to:
    * other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    * our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[purpose](terms#toc-purpose)_ section below

### purpose

this license is for the limited purpose of:

  *  **operating and improving the services** , which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. [CLS] [SEP] this includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    * for spam, malware, and illegal content
    * to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in google photos to keep related photos together
    * to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [ads settings](https://adssettings.google.com?utm_source=ps-terms))
this analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. [CLS] [SEP] for example, to promote a google app, we might quote a review you wrote. [CLS] [SEP] or to promote google play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the play store. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **developing new technologies and services** for google consistent with these terms

### duration

this license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual
property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

if you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license,
then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a
reasonable amount of time. [CLS] [SEP] there are two exceptions:

  * if you already shared your content with others before removing it. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s google account even after you remove it from your google account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including google search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results. [CLS] [SEP]

# using google services

## your google account

[if you meet these age
requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can
[create a google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441)
for your convenience. [CLS] [SEP] some [services](terms#footnote-services) require that
you have a google account in order to work — for example, to use gmail, you
need a google account so that you have a place to send and receive your email. [CLS] [SEP]

you’re responsible for what you do with your google account, including taking
reasonable steps to keep your google account secure, and we encourage you to
regularly use the [security checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-
checkup). [CLS] [SEP]

## using google services on behalf of an organization

many [organizations](terms#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-
profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](terms#footnote-
services). [CLS] [SEP] to use our services on behalf of an organization:

  * an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
  * your organization’s administrator may assign a google account to you. [CLS] [SEP] that administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your google account. [CLS] [SEP]

## service-related communications

to provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements
and other information. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about how we communicate with you, see
google’s [privacy policy](privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our
services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/content_in_services_illustration.svg)

# content in google services

## your content

some of our [services](terms#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to
make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product
or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you
created. [CLS] [SEP]

  * see the _[permission to use your content](terms#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](terms#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
  * see the _[removing your content](terms#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

if you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property
rights](terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice
of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and
we’ll take appropriate action. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we suspend or close the google
accounts of repeat [copyright](terms#footnote-copyright) infringers as
described in our [copyright help
center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877). [CLS] [SEP]

## google content

some of our [services](terms#footnote-services) include content that belongs
to google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in google
maps. [CLS] [SEP] you may use google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-
specific additional terms](terms/service-specific), but we retain any
intellectual property rights that we have in our content. [CLS] [SEP] don’t remove,
obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to
use our branding or logos, please see the [google brand
permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page. [CLS] [SEP]

## other content

finally, some of our [services](terms#footnote-services) give you access to
content that belongs to other people or [organizations](terms#footnote-
organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own
business, or a newspaper article displayed in google news. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use
this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise
allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP] the views expressed in other people or organizations’ content
are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect google’s views. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/software_in_services_illustration.svg)

# software in google services

some of our [services](terms#footnote-services) include downloadable software. [CLS] [SEP]
we give you permission to use that software as part of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

the license we give you is:

  * worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
  * non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
  * royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
  * personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
  * non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license
terms that we make available to you. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes there are provisions in the
open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please
be sure to read those licenses. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services
or software. [CLS] [SEP] also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of
our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets
you do so. [CLS] [SEP]

when a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software
sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature
is available. [CLS] [SEP] some services let you adjust your automatic update settings. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/disagreements_illustration.svg)

# in case of problems or disagreements

by law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways
to fix problems if things go wrong. [CLS] [SEP] these terms don’t limit or take away any
of those rights. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you’re a [consumer](terms#footnote-consumer),
then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

## warranty

we provide our [services](terms#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and
care. [CLS] [SEP] if we don’t meet the quality level described in this
[warranty](terms#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with
you to try to resolve the issue. [CLS] [SEP]

## disclaimers

the only commitments we make about our [services](terms#footnote-services)
(including the content in the services, the specific functions of our
services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs)
are (1) described in the _[warranty](terms#toc-warranty)_ section, (2) stated
in the [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific), or (3)
provided under applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t make any other commitments about our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

and unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

## liabilities

### for all users

these terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
specifically, these terms don’t limit google’s [liability](terms#footnote-
liability) for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation,
gross negligence, or willful misconduct. [CLS] [SEP]

other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section ( _in
case of problems or disagreements_ ), google won’t be responsible for any
other losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms or [service-
specific additional terms](terms/service-specific). [CLS] [SEP]

### for business users and organizations only

if you’re a [business user](terms#footnote-business-user) or
[organization](terms#footnote-organization), then to the extent allowed by
applicable law:

  * you’ll [indemnify](terms#footnote-indemnify) google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](terms#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific). [CLS] [SEP] this indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees. [CLS] [SEP]
  * google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
    * loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    * indirect or consequential loss
    * punitive damages
  * google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) us$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach

if you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including
[indemnification](terms#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t
apply to you under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the united nations enjoys certain
immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those
immunities. [CLS] [SEP]

## taking action in case of problems

before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice
when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an
opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so
would:

  * cause harm or [liability](terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or google
  * violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
  * compromise an investigation
  * compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](terms#footnote-services)

### removing your content

if we reasonably believe that any of [your content](terms#footnote-your-
content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or
policies](terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could
harm our users, third parties, or google, then we reserve the right to take
down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] examples
include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or
harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property
rights](terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights). [CLS] [SEP]

### suspending or terminating your access to google services

google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services
or delete your google account if any of these things happen:

  * you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific)
  * we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
  * we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

if you believe your google account has been suspended or terminated in error,
[you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695). [CLS] [SEP]

of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if you
do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing
why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving
our services. [CLS] [SEP]

## settling disputes, governing law, and courts

for information about how to contact google, please visit our [contact
page](https://www.google.com/contact). [CLS] [SEP]

california law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these
terms, [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific), or any
related [services](terms#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws
rules. [CLS] [SEP] these disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state
courts of santa clara county, california, usa, and you and google consent to
personal jurisdiction in those courts. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being
resolved in a california court, then you can file those disputes in your local
courts. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from
applying california law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be
governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place
of residence. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/about_these_terms_illustration.svg)

# about these terms

by law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these
terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms describe the relationship between you and google. [CLS] [SEP] they don’t
create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](terms#footnote-
organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

we want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from
our [services](terms#footnote-services). [CLS] [SEP] but not all services mentioned may be
available in your country. [CLS] [SEP]

if these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional
terms](terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that
service. [CLS] [SEP]

if it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will
not affect any other terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional
terms](terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that
doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking
action in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

we may update these terms and [service-specific additional
terms](terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how
we do business — for example, when we add new services, features,
technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal,
regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. [CLS] [SEP]

if we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional
terms](terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance
notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a
new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing
ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t agree to the
new terms, you should remove [your content](terms#footnote-your-content) and
stop using the services. [CLS] [SEP] you can also end your relationship with us at any
time by closing your google account. [CLS] [SEP]
