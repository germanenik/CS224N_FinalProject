have it processed and used for other purposes. [CLS] [SEP] after registration your
personal account will be linked to your company's account. [CLS] [SEP] if your company's

companyaccount administrator can remove your company's licenses by deleting
them from the list. [CLS] [SEP]

configuration of your computer or network. [CLS] [SEP] you can do this by using the
"attach files" option in the request form. [CLS] [SEP] these files may contain user-

content. [CLS] [SEP] it is always your choice whether to upload these files. [CLS] [SEP] if you would
like to upload files, please first view and accept our [regulation on data

department for your request, we will use information about your company's
licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your
companyaccount. [CLS] [SEP] your colleagues may have access to your requests if your
companyaccount administrator manually changes the corresponding settings (the
administrator can view requests automatically). [CLS] [SEP]
