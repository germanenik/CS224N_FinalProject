# attendify privacy policy

## updated on june 30, 2020

## purpose of this privacy policy:

#### last updated: june 30th, 2020

we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of our users. [CLS] [SEP]
we created this privacy policy (the “policy”) to give you notice of how your
private information will be collected, used and shared as you use our
services, including any white-label mobile apps operated, managed and marketed
by our clients. [CLS] [SEP] any capitalized term not defined in this policy will have the
meaning set forth in our [terms of service](terms-of-service.html). [CLS] [SEP] all
references to “we”, “us”, “our”, or “attendify” refer to kitapps, inc., a
delaware corporation. [CLS] [SEP] all references to “you”, “your”, or “user” refers to the
end user of the services. [CLS] [SEP]  

in simplified form (greater detail is below), our policy can be summarized as
follows:

  * we may collect some information about you, as described in this policy, but you have some choices about how much you share about yourself. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * we will not sell your personal information but may share such information with our vendors and our clients in connection with providing the services. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * if we use a third party to assist us, they will be bound to protect your information. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * we may collect, use and share aggregate, anonymous information about our users. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * in certain legal situations, we may be compelled to disclose your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * if you are outside the united states, you understand and agree that we may store your information in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]  

  * we participate in, and comply with, the eu-us privacy shield principles and the swiss-us privacy shield principles (the “privacy shield principles”) regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the european union and switzerland. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] this policy applies to all users of the services

this policy applies to your use of the services, whether you are client or an
end user of the services, including in connection with one or more events
(each, an “event”). [CLS] [SEP] please read this policy carefully, as it describes how we
collect, use and share your information. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing and interacting with the
services, you consent to this policy. [CLS] [SEP]  

if you are an end user, you acknowledge that we may share your information,
including your personally identifiable information, with certain third parties
as specified in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information from and about you

**information you provide as you use the services.** when you register for an
attendify account, you must provide us with certain personal information about
yourself, such as name and email address. [CLS] [SEP] you may also voluntarily choose to
provide us with personal information as you use the services, including,
without limitation, by completing your profile and registering for and
interacting with others in connection with one or more events. [CLS] [SEP] this may
include personal information about you, such as your address, phone number and
company name (if you are a client). [CLS] [SEP] if you correspond with us by email, we may
retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our
responses. [CLS] [SEP] we may also retain any messages you send through the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**information we collect from you passively.** we automatically collect
certain information about you as you use the services, including, without
limitation, through cookies on the attendify website and in-app tracking when
you use our apps. [CLS] [SEP] this may include information about your device (such as your
unique device identifier), your location, your internet usage, and how you
interact with the services. [CLS] [SEP] this may include information about the way you use
the services, the parts of our services you use, any event sessions you may
attend, and third party apps or websites you visit when you leave our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

**information we collect from third parties.** if you are an end user, we may
receive information about you from a client, and we may collect information
from your social media accounts if you choose to give us permission to access
your social media accounts. [CLS] [SEP] we may also work with third parties who collect
information about you when you use our app. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our vendors might use
scripts or other tools to track your activities on our services. [CLS] [SEP] they may do
this to make sure our services function properly. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] we use information about you as disclosed and described here

**we use information to administer and provide the core functionality of the
services.** for example, we use your information, such as your contact
information, in connection with any events or event sessions for which you
register. [CLS] [SEP]  

**we use information to improve our products and services.** we may use your
information to make our website, apps and products better. [CLS] [SEP] we might use your
information to customize your experience with us. [CLS] [SEP]  

**we may use information to respond to your requests or questions.** for
example, we might use your information, such as your email address, to respond
to your customer questions or feedback. [CLS] [SEP]  

**we may use information to communicate with you about your account or our
relationship.** we may contact you about your account or feedback. [CLS] [SEP] we might
also contact you about this policy or our app terms of service, found at
<https://attendify.com/terms_of_service/>  

**we may use information for security purposes.** we may use information to
protect our company, a client, and/or our website and apps. [CLS] [SEP]  

**we may use information for promotional purposes.** for example, we might
provide you with information about new features, updates, new products or
special offers from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if you prefer not to receive promotional
messages from us, please read the choices section below in section 5. [CLS] [SEP]  

### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] we may share information with third parties

**we will share information to provide the functionality of the services.**
these are third parties with whom information is shared as part of the
functionality of the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share information with
external social media services if an end user elects to cross-publish a post. [CLS] [SEP]
we may also share information with our vendors who provide payment processing,
hosting, customer support, email marketing and other services to us. [CLS] [SEP] we also
may share information, upon your request or the request of a client, with
third party services to provide live and recorded audio and video services in
connection with an event. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an end user, we may, upon your request or
upon the request of a client, also share your information (including your
personal and contact information and information about your engagement on the
services such as any event sessions you attend) with: the client associated
with your account, the client’s third-party partners associated with an event,
and with sponsors and exhibitors of the event. [CLS] [SEP] these third parties may contact
you in relation to one or more events for which you have registered (including
through push notification on your device), or for their own marketing and
promotional purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in certain cases, we may also share attendee behavior
information, including how you interact with the services, in connection with
one or more events organized by our clients. [CLS] [SEP] while this information may not
personally identify you on its own, this information may be combined with
other personally-identifiable information, either by us or the client. [CLS] [SEP]
finally, in the event that an event is recorded, we may share the recording
with the client, the client’s third-party partners associated with an event,
and with sponsors and exhibitors of the event. [CLS] [SEP]

**we may share information to comply with the law.** we will also share
information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to
protect ourselves. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we will share information to respond to a
court order, subpoena, or a request from a government agency or investigatory
body. [CLS] [SEP] we might also share information when we are investigating potential
fraud. [CLS] [SEP]

**we may share information with any successor to all or part of our
business.** for example, if all or a part of our business was sold, we may
share information as part of that transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

**we may otherwise share information with your permission.**

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] you have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices

**you can opt out of receiving our promotional emails.** to stop receiving our
promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get
from us. [CLS] [SEP] even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send
you transactional messages. [CLS] [SEP] these include responses to your questions. [CLS] [SEP]  

**you can control cookies and other browser-based tracking tools.** for
example, your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other
browser-based tracking tools. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you block cookies, certain
features on the attendify website may not work. [CLS] [SEP]

**our do not track policy:** some browsers have “do not track” features that
allow you to tell a website not to track you. [CLS] [SEP] these features are not all
uniform. [CLS] [SEP] we do not currently respond to those signals. [CLS] [SEP]

**you can control tools on your mobile devices.** for example, you can turn
off the gps locator or push notifications on your phone. [CLS] [SEP] please note that
turning off certain tools on your mobile device may affect the functionality
of certain features of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] california users

for purposes of this section 12 only, the terms “personal information,”
“collection,” “sell,” “business purpose” and “commercial purpose” have the
meaning given to them under the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (the
“ccpa”). [CLS] [SEP]  

if you reside in california, you have certain rights set forth below. [CLS] [SEP] these
rights are in addition to any other rights you may have under this policy. [CLS] [SEP] if
you have any questions about these rights or how to exercise them, please
contact us as described in section 10 of this policy. [CLS] [SEP] please note that we may
disclose your personal information for business or commercial purposes as
described in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about the categories of
personal information we collect, the sources from which we collect personal
information and how use, disclose and share such information, please see
sections 2, 3 and 4 of this policy. [CLS] [SEP]  

**disclosure and deletion requests.** you have the right to request that we
disclose to you what personal information about you we collect, use, disclose
and sell. [CLS] [SEP] subject to certain limitations in the ccpa, you also have the right
to request that we delete your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] you may submit such a
request by contacting us as described in section 10 of this policy, or by
completing the form on our website for such purpose. [CLS] [SEP] if you submit a request
by email, your email must include “california request” in the subject line. [CLS] [SEP] we
will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP]  

in addition, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared
personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

parties for their direct marketing purposes, except for any client whose event
you have registered for, in which case the client may use your personal
information for their direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] to make a request, please
send us an email at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com), or

policy, we do not sell the personal information of our users. [CLS] [SEP]  

**verification.** we reserve the right to verify any request made under the
ccpa by asking you to provide supporting documentation that the request is
submitted by you, although we are not obligated to verify a request. [CLS] [SEP] you may
also choose to have an agent submit a request on your behalf, in which case we
may, but are not obligated to, verify that the agent is authorized to act on
your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we assume no responsibility for responding to any consumer
requests. [CLS] [SEP]
