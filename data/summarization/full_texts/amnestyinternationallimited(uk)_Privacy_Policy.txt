# privacy policy

### introduction

amnesty international is committed to ensuring the privacy of all our users. [CLS] [SEP]

### legal basis of processing

data protection law requires us to have a legal justification to process your
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we use the following depending on the type of data and
the type of processing:

**consent**  
we require your consent to send you our communications for example to send you
emails to update you on our work and our campaigns and to request donations. [CLS] [SEP]
we will only process your information in this way if you consent. [CLS] [SEP] if you apply
for a job with us and provide us with sensitive personal information
(including details of your race, ethnicity, gender) we will only process that
information with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

**legitimate interest**  
we sometimes share your personal information with other parts of the amnesty
international global movement (see below). [CLS] [SEP] this is done to fulfil our
legitimate interest in promoting our organisation as effectively as possible
and enabling our message to reach people who may be interested in human
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

**to fulfil a contractual obligation**  
if you donate to us or express an interest in joining our movement we will
process the personal data you provided to process that donation or action your
membership request. [CLS] [SEP]

**legal obligation**  
we will process your personal information to fulfil any legal obligations
placed upon us, such as the prevention of fraud or money-laundering. [CLS] [SEP] we will
also process your personal information if lawfully required to do so by a
legal authority or a court of law. [CLS] [SEP]

**necessity**  
for example where you are applying for an employment or volunteering
opportunity with us, processing certain information is necessary for
employment purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**security**  
we take appropriate security measures to ensure that we keep your information
secure, accurate and up to date. [CLS] [SEP] we also take care to ensure that we have
secure systems for processing payments through our payment services provider. [CLS] [SEP]
however the transmission of information over the internet is never completely
secure, so while we do our best to protect personal information, we cannot
guarantee the security of information transmitted to our websites. [CLS] [SEP]

### third party websites

on our website we sometimes have links to third party websites or
applications. [CLS] [SEP] this policy does not apply to such pages or applications hosted
or operated by other organisations. [CLS] [SEP] this includes the websites or applications

these bodies are formally constituted and others not. [CLS] [SEP] we may share your
information with these entities who may then use your personal information in
connection with their activities. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you have expressed an
interest in joining amnesty international or sign a petition, we may share
your contact details with your local amnesty international organisation. [CLS] [SEP] to
the extent that sharing your information in this way requires us to transfer

which, depending on your privacy settings with facebook, enable us to display
our content to our existing or potential supporters on facebook. [CLS] [SEP] we provide
personal information such as your email address to facebook which securely
encrypts it. [CLS] [SEP] that personal information is then deleted by facebook if it does
not match a facebook account or once they confirm you have an account. [CLS] [SEP]

where submitted, your card details may be disclosed to banks or relevant
financial institutions to arrange payments. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of a suspected
