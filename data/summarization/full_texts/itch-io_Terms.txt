### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] transactions and fees

> share (that you set) and may be required to withhold an amount of the sales
> for tax, vat and other charges. [CLS] [SEP]

publishers may set the prices, at their own discretion, for their content and
products to be sold through the service (each sale, a âtransactionâ). [CLS] [SEP] the

transactions which shall be calculated on the gross revenue from the

and taxes through its payment providers, and will pay to publisher the

> for help. [CLS] [SEP]

users may request, and company may process, refund requests if the purchased
content cannot run, some other issue prevents access to the content, or the
product does not accurately represent what was advertised. [CLS] [SEP] for technical
issues, company will direct users to the publisher to first try to resolve
such issues. [CLS] [SEP] to request a refund, please [contact support](/support) with your
purchase information. [CLS] [SEP] for content selling third party external keys (e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
steam keys), company may require the publisher to confirm cancellation of the
key before a refund can be processed due to the companyâs inability to
disable access. [CLS] [SEP] some publishers utilizing older payment methods are
responsible for handling refunds themselves. [CLS] [SEP] if you are uncertain about refund
eligibility, please [contact support](/support). [CLS] [SEP]

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] unclaimed earnings in publisher accounts

> **summary** if you don't withdraw earnings from your account older than a
> year, we may charge a maintenance fee proportional to any unclaimed money

> to claim your earnings in a timely manner. [CLS] [SEP] if you need itch.io to withhold
> unclaimed payments longer than 12 months [contact support](/support). [CLS] [SEP]

publisher accounts receiving payouts from the company are subject to a
maintenance fee for unclaimed transactions. [CLS] [SEP] payouts from the company are
issued when the company is the merchant of record. [CLS] [SEP]

accrued revenue from transactions initiated over twelve (12) months ago that
has not been claimed for withdrawal may be subject to a maintenance fee. [CLS] [SEP]
company reserves the right to debit your publisher account balance per month:

  * ten percent (10%) of the original revenue earned per purchase older than twelve (12) months

until your balance reaches zero or you initiate a withdrawal for the remainder
of the balance. [CLS] [SEP] publisher accounts may request to delay this fee by
[contacting support](/support) and expressing their intent to claim at a
determined time in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

> in simple english, this means that after 1 year, if you haven't initiated a
> payout for the earnings of a purchase, 10% of it will be debited from your
> account per month. [CLS] [SEP] after 10 months you will no longer be able to claim any
> of that purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

the maintenance charge will not cause your account balance to become negative
and will not cause you to owe money to the company. [CLS] [SEP]

publisher accounts with purchases initiated before the publish date of this
clause (may 24, 2018), have a six month grace period (until november 24, 2018)
where the maintenance fee will not be applied. [CLS] [SEP]
