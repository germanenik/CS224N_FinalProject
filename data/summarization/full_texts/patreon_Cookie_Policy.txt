use on patreon

to summarize: patreon uses cookies and other tracking technologies to provide
our service. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are not strictly necessary for the website to work, but
it will provide you with a better browsing experience. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to delete
or block these cookies, some features of this site may not work as intended. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies are not used to identify you personally and are not used for any
purpose other than those described here. [CLS] [SEP]

security / authentication:

some cookie and similar technology functions are necessary and vital to
ensuring that patreon works properly for visitors and members, such as
maintaining the security, safety, and integrity on patreon, authentication and
logging in (including remembering permissions and consents you have granted),
and ensuring the ability to securely complete transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

performance / analytics and research:

some technologies help provide performance data on how patreon is functioning
in order to make improvements to the platform. [CLS] [SEP] data collected on site and app
functionality and speed, how patreon is used and detecting and gathering
reporting on bugs helps improve patreon and the services we offer. [CLS] [SEP]

preferences / localization:

cookies enable your personalized views and settings. [CLS] [SEP] some cookies help us
provide localized experiences — for example, by making sure you see patreon in
your preferred language. [CLS] [SEP]

social networks / marketing:

some technologies help you to interact with social networks you are signed
into while using patreon, such as logging in with the social network and other
features you employ with the social network, or that are allowed in the social
network’s privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] these may be set and controlled by the social
networks, and your preferences with those social networks. [CLS] [SEP]

“do-not-track” technologies

we do not respond to web browser “do-not-track” signals. [CLS] [SEP]

how to manage cookies

you can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. [CLS] [SEP] if you
reject or delete cookies, our services may no longer function as intended. [CLS] [SEP]
each browser provides different mechanisms for managing cookies. [CLS] [SEP] look at your
browser’s help menu to determine the best way to modify your browser’s cookie
storage. [CLS] [SEP]

changes to cookie policy

we periodically update this cookie policy to account for changed legal and
operational circumstances, to describe new cookies and tracking technologies,
and to describe how those changes affect our use of your information. [CLS] [SEP] if we
are going to use information in a manner that is materially different from
that stated at the time of collection or make any material changes in our
privacy practices, we will notify you. [CLS] [SEP] we will post those changes through a
prominent notice on our website. [CLS] [SEP]

this policy is part of patreon’s [terms of
use](https://patreon.com/policy/legal) and [privacy
