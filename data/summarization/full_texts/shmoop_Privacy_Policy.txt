your use of the shmoop site and services constitutes your consent to this

the shmoop site and shmoop services and our privacy practices or changes in
the law. [CLS] [SEP] please review this policy frequently for any changes. [CLS] [SEP] the most
current version of the privacy policy will govern our use of information about
you and will be located at <https://www.shmoop.com/privacy-policy>. [CLS] [SEP] if shmoop

notice on the site or sending an email to the email address we have on file
for you or that you provided in your shmoop account. [CLS] [SEP] please ensure your email
address remains current so you will receive updates. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions
about this privacy policy, please email us at
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP]

please note that if you are a resident of the european union or california,
you have additional rights as set forth below. [CLS] [SEP]

### information we collect

we collect two types of information from you:

  * information you voluntarily provide when registering or participating in activities or using services on shmoop; and
  * information collected automatically by using cookies and other tracking technologies from your computer or other device that you use to access the site or services, including your geographic location when you use shmoop. [CLS] [SEP]

all personally identifiable information collected from the site or through the
services will not be shared with any other entity without your expressed
consent, other than as described in “exceptions to sharing personally
identifiable information” below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### registration

to use some parts of our site or certain of our services, you must register
with shmoop and create an account (“registration information”). [CLS] [SEP] when you
register, we collect personally identifiable information such as your name and
email address. [CLS] [SEP] you may provide other personally identifiable information
voluntarily (e.g., year in school, gender), but it is not required for
registration. [CLS] [SEP] if you register for a subscription or purchase a product at our
site, then we may collect credit card and debit card information to provide to
our payment processor, including credit/debit card numbers, expiration dates,
cv numbers, billing address, shipping address, date of order, payment
information, and the product or subscription ordered. [CLS] [SEP]  
we use this registration information to contact you about the services on our
site about which you have expressed interest, to process subscriptions, and
provide you the services you have purchased or for which you have registered. [CLS] [SEP]

#### other voluntarily submitted information - user generated content

the services also allow users to submit information and content through the
site and in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP] this includes, but is not limited to
the following:

  * any response, content, or information you provide in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we collect your answers to test prep questions, essays you might write, responses to survey questions or polls, responses to assessment questions in the heartbeat™ tool, and notes and other content you create. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we track your progress and performance in connection with the services you use. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we collect your contact and other information you provide when providing us feedback, making inquiries, or asking for customer support. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * we collect the optional profile information that you wish to share with other users of the site and services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we collect other information that you submit voluntarily through our shmoop message boards, notes, conversations, and other communications. [CLS] [SEP] 

#### automatically collected information

in addition to the information you voluntarily send us while visiting shmoop,
like most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it
in log files. [CLS] [SEP] this information includes, but is not limited to, internet
protocol (ip) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (isp),
referring/exit pages, operating system, mobile device id, advertising
identifiers, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. [CLS] [SEP]

we use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze
trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and to
gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. [CLS] [SEP] we may link
this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. [CLS] [SEP]

shmoop uses third-party products called google analytics, google adsense,
hotjar and rhapsody that use cookies and/or other tracking mechanisms embedded
in our pages to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors
to our site in the aggregate, such as total visitors to the site and length of
visit. [CLS] [SEP] we use this usage information for internal purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we do not share
your personally identifiable information with these third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

### our use of information

we use the information that we collect on our site and through the services
for the following purposes:

  * provide access to the site and to provide you with requested services and customer support and to process and respond to your inquiries; 
  * personalize, customize, measure, and improve our services, content, and advertising and otherwise to enhance your experience of the site; 
  * prevent, detect, and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities or a breach of the shmoop terms of use; 
  * analyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the site and services; 
  * generate and review reports and data about our user base and service usage patterns; 
  * compile aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; 
  * resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems; 
  * enforce our terms of use; 
  * contact you with information, including promotional, marketing, and advertising information and recommendations that we believe may be of interest to you; 
  * provide you with other services requested by you as described when we collect the information; and take any other action as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties without
your expressed consent, other than as described in “exceptions to sharing
personally identifiable information” below. [CLS] [SEP] we may provide information in the
aggregate about our users to third parties for other purposes, but in this
case, all personally identifiable information will be removed. [CLS] [SEP]

### student privacy - ferpa

shmoop may have access to student education records that are subject to the
family educational rights and privacy act (ferpa), 20 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] 1232g, et seq. [CLS] [SEP]
and the regulations promulgated thereunder. [CLS] [SEP] this information is considered
confidential and is, therefore, protected from disclosure, except with the
consent of the student or in the case of a minor, a parent or legal guardian,
or other person authorized to consent on behalf of the student. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that shmoop has access to “education records” subject to ferpa,
it does so as a service provider to educational institutions. [CLS] [SEP] we will only use
such education records and personally identifiable information contained
therein for the purposes of providing services to users that access our
services under our contract with the educational institution. [CLS] [SEP] we will not use
such information to market to the users except to the extent permitted by law
or by our contract with the educational institution. [CLS] [SEP]

except as required or permitted by law, or with consent as noted above, we
shall not disclose or share such education records with any third party unless
(a) such disclosure is permitted by the terms of our contract with the
particular educational institution from which we received the educational
records, and (b) the third party has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of
the education records to the same extent required of shmoop under its contract
with the educational institution. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event any person(s) seek to access protected education records, we will
only retrieve such data or information upon receipt of, and in accordance
with, written directions, if allowed by law. [CLS] [SEP] if we receive a court order or
lawfully issued subpoena seeking the release of such data or information,
shmoop will provide notification to relevant users with a copy of the court
order or lawfully issued subpoena prior to releasing the requested data or
information, if allowed by law or judicial and/or administrative order. [CLS] [SEP]

if a student or his or her parent would like to request to access, modify,
refuse further collection of, or delete a student’s personally identifiable
information that we have been provided under a contract with a school or
school district, please contact your school or school district with your
request as we may not be able to respond to such requests directly under our
contractual confidentiality obligations with the schools and school districts. [CLS] [SEP]

### children's privacy

we are committed to protecting the privacy of persons less than 13 years of
age (“child” or “children”) who use our site or services. [CLS] [SEP] this policy explains
our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with
respect to information provided by children and is in accordance with the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
children’s online privacy protection act (“coppa”). [CLS] [SEP] shmoop does not knowingly
permit any child to register directly for the site or services unless we
reasonably believe, or have received assurances from the subscribing user or
in the case of use under a plan with an educational institution, the
administrator, that the child’s parent has consented to such registration and
use of the site and services. [CLS] [SEP] if shmoop learns that personally identifiable
information of a child has been collected on the site without parental
consent, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. [CLS] [SEP] if
you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has a registered
account with the site without your consent, please email shmoop at
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com) and request that shmoop delete
that child's personally identifiable information from its systems. [CLS] [SEP]

#### registration and use of the site

when a child requests to register for the site or services, shmoop will seek
consent from the child's identified parent or guardian (“parent”). [CLS] [SEP] we may ask
the child to provide certain information for notification and security
purposes, including the parent's email address, the child’s first name and
gender, the child’s username, and password. [CLS] [SEP] we may also ask for birth dates
from children to validate their ages. [CLS] [SEP] please note that children can choose
whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot
function without it. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, children may not be able to access certain
features if required information has not been provided. [CLS] [SEP] we will not require a
child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to
participate in an online activity. [CLS] [SEP] parents may also agree to the collection
and use of their child’s information, but not allow disclosure to third
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

consistent with the requirements of coppa, on any child-targeted site or
application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is
less than 13 years of age, we will ask for a parent email address before we
collect any personally identifiable information from the child. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe
your child is participating in an activity that collects personally
identifiable information and you or another parent have not received an email
providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP] we will not use parent emails
provided for parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless the
parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately
participated in an activity that allows for such email contact. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a parent and wish to provide direct consent for your child’s
registration on the site and services, you must first register through the
site and affirmatively verify you are the child’s parent and consent to the
collection of the child’s personally identifiable information. [CLS] [SEP]

if, in addition to collecting content that includes personally identifiable
information, shmoop also plans to post the content publicly, share it with a
third party for the third party’s own use or allow the child to post content
publicly, we will obtain a higher level of parental consent as required by
coppa (verifiable parental consent). [CLS] [SEP] methods by which we will obtain
verifiable parental consent include, but are not limited to, requiring a
signed consent form by mail, fax or electronic scan, asking for a credit card
or other online payment method for verification, or having the parent speak to
a trained customer service representative by telephone or video chat. [CLS] [SEP] we will
not post a child’s personally identifiable information or content publicly or
except as permitted by law or as stated in the section entitled “when
information collected from children is available to others,” share such
personally identifiable information or content with a third party for their
third party’s own use without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. [CLS] [SEP]

#### teacher or administrator consent

with regard to school-based activities, coppa allows teachers and school
administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the
collection of personally identifiable information from children. [CLS] [SEP] schools
should always notify parents about these activities. [CLS] [SEP]

#### email contact with a child

on occasion, and as permitted by coppa, in order to respond to a question or
request from a child, shmoop may need to ask for the child’s online contact
information, such as an email address. [CLS] [SEP] shmoop will delete this information
immediately after responding to the question or request. [CLS] [SEP]

in connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s
online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate
with the child more than once. [CLS] [SEP] in such instances we will retain the child’s
online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such
as marketing. [CLS] [SEP] whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for
ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address
in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child’s
information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent
further contact with the child. [CLS] [SEP] on some occasions a child may be engaged in
more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to "opt-out"
of each communication individually. [CLS] [SEP]

#### persistent identifiers:

when children interact with us, certain information may automatically be
collected, both to make our site and services more interesting and useful to
children and for various purposes related to our business. [CLS] [SEP] as discussed in
this privacy policy, examples include the type of computer operating system,
the child’s ip address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the
frequency with which the child visits various parts of our site, and
information regarding the online or mobile service provider. [CLS] [SEP] this information
is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons,
and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “cookies; do not
track” section of this privacy policy). [CLS] [SEP] this information may be collected by
shmoop or by third-party businesses for the purposes explained in the
“cookies; do not track” section of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from
children on our site or services for other purposes, if required by coppa, we
will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection. [CLS] [SEP]

#### when information collected from children is available to others

in addition to those instances where a child’s personally identifiable
information is posted publicly (after receiving verifiable parental consent),
we also may share or disclose personally identifiable information collected
from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:

  * we may share information with our service providers if it is necessary for them to perform a technology support function for us, or for other legitimate educational purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may disclose personally identifiable information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our site; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our site, services and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability. [CLS] [SEP] 

#### parental choices and control

at any time, parents can refuse to permit us to use and collect further
personally identifiable information from their children in association with a
particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the
personally identifiable information we have collected in connection with that
account. [CLS] [SEP] please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a
termination of an account, membership, or other service. [CLS] [SEP]

where a child has registered for a shmoop account, we use two methods to allow
parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information
that we have collected from their children:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] parents can request access to and delete their child’s personally identifiable information by logging onto the child’s account. [CLS] [SEP] parents will need their child’s username and password. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] parents can contact us to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personally identifiable information at [support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP]

in any correspondence such as email or mail, please include the child’s
username and the parent’s email address and telephone number. [CLS] [SEP] to protect
children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify
a parent’s identity before granting access to any personally identifiable
information. [CLS] [SEP]

we will retain your child’s information for as long as their account is active
or as needed to provide them services. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to cancel your child’s
account or request that we no longer use that information to provide them
services, please contact us at
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP] we will retain and use their
information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes, and enforce our agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

if we make material changes to how we use personally identifiable information
collected from children, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain
parental consent for the new uses of the child’s personally identifiable
information. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies; do not track

shmoop, along with our third-party service partners, vendors, and business
partners may use cookies, locally stored objects, and web beacons to
automatically collect information about your use of the site. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie is a
small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] we use both “persistent cookies,” which remain on your computer
after you have closed your browser as well as “session cookies,” which exist
only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from your computer when
you close your browser. [CLS] [SEP] locally stored objects or “flash cookies” are data
files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a
way for websites to store information for later use. [CLS] [SEP] locally stored objects
are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your
computer than cookies. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons are small strings of code that provide a
method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for
the purpose of transferring data. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies, locally stored objects, and

### eu data subjects

if you are a resident of the european union, we comply with the general data
protection regulation (“gdpr”) to the extent it is applicable to your
personally identifiable information (for purposes of this section, this term
is the same as “personal data” as defined in the gdpr). [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of the
gdpr, the controller is shmoop university, inc., po box 15550, scottsdale, az
85267. [CLS] [SEP]

we rely on the following legal basis for processing of your personally
identifiable information:

  * consent: we rely on your consent to process personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, such as in the case of processing personally identifiable information for children under 16 or in responding to your requests, or when we ask you to opt-in to certain marketing. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if we rely on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, but such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP] the collection and processing of personally identifiable information based on your consent is in accordance with art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 para. [CLS] [SEP] 1(a) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]
  * necessary to perform a contract: we process personally identifiable information as necessary for the performance of contracts with you, including to provide services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we are not able to provide our services unless you provide us with necessary personally identifiable information, such as the registration information described above. [CLS] [SEP] this collection and processing of personally identifiable information is based on art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 para. [CLS] [SEP] 1(b) gdpr (necessary for the performance of a contract with you). [CLS] [SEP]
  * performance of a legal obligation: we process personally identifiable information as necessary to perform our legal obligations, such as complying with the laws in the jurisdiction in which you reside. [CLS] [SEP] this collection and processing of personally identifiable information is based on art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 para. [CLS] [SEP] 1(c) gdpr (necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject). [CLS] [SEP]
  * legitimate interest: we process personally identifiable information based upon our legitimate interest (except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that require protection of personally identifiable information), such as to improve our site and services, to market our site and services, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to protect our rights, property, and interest, and those of our users, and in the case of business transitions. [CLS] [SEP] such processing is based on art. [CLS] [SEP] 6 para 1(f) gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a data subject of the european union, you have the following
rights:

  * access, correction, and erasure requests: you have the right to: 
    * contact us to confirm whether we are processing your personally identifiable information;
    * receive information on how your personally identifiable information is processed;
    * obtain a copy of your personally identifiable information;
    * request that we update or correct your personally identifiable information; and
    * request that we delete personally identifiable information in certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]
  * right to object to processing: you have the right to request that we cease processing your personally identifiable information for marketing activities, including profiling for statistical purposes where such processing is based upon our legitimate business interests, unless we are able to demonstrate a compelling legitimate basis for such processing or we need to process your personally identifiable information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim. [CLS] [SEP]
  * right to restrict processing: you have the right to request that we limit the processing of your personally identifiable information: 
    * while we are evaluating or in the process of responding to a request by you to update or correct your personally identifiable information where such processing is unlawful and you do not want us to delete your data;
    * where we no longer require such data, but you want us to retain the data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim; and
    * where you have submitted an objection to processing based upon our legitimate business interests, pending our response to such request
  * data portability requests: you have the right to request that we provide you or a third party that you designate with certain of your personally identifiable information in a commonly used, machine readable format. [CLS] [SEP] please note, however, that data portability rights apply only to personally identifiable information that we have obtained directly from you and only where our processing is based upon consent or the performance of a contract. [CLS] [SEP] 

if you believe our processing of your personally identifiable information
violates data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint
with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. [CLS] [SEP] you may do so in
the eu member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the
place of the alleged violation. [CLS] [SEP]

eu data subjects can submit requests by contacting us at support@shmoop.com. [CLS] [SEP]
we will respond to all such requests within 30 days of our receipt of the
request, unless there are extenuating circumstances, in which event we may
take up to 60 days to respond. [CLS] [SEP] we will inform you if we expect our response to
take longer than 30 days. [CLS] [SEP] please note, however, that certain personally
identifiable information may be exempt from such rights pursuant to applicable
data protection laws. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we will not respond to any request unless
we are able to appropriately verify the requester’s identity. [CLS] [SEP] we may charge
you a reasonable fee for subsequent copies of personally identifiable
information that you request. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if we consider that a request is
manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may either request a reasonable fee to
deal with the request or refuse to deal with the request. [CLS] [SEP]

### retention of your information

we retain information for active shmoop accounts as long as it is necessary
and relevant for our operations, which is usually up to 90 days, unless
otherwise specified in an individual agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may retain
information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud,
resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, and
take other actions permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] the information we retain about you will
be handled in accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### your rights under the california consumer privacy act

this california privacy notice supplements the privacy policy and contains the
disclosures required under the california consumer privacy act (“ccpa”). [CLS] [SEP] for
individuals who are california residents, the ccpa requires certain
disclosures about the categories of personally identifiable information (for
purposes of this section this is the same as “personal information” as defined
in the ccpa) we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom
we collect personally identifiable information, and the categories of third
parties with whom we share it. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that for california residents, the term personally identifiable
information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is
reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked,
directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in
the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP] all other capitalized terms have the same meanings as given them in
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a california resident who has provided personally identifiable
information to shmoop university, inc., or a california resident that
reasonably believes that shmoop university, inc., collected or stores their
personally identifiable information, you may exercise your rights under the
ccpa and submit your requests by emailing:
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP]

although we do not sell consumers’ personally identifiable information as
defined under the ccpa, out of an abundance of caution and according to
california law, any california consumer who wants to opt out of the sale of
personally identifiable information may submit a request by contacting us at
[support@shmoop.com](mailto:support@shmoop.com). [CLS] [SEP] if we think the ccpa opt-out
applies, we will process the request in accordance with the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP]

  * disclose if we have collected personally identifiable information about you;

  * disclose the specific pieces of personally identifiable information that we have collected about you (if any); and
  * delete personally identifiable information we have collected about you (if you satisfy the conditions set out in the ccpa). [CLS] [SEP]

in order to submit a request, we will need to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] if you
have an account with us that is password-protected, we may verify your
identity through our existing authentication practices for your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns “categories”
of personally identifiable information collected, we can request from you two
data points of personally identifiable information to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] if
you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns specific
personally identifiable information, we can request from you at least three
data points of personally identifiable information as well as a signed
declaration with penalty of perjury to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that following your verified request, we will send you your
personally identifiable information from the following email address:
support@shmoop.com. [CLS] [SEP] (any response to your request, including any personally
identifiable information may be sent as an encrypted file.)

please note that once you have submitted a request, we will send you a
receipt, acknowledging your request, within 10 business days. [CLS] [SEP] if, for some
reason, you do not receive such a receipt within 10 business days of your
submitted request, please send us an email to support@shmoop.com as an error
may have occurred. [CLS] [SEP]

we will process and respond to your request within 45 calendar days after it
is received (in some cases, as is allowed under the ccpa, this process may be
extended by an additional 45-90 calendar days). [CLS] [SEP]

please note you may only make two requests to know in a 12-month period, and
the information provided need only cover the 12-month period prior to our
receipt of your request. [CLS] [SEP]

as a california resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to
exercise these rights on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we may require proof that you have
designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your
identity directly with us. [CLS] [SEP] please contact us at support@shmoop.com for more
information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent. [CLS] [SEP]

we hereby inform you that if you exercise any of your rights under the ccpa,
we may not deny you goods or services for that reason, or subject you to
different prices than those paid by other consumers, unless provided otherwise
under the ccpa, federal, or state law. [CLS] [SEP]
