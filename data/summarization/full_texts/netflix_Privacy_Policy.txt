  * **information from partners:** we collect information from other companies with whom you have a relationship (“partners”). [CLS] [SEP] these partners might include (depending on what services you use): your tv or internet service provider, or other streaming media device providers who make our service available on their device; mobile phone carriers or other companies who provide services to you and collect payment for the netflix service for distribution to us or provide pre-paid promotions for the netflix service; and voice assistant platform providers who enable interaction with our service through voice commands. [CLS] [SEP] the information partners provide us varies depending on the nature of the partner services, and may include: 

    * search queries and commands applicable to netflix that you make through partner devices or voice assistant platforms; 

    * service activation information such as your email address or other contact information; 

    * ip addresses, device ids or other unique identifiers, as well as associated pre-paid promotion, billing and user interface information, that support user authentication, the netflix service registration experience, partner payment processing, and the presentation of netflix content to you through portions of the partner user interface. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **information from other sources:** we also obtain information from other sources. [CLS] [SEP] we protect this information according to the practices described in this privacy statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.

### use of information

we use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize
our services and marketing efforts, to manage member referrals, to process
your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you
on these and other topics. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use such information to:

  * determine your general geographic location, provide localized content, provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies and tv shows we think will be of interest to you, determine your isp to support network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated isp information for operational and business purposes), and help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests; 

  * coordinate with partners on making the netflix service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the netflix service, based on the specific relationship you have with the partner; 

  * secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of netflix accounts;

  * prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which netflix signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular device is permitted to use the account consistent with our terms of use); 

  * analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery; 

  * communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about netflix, details about new features and content available on netflix, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with operational requests such as password reset requests. [CLS] [SEP] these communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described below). [CLS] [SEP] please see the "your choices" section of this privacy statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences. [CLS] [SEP] 

### disclosure of information

we disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as
described below:

  * **the netflix family of companies:** we share your information among the netflix family of companies ([help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo](https://help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo)) as needed for: providing you with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the use of information section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **service providers:** we use other companies, agents or contractors ("service providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we engage service providers to provide marketing, advertising, communications, security, infrastructure and it services, to customize, personalize and optimize our service, to provide bank account or balance information, to process credit card transactions or other payment methods, to provide customer service, to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. [CLS] [SEP] in the course of providing such services, these service providers may have access to your personal or other information. [CLS] [SEP] we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which includes maintaining and improving their services). [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **partners:** as described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the netflix service to members and providing information about the availability of the netflix service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, depending on what partner services you use, we may share information: 

    * in order to facilitate partner pre-paid promotions or collection of payment for the netflix service for distribution to us; 

    * with partners who operate voice assistant platforms that allow you to interact with our service using voice commands; 

    * so that content and features available in the netflix service can be suggested to you in the partner’s user interface. [CLS] [SEP] for members, these suggestions are part of the netflix service and may include customized and personalized viewing recommendations. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **promotional offers:** we may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. [CLS] [SEP] in fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. [CLS] [SEP] please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **protection of netflix and others:** netflix and its service providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **business transfers:** in connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] 

whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information
to countries outside of the european economic area and other regions with
comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is
transferred in accordance with this privacy statement and as permitted by the
applicable laws on data protection. [CLS] [SEP]

you may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:

  * certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device; 

  * social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information. [CLS] [SEP] 

social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks
themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

### access to account and profiles

  * **“remember me” function:** for ease of access to your account, you can use the "remember me on this device" function when you log in to the website. [CLS] [SEP] this function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account access and to help administer the netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **giving others access to your account:** if you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, and account information (including your email address or other information in the "account" area of our website). [CLS] [SEP] this remains true even if you use our profiles feature. [CLS] [SEP] you might have the option to use seamless account login through the netflix mobile app, which enables login to the netflix app on smart tvs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the wi-fi network to which you are connected. [CLS] [SEP] if you use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **profiles:** profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. [CLS] [SEP] please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your netflix account, so that anyone with access to your netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. [CLS] [SEP] you should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. [CLS] [SEP] profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested (the profile privacy notice applies ([help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy](https://help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy))). [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **removing device access to your netflix account:** to remove access to your netflix account from your devices: (a) visit the "account" section of our website, choose "sign out of all devices," and follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your netflix settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices). [CLS] [SEP] where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. [CLS] [SEP] if you sell or return a computer or netflix ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

### your choices

**email and text messages.** if you no longer want to receive certain
communications from us via email or text message, simply access the
"communications settings" option in the "account" section of our website and
uncheck those items to unsubscribe. [CLS] [SEP] alternatively, click the "unsubscribe"
link in the email or reply stop (or as otherwise instructed) to the text
message. [CLS] [SEP] please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related
correspondence from us, such as messages relating to your account
transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

**push notifications.** you can choose to receive mobile push notifications
from netflix. [CLS] [SEP] on some device operating systems, you will be automatically
enrolled in the notifications. [CLS] [SEP] if you subsequently decide you no longer wish
to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings
functionality to turn them off. [CLS] [SEP] we also offer push notifications on certain
web browsers. [CLS] [SEP] if you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently
decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your
browser’s settings to turn them off. [CLS] [SEP]

**whatsapp.** if you have enabled whatsapp messages in connection with your
netflix account or profile and no longer wish to receive them, you can use
your whatsapp app settings to block them. [CLS] [SEP]

**interest-based ads.** interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to
your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across
the internet. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons can be
used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a
resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help
determine your likely interests. [CLS] [SEP] for your choices about interest-based ads
from netflix, please see the "cookies and internet advertising" section
(below). [CLS] [SEP]

**matched identifier communications.** some third party sites and apps allow
us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by
sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. [CLS] [SEP] a privacy
protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an
email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information
from being revealed. [CLS] [SEP] the third party compares the privacy protective
identifier to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if
you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with netflix and
the third party. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a match, netflix can then choose whether or not
to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or
app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online
advertising. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out in the “marketing communications” section of the
“account” section of our website. [CLS] [SEP]

### your information and rights

you can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-
of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP] you may also
request that we delete personal information that we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP]

when you visit the "account" portion of our website, you have the ability to
access and update a broad range of information about your account, including
your contact information, your netflix payment information, and various
related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed
and rated). [CLS] [SEP] you must be signed in to access the "account" section. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are the account owner, to download a copy of your personal information
go to:
[www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo](https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo)
(you must be signed in to access the "account" section), and follow the
instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

for other requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy
practices, please contact our data protection officer/privacy office at
[privacy@netflix.com](mailto:privacy@netflix.com). [CLS] [SEP] for more information about
how to access your information, including our verification process, please

information about deletion, removal and retention of information, please
reference this help article:
[help.netflix.com/node/100625](https://help.netflix.com/node/100625). [CLS] [SEP] we
respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their
data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. [CLS] [SEP]
please also see the "your choices" section of this privacy statement for
additional choices regarding your information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including
those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate
technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial
fraud. [CLS] [SEP] we may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws
and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records
purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] we
take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a
secure manner when it is no longer required. [CLS] [SEP]

[help.netflix.com/legal/privacy#ccpa](https://help.netflix.com/legal/privacy#ccpa)
or simply scrolling down. [CLS] [SEP]

### security

we use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to
safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized
access, use and modification. [CLS] [SEP] these measures are designed to provide a level
of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

### other websites, platforms and applications

the netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as
voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites
operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information
may differ from ours. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you may be able to access the netflix
service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart tvs, mobile devices,
set top boxes and a number of other internet connected devices. [CLS] [SEP] these websites
and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy
statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. [CLS] [SEP]
in addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the
netflix service. [CLS] [SEP]

### children

you must be at least 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the netflix
service. [CLS] [SEP] minors may only use the service with the involvement, supervision,
and approval of a parent or legal guardian. [CLS] [SEP]

### changes to this privacy statement

we will update this privacy statement from time to time in response to
changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide notice
of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with
law. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the netflix service after any such updates take
effect will constitute acknowledgement and (as applicable) acceptance of those
changes. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to acknowledge or accept any updates to this
privacy statement, you may cancel your use of the netflix service. [CLS] [SEP] to see when
this privacy statement was last updated, please see the "last updated" section
below. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies and internet advertising

we and our service providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web
beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. [CLS] [SEP] we
want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section
explains the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices
regarding their use. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device
identifiers**  
  
cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you
browse and use websites and online services. [CLS] [SEP] we use other technologies such as
browser storage and plugins (e.g., html5, indexeddb, and websql). [CLS] [SEP] like
cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your
device. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in
conjunction with cookies. [CLS] [SEP] in many cases, declining cookies will impair the
effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
if you use the netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media
device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. [CLS] [SEP]
resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are
similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for
example, the "identifier for advertisers" (or idfa) on apple ios devices and
the "google advertising id" on android devices), and certain streaming media
devices. [CLS] [SEP] like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online
advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**why does netflix use these technologies?**

we use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to
access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze,
understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent
fraud; to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our
site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to
understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third
party sites. [CLS] [SEP]

to help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device
identifiers, please see the information below:

  * **essential cookies:** these cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we and our service providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. [CLS] [SEP] they also help us to enforce our terms of use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **performance and functionality cookies:** these cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with netflix. [CLS] [SEP] for example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). [CLS] [SEP] we also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. [CLS] [SEP] deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:** these cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. [CLS] [SEP] these types of ads are called "interest-based advertising." the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our service providers. [CLS] [SEP] 

in connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and
apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we
use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements
(collectively “advertising partners”), may receive limited information from us
as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps
completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information). [CLS] [SEP]

common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and
optimize ad campaigns, by allowing advertising partners to see when someone
who saw an ad later signed up for our service. [CLS] [SEP] another common use is to make
sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the netflix
service if they are already a netflix user. [CLS] [SEP]

netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent
advertising partners from accessing information regarding specific title
selections you make, urls you land on, or shows you have watched on our
service. [CLS] [SEP] we do not share information about title selections or your shows you
have watched on our service. [CLS] [SEP]

**how can i exercise choice regarding these technologies?**

  * **to exercise choice regarding cookies**  
  
for more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other
types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third
parties about your online activities over time and across third-party web
sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to
exercise choices regarding them, click here. [CLS] [SEP] at this time, we do not respond
to web browser "do not track" signals. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **to exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers  
**  
to opt out of interest-based ads from netflix in connection with an resettable
device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices,
please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under
"privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings). [CLS] [SEP] you may still see netflix ads
on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **to exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources  
**  
netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide
additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:

    * in the us: [digital advertising alliance (daa) ](http://www.aboutads.info/)

  * **to exercise choice regarding other technologies**  
  
there are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are
similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., html5,
indexeddb, and websql). [CLS] [SEP] for example, many popular browsers provide the ability
to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see
your browser's help function or support area to learn more. [CLS] [SEP] other
technologies, such as silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the
application. [CLS] [SEP]

### california consumer privacy act (ccpa) privacy notice

this privacy notice applies to california consumers and supplements the
privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

personal information we collect

we collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably
capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (“ccpa personal
information”). [CLS] [SEP] we have collected the following categories of ccpa personal
information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months:

  * **identifiers** : “identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and ip address. [CLS] [SEP] we collect some ccpa personal information that falls into this category. [CLS] [SEP] for example, for streaming subscribers we’re going to have an email address, payment information (like a credit card), and for dvd customers we’re going to have a postal address. [CLS] [SEP] we collect ip addresses, identifiers from the devices you use to connect, and characteristics about the networks you use when you connect to our service online. [CLS] [SEP] these sorts of identifiers are connected to your netflix account. [CLS] [SEP] there are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account, but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **characteristics of protected classifications under california or federal law** : this covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. [CLS] [SEP] we will collect this sort of information about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel. [CLS] [SEP] we do not collect this information when you register for the netflix service. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **commercial information** : this includes information about products or services considered, obtained or purchased. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **internet or other electronic network activity information** : our streaming and dvd services are online services, so we collect ccpa personal information in this category, like your interactions with our service. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **geolocation data** : our streaming and dvd applications don’t collect precise geolocation data from gps sensors. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do collect ip addresses from which we can determine your general location. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information** : we may collect photos, audio and/or video of you in certain circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] for example if you contact customer service, we may record the call (voice recording). [CLS] [SEP]

  * **inferences** : we have a recommendations system that does its best to predict what you’ll be in the mood to watch when you log in. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do not have a list in our recommendation systems that attaches socio-demographic information to you like “soccer dad who likes rom coms” or “financially savvy mom who craves action films” or “singleton high school grad who likes tiny houses.” we have a help article that explains how our recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver is what you actually choose to watch through our service. [CLS] [SEP] you can read the article at [www.netflix.com/recommendations](http://www.netflix.com/recommendations). [CLS] [SEP]

uses of ccpa personal information

we use categories of ccpa personal information listed above for the purposes
noted in the use of information section of our privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] for ease of
reference, we repeat that section below:

we use personal information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and
personalize our services and marketing efforts, to process your registration,
your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other
