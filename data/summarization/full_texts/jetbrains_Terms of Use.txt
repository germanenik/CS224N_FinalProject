## **cookies and other tracking technologies**

we, and our third-party service providers, use cookies and other tracking
technologies ("cookies") on our website and within our products or services
(collectively our "site"). [CLS] [SEP] see below for more information about these
technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

we use cookies to identify you when you visit our site, to deliver our
products and services to you, to provide you with services when you browse our
site, and to improve our site and the services that we provide ("service
purposes"). [CLS] [SEP] with your consent, we may also use cookies for analytics purposes
and for targeted advertising ("commercial purposes"). [CLS] [SEP] any personal data
collected by these technologies will be stored and processed for no longer
than 1 year. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **your consent / withdrawing consent**

you acknowledge that the site will use cookies as explained above for the
service purposes. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide us with your consent to use cookies also for
commercial purposes, then you can withdraw your consent at any time by
visiting [www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/](https://www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/). [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not wish cookies to be stored on your device in connection with your
use of this site, you must stop using the site and disable cookies via your
browser settings for the site or globally (see below). [CLS] [SEP] please note that
disabling cookies will affect the functionality of our site and may prevent
you from being able to access certain features of our site, products, or
services. [CLS] [SEP] for further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please
visit: [http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-
cookies/](http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

#### **more about the technologies we use**

_cookies._ a cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on
your browser or on the hard drive of your computer. [CLS] [SEP] unless you have adjusted
your browser’s settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue
cookies as soon as you visit our site. [CLS] [SEP] there are two types of cookies:

_persistent cookies:_ these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period
of time specified in the cookie. [CLS] [SEP] they are activated each time the user visits
the website that created that particular cookie. [CLS] [SEP]

_session cookies:_ these cookies allow website operators to link the actions
of a user during a browser session. [CLS] [SEP] a browser session starts when a user opens
the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. [CLS] [SEP] session
cookies are created temporarily. [CLS] [SEP] once you close the browser, all session
cookies are deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies can be either first-party or third-party cookies. [CLS] [SEP] whether a cookie is
first-party or third-party depends on which domain placed the cookie. [CLS] [SEP]

_first-party cookies_ are those placed by a website being visited by the user
at the time (for example, cookies placed by us). [CLS] [SEP] cookies placed by jetbrains
are used when you create an account, identify yourself using a jetbrains
account, purchase products using our e-store, or use any of our services,
including (but not limited to) our issue tracker, blogs and discussions
forums, signing up for our newsletter, and so on. [CLS] [SEP] at times we may also use
cookies for testing out new features of our website and/or web-based services
with a subset of our audience. [CLS] [SEP]

_third-party cookies_ are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of
the website being visited by the user. [CLS] [SEP] if a user visits a website and another
entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie. [CLS] [SEP]

_clear gifs, pixel tags, and other similar technologies._ clear gifs are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. [CLS] [SEP] in contrast
to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are
embedded invisibly on web pages. [CLS] [SEP] we may use clear gifs (a.k.a. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons,
web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with our website to, among other
things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and
compile statistics about website usage. [CLS] [SEP] we and our third-party service
providers also use clear gifs in html emails to our customers, to help us
track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track
whether our emails are forwarded. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **how to delete and block our cookies**

you can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows
you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you use your
browser settings to block all cookies (including cookies that are essential
for the site to work), you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **what cookies do we use and why?**

generally, our site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our
site. [CLS] [SEP] the cookies used on our site, regardless of whether they are used for
service purposes or commercial purposes, are categorized as follows:

a) strictly necessary

b) performance

c) functionality

d) targeting

_'strictly necessary'_ – these cookies let you move around the site and use
essential features like secure areas. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, we cannot provide
the requested services. [CLS] [SEP] we use strictly necessary cookies to:

a) identify you as being logged in to our site and to authenticate you. [CLS] [SEP]

b) make sure you connect to the right service on our site when we make any
changes to the way the site works. [CLS] [SEP]

c) for security purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

accepting these cookies is a condition of using the site, so if you block
these cookies, the site may not work correctly and we may not be able to
provide our services and products to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_'performance'_ – these cookies collect information about how you use our
site, for example, which pages you visit, and if you experience any errors. [CLS] [SEP]
performance cookies do not collect any information that could identify you,
and are only used to help us improve how our site works, understand what
interests our users, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising. [CLS] [SEP] we use
performance cookies to:

a) carry out web analytics – provide statistics on how our site is used. [CLS] [SEP]

b) obtain data on the number of site users that have viewed a product. [CLS] [SEP]

c) help us improve the site by registering any errors that occur. [CLS] [SEP]

d) test different designs for the site. [CLS] [SEP]

some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
allow such third parties to use these cookies for any purposes other than
those listed above. [CLS] [SEP]

_'functionality' cookies_ – these are used to provide products or services or
to remember settings to improve your visit. [CLS] [SEP] we use functionality cookies for
such purposes as:

a) remembering settings you've applied, such as layout, text size, language,
preferences, and colors. [CLS] [SEP]

b) remembering if we've already asked you whether you want to fill in a
survey. [CLS] [SEP]

c) remembering if you have engaged with a particular component or product list
on the site so that it isn’t shown again unnecessarily. [CLS] [SEP]

d) showing you when you're logged in to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

e) providing and showing embedded video content. [CLS] [SEP]

some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow
such third parties to use these cookies for any purposes other than those
listed above. [CLS] [SEP]

_'targeting' cookies_ – targeting cookies are used to track your visit to our
site and other websites, including the pages you have visited and the links
you have followed, which allows third parties to display targeted ads to you
on the websites you visit. [CLS] [SEP]

we and our third-party service providers use targeting cookies to:

a) link to social networks, like facebook, that may subsequently use
information about your visit to our website in order to provide advertising or
other offers that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites. [CLS] [SEP]

b) provide third parties with information on your visit so that they can
present you with advertisements or other offers that may be of interest to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are in the eu, you may opt-out of certain third-party cookies that we
and other websites may use for targeting, via
[http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or
[www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). [CLS] [SEP] opting out of one or more ad
networks only means that members of those particular ad networks will no
longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. [CLS] [SEP] it does not mean you will no
longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other third-
party websites. [CLS] [SEP] if your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit
one of the aforementioned opt-out pages, and you later erase your cookies, use
a different computer, or change web browsers, your preference may no longer be
active. [CLS] [SEP] since all of these cookies are managed by third parties, you should
refer to the third parties' own website privacy notifications and policies for
further information (see below for more information about the particular
targeting cookies used on our site). [CLS] [SEP]

users in the united states may opt out of many third-party ad networks. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, you may go to the digital advertising alliance ("daa") [consumer
choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information on opting out
of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding having your
information used by [daa companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/). [CLS] [SEP]
you may also go to the network advertising initiative ("nai") [consumer opt-
out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information on
opting out of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding
having your information used by [nai
members](http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks). [CLS] [SEP]

opting out of one or more of the companies listed on the daa [consumer choice
page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the nai [consumer opt-out
page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) will opt you out from those
companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not
mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our site or on other
websites. [CLS] [SEP] you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on
the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., context-based ads). [CLS] [SEP] also,
note that if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out
on the daa or nai websites, your opt-out may not be effective. [CLS] [SEP] additional
information is available on the daa's website at
[www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and on the nai's website at
[www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). [CLS] [SEP]

#### **do not track**

currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. [CLS] [SEP] you
may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies in your browser. [CLS] [SEP]
however, by doing so we cannot guarantee the correct behavior of the services
we provide to you. [CLS] [SEP]
