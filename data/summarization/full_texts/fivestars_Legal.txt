any and all activities that occur under your account. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to (a)
immediately notify fivestars of any unauthorized use of your account or any
other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out of your account at
the end of each session. [CLS] [SEP] fivestars will not be liable for any loss or damage

to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

 **rewards** : by using the service, you may have the opportunity to qualify
for rewards through promotional campaigns offered by merchants that
participate in the service. [CLS] [SEP] all rewards made available in connection with the
service are promotional only and have no cash value. [CLS] [SEP] you have no property
value in any rewards. [CLS] [SEP] such rewards are made available directly by the relevant
merchant providing such reward (“rewards provider”), and not fivestars, and
are redeemable solely for the applicable goods or services of the relevant
rewards provider as may be determined by such rewards provider. [CLS] [SEP] the rewards
provider, not fivestars, is the provider of the rewards and such goods and
services and is solely responsible for redeeming any rewards you obtain. [CLS] [SEP]
fivestars will have no liability if a rewards provider refuses or fails to
honor any reward. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, the following terms and conditions also apply
to all rewards:

  * rewards may not be cashed out or transferred into any other medium of exchange. [CLS] [SEP]
  * rewards are nontransferable. [CLS] [SEP]

  * use of rewards relating to alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the rewards provider and is subject to compliance with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * rewards cannot be combined with any other rewards, offers, vouchers, third-party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by the rewards provider. [CLS] [SEP]
  * neither fivestars nor the rewards provider is responsible for malfunctioning, lost, or stolen cards. [CLS] [SEP]
  * reproduction or sale of any reward is prohibited. [CLS] [SEP]
  * any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms or any other restrictions imposed by the rewards provider or fivestars (including any reward-specific terms associated with a reward) will render the reward void. [CLS] [SEP]
  * rewards are void to the extent prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * rewards may be applied only to the applicable products or services sold by the rewards provider that are the subject of such rewards as determined by such rewards provider. [CLS] [SEP]

a rewards provider may discontinue its rewards program and participation with
fivestars’ service at any time. [CLS] [SEP] fivestars also reserves the right to terminate
a rewards provider’s rewards program and participation with the service at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] upon termination of a rewards program for whatever reason, all rewards
will become null and void and will not be redeemable for any good, service, or
any other value, financial or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

 **third-party services** : you may register for the service using third-party
services (e.g., facebook login) and otherwise enable various third-party
services to be directly integrated into your fivestars experience. [CLS] [SEP] by enabling
third-party services within the service, you are allowing us to pass your log-
in information or other information (e.g., token authentication information)
to these services for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] please remember that the manner in which
third-party services use, store and disclose your information is governed
solely by the policies of such third parties, and fivestars shall have no
liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any

such features does not imply an endorsement or recommendation. [CLS] [SEP]

 **mobile services** : the service includes certain services that are
available via a mobile device, including the ability to upload content to the
service and the ability to browse and otherwise access the service or certain
features thereof (“mobile services”). [CLS] [SEP] to the extent you access the service

 **third party applications**

the service may be available or accessed in connection with fivestars
applications (“applications”) made available through third party providers
such as apple, inc., or google, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“provider”) through their storefronts
such as the app store and google play. [CLS] [SEP]

  * fivestars and you acknowledge that these terms are between fivestars and you only, and not with any provider, and that as between fivestars and any provider, fivestars, not the provider, is solely responsible for the applications and the content thereof. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may not use the applications in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the usage rules set forth for applications made available through a provider, or otherwise be in conflict with the terms of use of the provider. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your license to use applications is limited to a non-transferable license to use the applications on a device that you own or control, as permitted by the usage rules set forth in the terms of use of the provider. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the applications. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provider is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of any failure of the application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify provider, and provider will refund the purchase price for the application to you, if any; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the applications, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be fivestars’ sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * fivestars and you acknowledge that fivestars, not provider, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the applications or your possession and/or use of those applications, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the applications fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in the event of any third party claim that the applications or the end-user’s possession and use of those applications infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between fivestars and provider, fivestars, not provider, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government embargo, or that has been designated by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the office of foreign assets control’s specially designated nationals list; and (iii) you will comply with u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export control laws in connection with your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the applications, they should be directed to fivestars as follows:  
[support@fivestars.com](mailto:support@fivestars.com)  
five stars loyalty, inc. [CLS] [SEP]  
500 3rd st #405,

860-578-2770

fivestars and you acknowledge and agree that provider, and provider’s
subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these terms with respect to the
applications made available through provider, and that, upon your acceptance
of the terms and conditions of these terms, provider will have the right (and
will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you
with respect to the applications as a third party beneficiary thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

 **third party websites**

the service may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access
to other sites and resources on the internet (including rewards provider
websites). [CLS] [SEP] fivestars has no control over such sites and resources, and
fivestars is not responsible for and does not endorse such sites and
resources. [CLS] [SEP] you further acknowledge and agree that fivestars shall not be
responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused
or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any
content, events, goods or services available on or through any such site or
resource. [CLS] [SEP] any dealings you have with third parties (including rewards
providers) while using the service are between you and the third party, and
you agree that fivestars is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have
against any such third party. [CLS] [SEP]  
indemnity and release

you agree to release, indemnify and hold fivestars and its affiliates and
their officers, employees, directors and agents harmless from and against any
and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out
of or relating to your use of the service, any user content, your connection
to the service, your violation of these terms of service or your violation of
any rights of another. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a california resident, you waive california
civil code section 1542, which says: “a general release does not extend to
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
affected his settlement with the debtor.” if you are a resident of another
jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine. [CLS] [SEP]

 **disclaimer of warranties**

your use of the service is at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP] the service is provided on an
“as is” and “as available” basis. [CLS] [SEP] fivestars expressly disclaims all warranties
of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited
to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]  
fivestars makes no warranty that (i) the service will meet your requirements,
(ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, (iii)
the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate
or reliable, or (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or
other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your
expectations. [CLS] [SEP]

 **limitation of liability**

you expressly understand and agree that fivestars, its affiliates, officers,
employees, directors, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect,
incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or damages for loss
of profits, including but not limited to, damages for loss of goodwill, use,
data or other intangible losses (even if fivestars has been advised of the
possibility of such damages), whether based on contract, tort, negligence,
strict liability or otherwise, resulting from (i) the use or the inability to
use the service; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services
resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained,
messages received, or transactions entered into through or from the service;
(iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv)
statements or conduct of any third party on the service; or (v) any other
matter relating to the service. [CLS] [SEP] in no event shall fivestars’ total liability
to you for all damages, losses or causes of action exceed the amount you have
paid fivestars in the last six (6) months or one hundred dollars ($100),
whichever is less. [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
dissatisfied with any portion of the service or with these terms of service,
your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]  
arbitration and class waiver

any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the service, other
than a court action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual
property rights, (“covered disputes”) will be resolved by binding arbitration,
rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court
if your claims qualify. [CLS] [SEP] the federal arbitration act and federal arbitration
law apply to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
award is limited. [CLS] [SEP] however, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory
relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these terms as a
court would. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration will be conducted by jams under its rules, including the jams
consumer minimum standards. [CLS] [SEP] jams’s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or
by calling 1-800-352-5267. [CLS] [SEP] payment of all filing, administration and
arbitrator fees will be governed by the jams rules. [CLS] [SEP] we will reimburse those
fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines
the claims are frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs
in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] you
may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually
agreed location. [CLS] [SEP]  
we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only
on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
action. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
we each waive any right to a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP]

this arbitration and class waiver agreement not only applies to covered
disputes between you and fivestars, but also to covered disputes between you
and reward providers, other merchants who participate in fivestars loyalty
programs, or vendors who perform services for fivestars. [CLS] [SEP]

 **choice of law**

except as provided above in the arbitration and class waiver section, these
terms will be governed by the laws of california without regard to choice of
law principles. [CLS] [SEP] this choice of law provision is only intended to specify the
use of california law to interpret this agreement and does not create any
other substantive right to non-californians to assert claims under california
law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]  
termination

you agree that fivestars, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate
your account (or any part thereof) or use of the service for any reason,
including, without limitation, for lack of use or if fivestars believes that
you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity may be grounds
for termination of your use of the service and may be referred to appropriate
law enforcement authorities. [CLS] [SEP] fivestars may also in its sole discretion and at
any time discontinue providing the service, or any part thereof, with or
without notice. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any termination of your access to the service
under any provision of these terms may be effected without prior notice, and
acknowledge and agree that fivestars may immediately deactivate or delete your
account and all of your related rewards. [CLS] [SEP] further, you agree that fivestars
shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your
access to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

 **user disputes**

you agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other
user, rewards provider or third party in connection with the service (or any
third-party service with which the service is integrated), and fivestars will
have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. [CLS] [SEP] fivestars reserves
the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes
