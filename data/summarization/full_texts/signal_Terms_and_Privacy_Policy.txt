## privacy policy

signal utilizes state-of-the-art security and end-to-end encryption to provide

encrypted](https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta/). [CLS] [SEP]

 **messages.** signal cannot decrypt or otherwise access the content of your
messages or calls. [CLS] [SEP] signal queues end-to-end encrypted messages on its servers
for delivery to devices that are temporarily offline (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] a phone whose

book are signal users, using a service designed to protect the privacy of your

which of your contacts are registered](https://signal.org/blog/contact-
discovery/). [CLS] [SEP]

may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and
contacting you about your case. [CLS] [SEP]

 **managing your information.** you can manage your personal information in
signal’s application settings. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can update your profile
information or choose to enable additional privacy features like a
registration lock pin. [CLS] [SEP]

### information we may share

 **third parties.** we work with third parties to provide some of our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our third-party providers send a verification code to
your phone number when you register for our services. [CLS] [SEP] these providers are
bound by their privacy policies to safeguard that information. [CLS] [SEP] if you use
other third-party services like youtube, spotify, giphy, etc. [CLS] [SEP] in connection
with our services, their terms and privacy policies govern your use of those
services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **other instances where signal may need to share your data**
