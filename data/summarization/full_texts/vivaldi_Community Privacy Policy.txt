# community - privacy policy

## general

at vivaldi technologies as (“vivaldi”), protecting your privacy is one of our
top priorities. [CLS] [SEP] we strictly protect the security of your personal information
within vivaldi’s community services (mail, blogs, forum and sync). [CLS] [SEP]

we do not share or sell your personal data with any third party. [CLS] [SEP] we protect
user data from disclosure, with exceptions only requested by law or court
order. [CLS] [SEP]

the purpose of this policy is to inform you of how vivaldi will process your
personal data as data controllers and the measures and processes we have put
in place to ensure its adequate protection. [CLS] [SEP] providing this kind of information
is also one of the requirements under the general data protection regulation
2016/679 (“gdpr”). [CLS] [SEP]



## types of data we process and for what purposes

when you visit vivaldi’s websites, we collect some visitor statistics. [CLS] [SEP] the
visitor statistics include information about the visitor’s truncated ip-
address, usage patterns, the point in time the visitor visits our websites on
[vivaldi.net](https://vivaldi.net) and [vivaldi.com](https://vivaldi.com/) and
information about the browser and operating system the visitor uses. [CLS] [SEP]

this information is collected solely for statistical purpose and is not used
to identify individuals. [CLS] [SEP] we use these statistics to improve and optimize
usability of our products and services for our users. [CLS] [SEP] these statistics help us
determine where we need to improve and prioritize our resources. [CLS] [SEP] the legal
basis for the processing is the legitimate interest vivaldi has in providing
you with a good experience when visiting the websites. [CLS] [SEP]

vivaldi’s websites use cookies. [CLS] [SEP] a cookie is a tiny data file that resides on
your computer, mobile phone or another device, and allows us to recognize you
as a visitor when you return to the website using the same computer and web
browser. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to provide more customized experience to our visitors. [CLS] [SEP]
the legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest vivaldi has in
providing you with a good experience when visiting the websites. [CLS] [SEP] you can
remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser. [CLS] [SEP]

we keep the contact information you provide in your account profile. [CLS] [SEP] we use
this contact information in case of lost passwords, username recovery, account
confirmation, or other account-related support work. [CLS] [SEP] we also use this contact
information to keep you updated about any technical development in our browser
and services and, if you have decided so, send you our newsletter. [CLS] [SEP]

you can unsubscribe from any of our communications at any time by clicking on
“unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email or visit
[https://vivaldi.com/newsletter/unsubscribe](https://vivaldi.com/newsletter/unsubscribe/). [CLS] [SEP]
the legal basis for the processing is the fulfillment of your request
(contract) and the legitimate interest vivaldi has in providing you with
updates and newsletters pertaining the services. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to provide our forum service and identify possible account abuse, we
collect your email address, hashed ip address, profile picture, posts and
topics, and the history of changes. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have access to your private
chats. [CLS] [SEP] vivaldi forum uses a modified version of the akismet plugin to mitigate
spam. [CLS] [SEP] the plugin has been modified so that the only information sent back to
akismet is username and comment content, excluding personal data like ip and
email address as the default install would require. [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis for the
processing is the legitimate interest vivaldi has in providing you with a good
experience when using our forum service. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to provide you our mail service we process the following email
metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the ip address from which
incoming messages originated, and message sent and received times. [CLS] [SEP] email
messages are scanned by automated systems that allow us to detect malicious
activity. [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis for the processing is the fulfilment of your request
(contract) and the legitimate interest vivaldi has in providing you with a
good experience when using our email service. [CLS] [SEP]

to protect our webmail and blog services from fraudulent users, we will in
addition ask for your phone number as phone number verification provides an
added level of security. [CLS] [SEP] we use the third-party service nexmo to send you sms
and won't use the phone number for anything else but account verification. [CLS] [SEP]
read more about their [privacy policy](https://www.nexmo.com/privacy-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

if you use vivaldi sync feature, the documentation about the data we collect
and for what purposes for this service is available [here](/privacy/sync/). [CLS] [SEP]
the legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest vivaldi has in
providing you with a good experience when using our sync feature. [CLS] [SEP]

## access

vivaldi has strict restrictions on access to user data. [CLS] [SEP] only a limited number
of vivaldi’s employees or employees at vivaldi’s service providers for the web
hosting services have access to such data. [CLS] [SEP]

through vivaldi community services, you can directly access, edit, delete or
export your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

## transfer

vivaldi will not transfer any personal data to third parties except as
required by law or law enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

## retention and deletion

vivaldi will delete personal information when all purposes of the personal
information processing have been fulfilled and when deletion is allowed
pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

when you close your vivaldi account, your data is immediately deleted from our
production servers except for emails which might be retained for up to seven
days. [CLS] [SEP]

email logs are stored for up to three months. [CLS] [SEP]

accidental or unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or
access. [CLS] [SEP]

any non-conformance regarding the policies will be corrected without
unnecessary delay. [CLS] [SEP]

## complaints

regulator if you consider that we have breached your data protection rights. [CLS] [SEP]

privacy statement, we will include the date when the privacy statement was
last updated. [CLS] [SEP] if there are material changes to this statement or in how we use

notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending
