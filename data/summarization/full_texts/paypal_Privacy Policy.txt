### overview

this privacy statement explains how and why paypal collects, stores, uses, and
shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. [CLS] [SEP] reading
it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. [CLS] [SEP]

“personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your
identity, finances, and online behavior. [CLS] [SEP]

“paypal” in this statement means paypal, inc. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy statement only
applies to the paypal and xoom services offered by paypal. [CLS] [SEP] to learn about our
privacy practices for our other products or services, like venmo or braintree,
visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or
service. [CLS] [SEP]

### your privacy rights and choices

when it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and
shared, you have rights and choices. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **understanding your rights**

you have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected
about you in the past 12 months. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the right to ask us to delete
your personal data we have collected about you. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to see or delete
your personal data, contact us. [CLS] [SEP] we will not deny you services, charge you
different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for
exercising your privacy rights. [CLS] [SEP]

if you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify
who you are before we can respond to your request. [CLS] [SEP] if we can’t verify your
identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. [CLS] [SEP]

if you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:

  * log in to your account and delete information you previously added. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings
  * call us and request that we delete specific information
  * close your account

if you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still
need to keep some personal data so we can:

  * complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us
  * detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
  * protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
  * manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services
  * comply with laws

depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have
different rights and choices for managing your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
certain state privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed,
or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the
gramm-leach-bliley act. [CLS] [SEP] consumers may read our _consumer privacy notice_ for
more information about their rights under us federal law. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **understanding your choices**

you can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we
communicate with you. [CLS] [SEP] here are some of the ways you can customize your
choices. [CLS] [SEP]

**choose how we collect personal data**

you may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or
services request it. [CLS] [SEP] to help make choices that are right for you, it’s
important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more
personalized experience for you. [CLS] [SEP] also, some personal data is required for our
services to function at all. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the
people you want to send money to. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose not to share your contacts
with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as
fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. [CLS] [SEP] another example is
creating an account with us. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose not to provide information that is
required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will
not be able to create an account for you. [CLS] [SEP]

**choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data**

if you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to
manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. [CLS] [SEP] read the
third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you. [CLS] [SEP]

you can control which third-party services you connect to your account and
what personal data they can collect about you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, to manage the
permissions, go to the security settings in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

**choose how we communicate with you**

your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose
of the message and how it is delivered. [CLS] [SEP] some messages are considered optional
and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. [CLS] [SEP] we use email,
text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail
depending on the situation and your preferences. [CLS] [SEP]

you can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text
message by replying “stop,” or turn off notifications on your device. [CLS] [SEP] you can
also change your account’s notification settings or the notification
preferences on your device. [CLS] [SEP]

you won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you
to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes
in your account’s status that require your attention. [CLS] [SEP] you may be able to
decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a
notification on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]

### the personal data we collect

we may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services,
such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a
merchant’s website. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll
still collect personal data, which may include your payment information,
device information, and location. [CLS] [SEP] when you use our services without creating
or logging into an account, we will use this information to process
transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. [CLS] [SEP] we may connect this
information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at
a later date. [CLS] [SEP]

here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an
account or use our services:

1\. [CLS] [SEP] information that identifies you, for example:

  * first and last name
  * address
  * phone number
  * email
  * ip address
  * information collected from cookies or other tracking technologies

2\. [CLS] [SEP] records and financial information, for example:

  * social security number
  * government-issued identification
  * bank account and routing numbers
  * credit and debit card information
  * financial information

3\. [CLS] [SEP] personal characteristics, for example:

  * age
  * national origin
  * disability
  * citizenship
  * military status

4\. [CLS] [SEP] commercial information, for example:

  * online shopping cart information
  * purchase history

5\. [CLS] [SEP] internet or network activity, for example:

  * interactions with our services or sites
  * shopping history

6\. [CLS] [SEP] geolocation data, for example:

  * global positioning system (gps) information when you give us permission through your device settings
  * ip-based geolocation

7\. [CLS] [SEP] audio, electronic, visual, biometric, or similar information, for example:

  * call recordings when you talk to customer service
  * voice identification, when you consent to this biometric method of authentication
  * photo ids and profile pictures you provide

8\. [CLS] [SEP] professional or employment information, for example:

  * business information, contact emails and phone numbers
  * tax ids

9\. [CLS] [SEP] information we infer based on your personal data, for example:

  * fraud and risk assessments
  * personalization preferences

### where personal data comes from

we may collect personal information about you from various sources, for
example from:

  * you
  * merchants
  * our payment partners, such as card networks and payment processors
  * financial institutions, such as banks
  * credit bureaus
  * service providers, such as companies that help us manage risk and fraud, deliver services to you, and market our services

we do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not
allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP]
_contact us_ if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from
someone not allowed to use our services. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll delete it immediately, unless
we’re legally required to keep it. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **how we use tracking technologies like cookies**

we or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking
technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our
sites, or visit websites that offer our services. [CLS] [SEP] the information collected
with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the
effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and
service. [CLS] [SEP]

you can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. [CLS] [SEP] but, since
some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become
difficult or impossible to use. [CLS] [SEP]

some web browsers have an optional setting called “do not track” (dnt) that
lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. [CLS] [SEP]
because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not
respond to dnt settings. [CLS] [SEP]

if you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our [_cookie
statement_](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full). [CLS] [SEP] to learn
how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit [_about
ads_](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=en). [CLS] [SEP]

### why we collect personal data

we collect personal data for many reasons, including to improve your
experience, and to run our business. [CLS] [SEP] specific reasons why we collect your
personal data include:

[CLS] [SEP] in this case, we might use tracking technologies like cookies. [CLS] [SEP] see our [cookie statement](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full) for more details. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] send you locally relevant options, but only if you agree to let us track your location. [CLS] [SEP] if you do, this can help us enhance the security of our sites and services, and customize our services by using the right language and personalizing content such as ads and search results. [CLS] [SEP]
  7. [CLS] [SEP] make it easy for you to find and connect with others. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, if you let us access your contacts, we can suggest connections with people you may know. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] comply with laws and enforce our agreements with you and other people who use our services. [CLS] [SEP]
