# terms of service

doxy.me terms of service

last revised march 2020

what words our lawyers use:

these terms of service (“terms of use”) apply to healthcare and content
providers and govern their use of the online interfaces and properties (e.g.,
websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by doxy.me, llc
(“doxy.me”), including the[ https://doxy.me](https://doxy.me/) website (the
“site”) and the services available to users through the site (“services”). [CLS] [SEP]
"providers" "you" "your" and similar terms refer to healthcare and content
providers who access or use the site and/or services. [CLS] [SEP] your compliance with
these terms of use is a condition to your use of the site and/or services. [CLS] [SEP]

please read these terms of use carefully. [CLS] [SEP] by clicking “accept” or accessing
the site and/or using the services, you agree to be bound by these terms of
use. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to be bound by these terms of use, you may not access
or use the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] by accepting these terms or by accessing the site
or using the services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and
agree to be bound by the terms of use including the privacy policy referenced
below. [CLS] [SEP] if you are not eligible or do not agree to the terms of use, then you
do not have permission to access the site or use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

please also review the doxy.me [privacy policy](https://doxy.me/privacy-
policy). [CLS] [SEP] it contains a description of our privacy practices and policies,
including how we collect and handle your information. [CLS] [SEP] it is incorporated in
and is a part of these terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] if you use the site or services, you are
also accepting the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

what this means in plain english: (however, the words our lawyers use are
controlling and binding):

these are the rules to use this site, our terms of service or terms of use
(call it what you want). [CLS] [SEP] also, be sure to read our privacy policy to
understand the details of how we use the data we may collect about you. [CLS] [SEP] if you
don't like or agree to these terms of use and or our privacy policy, do not
use our site or services. [CLS] [SEP]

1\. [CLS] [SEP] ownership of the site

all pages within this site and any material made available by doxy.me for
download are the property of doxy.me, or its licensors or suppliers, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP] the site is protected by the united states and international
copyright and trademark laws. [CLS] [SEP] the contents of the site, including without
limitation the files, documents, text, photographs, images, audio, and video,
and any materials accessed through or made available for use or download
through the site (“content”) may not be copied, distributed, modified,
reproduced, published or used, in whole or in part, except for purposes
authorized or approved in writing by doxy.me. [CLS] [SEP] you may not frame or utilize
framing techniques to enclose, or deep linking to, any name, trademarks,
service marks, logo, content or other proprietary information (including;
images, text, page layout, or form) of doxy.me without our express written
consent. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, materials you post in your virtual
waiting room are yours alone and you are solely responsible for that content. [CLS] [SEP]
see section 4, below for more about your virtual waiting room. [CLS] [SEP]

we own this website and its content; do not steal it. [CLS] [SEP] the content you post on
your virtual waiting room is yours alone. [CLS] [SEP]

2\. [CLS] [SEP] providers

to be a healthcare provider using the site (“provider”) you must agree to
comply with all laws, medical or other board rules, or other rules and
regulations applicable to you as a healthcare provider or other professional
using the site. [CLS] [SEP] your relationship with the doxy.me users (including your
patients/clients) is directly between you and the patient. [CLS] [SEP] the patient will
never have a physician-patient relationship with doxy.me. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not
practice medicine or any other licensed profession and offers no medical or
other professional services. [CLS] [SEP] as set forth more fully in section 10, provider
is solely responsible for all agreements, consents, notices and other
interactions with patients and other consumers. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, provider is solely responsible for all billings
and collections from patients and other consumers, and doxy.me shall have no
liability whatsoever to provider concerning any amounts owed by any patient or
other consumers to provider. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use our site to provide services to others we call you a "provider". [CLS] [SEP]
you agree to do so in a legal way and follow all rules and regulations you are
governed by. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me does not provide services to your patients, clients, or
anyone other than you the provider. [CLS] [SEP]

3\. [CLS] [SEP] independent professional judgment and indemnification

the provider will use the site and services only in accordance with applicable
standards of good professional practice. [CLS] [SEP] while software products such as the
site and services can facilitate and improve the quality of service that
provider and its personnel offer to patients, many factors, including the
provider/patient relationship can affect a patient outcome, and with intricate
and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making it is often
difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in
what proportion they affected an outcome. [CLS] [SEP] provider shall be solely responsible
for its use of the site and services, and the provision of services to
provider’s patients. [CLS] [SEP] in this regard, provider releases doxy.me and waives all
potential claims against doxy.me as a result of the provider’s use of the site
and services, and the provision of services to provider’s patients. [CLS] [SEP] as a
result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the patient care
process, and if applicable and allowed by law, provider agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold doxy.me harmless from any claim by or on behalf of any
patient of provider or its personnel, or by or on behalf of any other third
party or person claiming damage by virtue of a familial or financial
relationship with such a patient, which is brought against doxy.me, regardless
of the cause if such claim arises for any reason whatsoever, out of the use or
operation of the site and services. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent applicable, provider will
obtain doxy.me’s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which
provider agrees to or which otherwise provides or implies any finding of fault
of doxy.me or any defect in the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me will promptly notify
provider in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly
provide provider with the information reasonably required for the defense of
the same, and grant to provider exclusive control over its defense at
providers expense. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me reserves the right to appear and defend any actions
in which it is named as a party. [CLS] [SEP] provider agrees to pay and reimburse
doxy.me's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred
in connection with such a suit. [CLS] [SEP]

if you, your patients or any third party seeking to recover any sums from
doxy.me arising from your use of doxy.me or treatment you provide a patient
while using doxy.me, you will be solely responsible and pay any such sums. [CLS] [SEP]

4\. [CLS] [SEP] virtual waiting room

the services available through the doxy.me site includes a virtual waiting
room ("virtual waiting room"). [CLS] [SEP] just like the waiting room in a physical
office, anyone can enter your virtual waiting room. [CLS] [SEP] as such, content posted on
your virtual waiting room is available to and can be viewed by anyone who
enters. [CLS] [SEP] the site provides you with the ability to post content on and links to
other sites through the virtual waiting room. [CLS] [SEP] the content which you post on
your virtual waiting room and the links to other sites you make available on
your virtual waiting room is yours and yours alone. [CLS] [SEP] provided that the content
posted is not in violation of section 1 of these terms of use, doxy.me will
not claim any rights or interests in such content. [CLS] [SEP] by posting such content or
links, you agree to be solely responsible for such content and links and agree
to defend, indemnify (if applicable and allowed by law) and hold doxy.me
harmless as provided of in section 11, below. [CLS] [SEP]

we are going to email you occasionally, and you’re okay with that. [CLS] [SEP]

5\. [CLS] [SEP] electronic communications

you consent to receive communications from us electronically. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
all agreements can be entered into and signed electronically in accordance
with applicable law, and all notices, disclosures, and other communications
that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
notice or other communications be in writing. [CLS] [SEP]

the content you post on your virtual waiting room and links to other sites you
include on your virtual waiting room are yours alone. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely
responsible for such content and links. [CLS] [SEP]

6\. [CLS] [SEP] site access; security and restrictions; passwords

you are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the
site, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for your
use or logging onto a server or an account which you are not authorized to

or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper
authorization; or (c) accessing or using the site or any portion thereof
without authorization, in violation of these terms of use or violation of
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are under 18 years of age, you may not access the site or use the
doxy.me services. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not use any scraper, crawler, spider, robot or other automated means
of any kind to access or copy data on the site, deep-link to any feature or
content on the site, bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we
may use to prevent or restrict access to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal
liability. [CLS] [SEP] doxy.me will investigate occurrences that may involve such
violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in
prosecuting users who are involved in such violations. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to use
any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the
proper working of this site or any activity being conducted on this site. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event access to the site or a portion, thereof is limited requiring a
user id and password (“protected areas”), you agree to access protected areas
using only your user id and password as provided to you by doxy.me. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
to protect the confidentiality of your user id and password, and not to share
or disclose your user id or password to any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you
are fully responsible for all activities occurring under your user id. [CLS] [SEP] your
access to the site may be revoked by doxy.me at any time with or without
cause. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to defend, indemnify (if applicable and allowed by law) and
hold doxy.me harmless from and against all third party claims, damages and
expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) against or incurred by doxy.me
arising out of your breach of these terms of use or violation of applicable
law, your use or access of the site, or access by anyone accessing the site
using your user id and password. [CLS] [SEP]

don’t attempt to hack the site. [CLS] [SEP] don’t share your username and password with
anyone. [CLS] [SEP] internet safety is important to us and for you. [CLS] [SEP]

7\. [CLS] [SEP] license and access; termination by doxy.me

subject to your compliance with these terms of use and your payment of any
applicable fees, doxy.me or its content providers grant you a limited, non-
exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make use
of the doxy.me services. [CLS] [SEP] in the event you have entered into a separate
platform subscription agreement or master services agreement with doxy.me (the
“services agreement”), the terms of the services agreement shall also apply to
your use of the site and the services. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a conflict between the
services agreement and these terms of use, the terms of the services agreement
shall prevail. [CLS] [SEP] all rights not expressly granted to you in these terms of use
or any service terms are reserved and retained by doxy.me or its licensors,
suppliers, publishers, rights holders, or other content providers. [CLS] [SEP] no doxy.me
service, nor any part of any doxy.me service may be reproduced, duplicated,
copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial
purpose except as expressly authorized in writing by doxy.me. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other
proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of
doxy.me without express written consent. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use any meta tags or any
other "hidden text" utilizing doxy.me's name or trademarks without the express
written consent of doxy.me. [CLS] [SEP] you may not misuse the doxy.me services. [CLS] [SEP] you may
use the doxy.me services only as permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] your access to the site and

to review the current terms of use, so you are aware of any such revisions to
which you are bound. [CLS] [SEP] certain provisions of these terms of use may be
superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on
particular pages within this site. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the site signifies your

be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms
of use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

we may occasionally update these terms, so check back in regularly. [CLS] [SEP]

18\. [CLS] [SEP] refund policy

our goal is for you to be successful when using doxy.me for telemedicine, but
we understand that technology doesn't always cooperate or that other issues
can arise, and as a result, we've made our [refund
policy](https://help.doxy.me/en/articles/3705909-our-refund-policy) as simple
as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

please let us know, and we'll make it right for you. [CLS] [SEP]

19\. [CLS] [SEP] shared security responsibilities

this site is meant to help transmit sensitive data and we've done our best to
protect that data in our hands. [CLS] [SEP] but you are also a part of the solution so:
use a strong password; do not share your login credentials; update your
software regularly; install and use anti-virus and firewall software (but
whitelist doxy.me!); do not use doxy.me in a public place and still expect
people can't hear what you are talking about. [CLS] [SEP]

be smart with your personal security choices. [CLS] [SEP]

20\. [CLS] [SEP] individual accounts and abuse

we offer a free service as a benefit to the community. [CLS] [SEP] when you let other
people share your account; delete your account and sign up again to get
another 30 free days; have your whole employee base on our free or pro plans
etc., you are taking advantage of our system. [CLS] [SEP] if we think you are doing this,
we'll probably warn you. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't respond or change behavior, we'll delete
your account and prevent you from using our site and services again. [CLS] [SEP] if you
have more than one (1) person, employee, or independent contractor in your
organization that has accounts with us, you must be on a clinic plan. [CLS] [SEP]

don't take advantage of us. [CLS] [SEP] it's very expensive to run a modern software
company and we have to pay the bills somehow right?
