please read the following terms and conditions before purchasing or using
yubico products, including but not limited to yubikey and yubihsm products
(“hardware) and [yubico validation
services](https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/yubicloud/),
including yubicloud (“validation service“) (collectively, the hardware and
validation service shall be referred to as “products”). [CLS] [SEP]

the terms and conditions of this sales and license agreement and the yubico
ordering document you executed or agreed to (“order form”) (this sales and
license agreement and the order form, collectively the “agreement”) are an
agreement between you and yubico and govern your usage of products unless you
and yubico have executed a separate written agreement governing your use of
products

“yubico” means: yubico, inc., 530 lytton avenue, suite 301, palo alto, ca
94301, u.s.a. [CLS] [SEP] if you are acquiring the products in the americas; and yubico
ab, kungsgatan 44 2nd floor. [CLS] [SEP] 111 35 stockholm, sweden, if you are acquiring
the products outside of the americas. [CLS] [SEP] references herein to the “parties” or a
“party” shall mean you and yubico, as applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

this is a legally binding agreement between you and yubico. [CLS] [SEP] by using products
or clicking “agree”, as applicable, you are stating that you fully understand,
agree to be bound by and accept all the terms and conditions of this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you are accepting this agreement on behalf of a company, you
represent that you are authorized to do so. [CLS] [SEP] if you purchased products as a
private person (“consumer purchaser”) directly from yubico’s online webstore
and do not accept the terms of this agreement, then you may not use the
products, and you may return such unused products to yubico, at your expense,
within 30 days of the date of delivery (with the order form and all original
unopened packaging and documentation) for a full refund of the purchase price. [CLS] [SEP]
if you are a consumer purchaser that purchased from other third-party vendors,
including retail stores, please contact those vendors directly for more
information about their refund policies. [CLS] [SEP]

**1\. [CLS] [SEP] use and restrictions**

(a) license grant. [CLS] [SEP] the hardware may contain certain object code software
deployed onto its secure hardware prior to delivery to the user (“firmware”)
and/or provided separately for use with the hardware (collectively, such
firmware and separately provided software being “software”). [CLS] [SEP] yubico grants you
a personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable and non-
transferable license to use the software solely as part of your use of the
hardware, in accordance with the published specifications for the product and
for your internal non-commercial use. [CLS] [SEP] you may use the firmware only as
originally deployed onto the hardware. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) restrictions. [CLS] [SEP] you shall not: (i) modify, translate or create derivative
works from the products; (ii) disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
perform cryptographic analysis on or otherwise attempt to derive the source
code of the products, in whole or in part, unless expressly permitted by
applicable law in the jurisdiction of use despite this prohibition; (iii)
disclose, publish or otherwise make publicly available any benchmark,
performance or comparison tests that you (or a third-party contracted by you)
run on the products, in whole or in part; (iv) separate the firmware from the
remainder of hardware or use the software on another device; (v) interfere
with, disrupt the integrity or performance of, or attempt to gain unauthorized
access to the validation service; (vi) sell, resell, distribute, transfer,
publish, disclose, rent, lend, lease or sublicense the products or its
software (for the avoidance of doubt, if you are acquiring products on behalf
of a company you may make the products available to your employees for use as
well as your affiliates and third-party contractors subject to section 1(d),
below); (vii) make the functionality of the products available to any third
party through any means, including without limitation by uploading the
software to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting,
application services provider, service bureau or other type of services; or
(viii) use, or make available, the validation service with non-yubico
products. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) optional items. [CLS] [SEP] from time-to-time, yubico at its sole discretion, may make
available to you optional items including but not limited to (i) optional
software utilities and beta software for supporting the usage of the hardware;
and (ii) pre-release hardware (collectively “optional items”). [CLS] [SEP] unless a
particular optional item includes its own separate and specific terms and
conditions, this agreement shall govern the usage of optional items. [CLS] [SEP]
conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this
agreement, yubico grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to
use the optional items solely in executable form and solely for your internal
business purposes of supporting the hardware, and in the case of pre-release
hardware, for evaluation purposes. [CLS] [SEP] optional items are not fully tested by
yubico and may include significant issues. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that optional items
are likely to present risks associated with their use. [CLS] [SEP] yubico strongly
recommends that you back up all your data prior to using optional items from
any source. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement,
optional items are provided “as is”, and do not carry any warranties or
maintenance or support; similarly, in no event shall yubico be liable for any
damage arising from the use of optional items. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) affiliates and third-party contractors. [CLS] [SEP] you may allow your “affiliates” to
use the products, provided that you shall (i) provide the affiliate with a
copy of the agreement; (ii) ensure that the affiliate complies with this
agreement; and (iii) be responsible for any breach by such affiliate. [CLS] [SEP]
“affiliate” means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with you or yubico, as applicable, where “control” means having
the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the
management of the entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] if you contract with a third-party contractor providing
it services solely for your benefit, they may use the products subject to
their compliance with this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] ownership**

the software is licensed not sold. [CLS] [SEP] all title to the software and other yubico
intellectual property rights related to the software such as, but not limited
to, copyright, trade secrets, patents, trademarks and service marks, shall
always remain with yubico and its licensors as applicable. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent you
provide any suggestions or comments related to the products, yubico shall have
the right to retain and use any such suggestions or comments in current or
future products or subscriptions, without your approval or compensation to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

**3\. [CLS] [SEP] support services and professional services**

if you have not purchased technical support services (“support services”) or
professional services (“professional services”) (collectively “services”)
pursuant to an order form, then yubico will have no obligation to provide
services to you. [CLS] [SEP] if yubico, in its sole discretion elects to provide support
services to assist you, it is provided on an “as is” basis without any
warranties, service levels or obligations; similarly, in no event shall yubico
be liable for any damage arising from providing such discretionary support
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you have purchased services, then they shall be governed by the
support services agreement and professional services agreement, as applicable,
located at [https://www.yubico.com/support/terms-conditions/](/support/terms-
conditions/). [CLS] [SEP]

**4\. [CLS] [SEP] payment, taxes, and delivery**

(a) reseller purchases. [CLS] [SEP] the entirety of this section 4 does not apply to you
if you purchased products from a yubico authorized distributor or reseller. [CLS] [SEP]
all commercial terms, including but not limited to payment, taxes, and
delivery shall be determined and settled between you and such distributor or
reseller. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
(b) yubico webstore purchases. [CLS] [SEP] if you are purchasing from the yubico online

purchase or in the applicable invoice. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **prices on the yubico webstore:** are exclusive of applicable vat, sales
tax, import duties, shipping fees and customs fees. [CLS] [SEP] vat or sales tax will be
added before the order confirmation, if applicable. [CLS] [SEP] to allow you to determine

contact us by opening a support ticket here
<https://support.yubico.com/support/tickets/new> to determine the country we
will ship from. [CLS] [SEP] shipping fees will vary based on the location of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]  
 **shipping country:** will be determined after order is placed. [CLS] [SEP] for specific
information on what country your order is shipped from, please contact us by
opening a support ticket here
<https://support.yubico.com/support/tickets/new>. [CLS] [SEP] usually, if the delivery
country is in the americas, we ship from the usa, otherwise we ship from
sweden. [CLS] [SEP] if the delivery address is in the european union, we will ship from
within the european union. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
(c) yubico direct sales. [CLS] [SEP]  
(i) payment. [CLS] [SEP] if you are purchasing from yubico by entering into a written
order form, you will pay yubico the total fees specified in the order form. [CLS] [SEP]
fees will be due 30 days from invoice date, provided that yubico reserves the
right in its sole discretion to require prepayment from you if you do not have
a well-established transaction history with yubico or if you for instance have
exhibited questionable credit worthiness or have failed to adhere to payment
terms for prior yubico purchases. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you understand and accept that
yubico may at any time sell any outstanding debt to a third party. [CLS] [SEP] further,
yubico reserves the right to require payment be made by electronic means
including but not limited to ach/eft or wire transfer. [CLS] [SEP] all sums that are past
due will accrue interest at the highest rate permissible by applicable law and
you will reimburse yubico for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in collecting any overdue amounts. [CLS] [SEP] all
fees are non-refundable unless otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP] prices quoted are
exclusive of all sales, use, value-added, good and services, withholding and
other taxes or duties. [CLS] [SEP]  
(ii) taxes. [CLS] [SEP] you will pay or self-assess all taxes and duties assessed in
connection with this agreement and its performance, except for taxes payable
on yubico’s net income. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent that any amounts payable by you are
subject to withholding taxes, the amount payable shall be grossed up such that
the amount paid to yubico’s net of withholding taxes equals the amount
invoiced by yubico. [CLS] [SEP] if you pay any withholding taxes based on payments made by
you to yubico hereunder, you will furnish yubico with written documentation of
all such tax payments, including receipts and other customary documentation,
to demonstrate to the relevant tax authorities that you have paid such taxes. [CLS] [SEP]
if applicable, you shall also provide yubico with appropriate vat/gst
registration numbers and other documentation satisfactory to the applicable
taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of exemption from any tax or
duties. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of
any future functionality or features (including future availability of
products or any new releases), or dependent on any oral or written public
comments made by yubico regarding future functionality or features. [CLS] [SEP]  
(iii) transaction entities. [CLS] [SEP] if you are making global purchases from yubico
(i.e. [CLS] [SEP] purchases both in the americas and outside of the americas), by entering
into this agreement, you on behalf of your affiliates, agree that yubico and
its regional affiliates may invoice your respective regional affiliates that
are benefiting from the products in the joint effort of increasing tax
efficiencies as permitted by applicable law and to adhere to established
accounting practices. [CLS] [SEP] you represent that you are authorized to bind your
regional affiliates to being invoiced by yubico and its regional affiliates. [CLS] [SEP]
when fulfilling delivery requests for such regional affiliates, yubico may
require such regional affiliates to complete a fulfillment request form or
similar document for formalizing order confirmation. [CLS] [SEP]  
(iv) delivery. [CLS] [SEP] all products that require shipping will be shipped free carrier
(incoterms 2010 fca) yubico’s designated shipping point. [CLS] [SEP] you will be
responsible for shipping expenses and will arrange to have your carrier pick
up and deliver your purchased products. [CLS] [SEP]

**5\. [CLS] [SEP] limited warranty, exclusions, disclaimer**

(a) warranty. [CLS] [SEP] yubico warrants that the hardware will be free from defects in
material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of delivery to
the original purchaser who has purchased hardware from yubico or its
authorized resellers (the “warranty period”) (such warranty being the “limited
warranty”). [CLS] [SEP] if a defect in material or workmanship arises within the hardware
during the warranty period and the hardware is returned to yubico within the
warranty period, yubico will, at its sole option and subject to applicable
laws: (a) repair or replace any defective hardware with a new or refurbished
product; or (b) refund the original purchase price of the hardware. [CLS] [SEP] the
warranty period for any repaired or replacement hardware will persist for the
longer of the remainder of the original one-year warranty period or 90 days
from the date the repaired or replacement product is shipped to the user. [CLS] [SEP] this
section 5(a) sets forth yubico’s sole obligation and your sole remedy for any
breach of this limited warranty. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) exclusions. [CLS] [SEP] the limited warranty extends only to the original purchaser of
the hardware and is non-transferrable. [CLS] [SEP] this warranty does not apply to
hardware that: (a) is altered or modified, other than by yubico; (b) is not
maintained in a normal and customary fashion or is operated outside of
yubico’s recommended guidelines; (c) has been subjected to abnormal physical
or electrical stress, misuse, negligence or accident; (d) has had its original
serial number altered or removed, other than as a result of normal wear and
tear; or (e) yubico has provided free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) warranty disclaimer. [CLS] [SEP] except for the limited warranty expressly stated in
section 5 (a) above and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
products are provided “as is”. [CLS] [SEP] yubico and its suppliers make no other
warranties and expressly disclaim all other warranties, express or implied,
including without limitation any implied warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties arising out of course of
dealing or usage of trade. [CLS] [SEP] yubico does not warrant that (a) the products will
meet your requirements, (b) use thereof shall be uninterrupted or error-free,
(c) the products or any equipment, system or network on which the products are
used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or attack, or (d) or that all

exhibit a

**agreement to arbitrate – u.s. [CLS] [SEP] consumer purchaser**. [CLS] [SEP]

**(a) general:**  
if you are a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] resident that has acquired products as a consumer purchaser,
you and yubico agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to this agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement,
interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the software (collectively,
“disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party
retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and
(ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described
in the foregoing clause (ii), an “ip protection action”). [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the
preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other dispute
if you provide yubico with written notice of your desire to do so by email to
legal@yubico.com within 30 days following the date you first purchase or
obtain the software (such notice, an “arbitration opt-out notice”). [CLS] [SEP] if you
don’t provide yubico with an arbitration opt-out notice within the 30-day
period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your
right to litigate any dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) above. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any ip protection action
or, if you timely provide client with an arbitration opt-out notice, will be
the state and federal courts located in the northern district of california
and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue
in such courts. [CLS] [SEP] unless you timely provide client with an arbitration opt-out
notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and yubico are each waiving the
right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in
any purported class action or representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] further, unless both
you and yubico otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate
more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of
any class or representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if this specific paragraph is held
unenforceable, then the entirety of this section will be deemed void. [CLS] [SEP] except
as provided in the preceding sentence, this section will survive any
termination of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**(b) arbitration rules:**  
the arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration association
(“aaa”) in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules and the
supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (the “aaa rules”) then
in effect, except as modified by this section. [CLS] [SEP] (the aaa rules are available at
www.adr.org/rules or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879.) the federal
arbitration act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
section. [CLS] [SEP]

**(c) arbitration process:**  
a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with
a written demand for arbitration as specified in the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] (the aaa
provides a general demand for arbitration and a separate demand for
arbitration for california residents). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will be either a retired
judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the
parties from the aaa’s roster of arbitrators. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties are unable to
agree upon an arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the demand for
arbitration, then the aaa will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the
aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**(d) arbitration location and procedure:**  
unless you and yubico otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in
the county where you reside. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the
arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you
and yubico submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim exceeds
$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] subject
to the aaa rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
expedited nature of the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**(e) arbitrator’s decision:**  
the arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the aaa
rules. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. [CLS] [SEP] judgment on the
arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of section 8
(“limitation of liability”) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a
party may be held liable. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] if you prevail in
arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses,
to the extent provided under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] yubico will not seek, and hereby
waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees
and expenses if it prevails in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**(f) fees:**  
your responsibility to pay any aaa filing, administrative and arbitrator fees
will be solely as set forth in the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] however, if your claim for
damages does not exceed $75,000, yubico will pay all such fees unless the
arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper
purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil
procedure 11(b)). [CLS] [SEP]
