#  grand jury subpoena for signal user data, eastern district of virginia

04 oct 2016

in the “first half of 2016” (the most specific we’re permitted to be), we
received a subpoena from the eastern district of virginia. [CLS] [SEP] the subpoena
required us to provide information about two signal users for a federal grand
jury investigation. [CLS] [SEP]

we’ve designed the signal service to minimize the data we retain about signal
users, so the only information we can produce in response to a request like
this is the date and time a user registered with signal and the last date of a
user’s connectivity to the signal service. [CLS] [SEP]

notably, things we _don’t_ have stored include anything about a user’s
contacts (such as the contacts themselves, a hash of the contacts, any other
derivative contact information), anything about a user’s groups (such as how
many groups a user is in, which groups a user is in, the membership lists of a
user’s groups), or any records of who a user has been communicating with. [CLS] [SEP]

all message contents are end-to-end encrypted, so we don’t have that
information either. [CLS] [SEP]

this is the first subpoena that we’ve received. [CLS] [SEP] it originally included a broad
gag order that would have prevented us from publishing this notice, but the
aclu represented us in [quickly and successfully securing our ability to
publish the transcripts below](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/new-
documents-reveal-government-effort-impose-secrecy-encryption-company). [CLS] [SEP] we’re
committed to treating any future requests the same way: working with effective
and talented organizations like the aclu, and [publishing transcripts of our
responses to government requests here](/bigbrother/). [CLS] [SEP]

below is the transcript for this request. [CLS] [SEP]

 **edit** : _the documents below have been updated to remove redactions that
are no longer required._
