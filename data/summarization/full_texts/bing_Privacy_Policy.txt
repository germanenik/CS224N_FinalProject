how we use personal datahow we use personal datamainhowweusepersonaldatamodule

summary

microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive
experiences. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, we use data to:

  * provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. [CLS] [SEP] it also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request. [CLS] [SEP]
  * improve and develop our products. [CLS] [SEP]
  * personalize our products and make recommendations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our
performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and
doing research. [CLS] [SEP]

in carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different
contexts (for example, from your use of two microsoft products) or obtain from
third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized
experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and
manual (human) methods of processing. [CLS] [SEP] our automated methods often are related
to and supported by our manual methods. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our automated methods
include artificial intelligence (ai), which we think of as a set of
technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in
decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. [CLS] [SEP]
to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of
processing (including ai), we manually review some of the predictions and
inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from
which the predictions and inferences were made. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we manually
review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to
improve our speech recognition technologies. [CLS] [SEP] this manual review may be
conducted by microsoft employees or vendors who are working on microsoftâs
behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

for these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for
example, from your use of two microsoft products). [CLS] [SEP] for example cortana may use
information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email,
and microsoft store uses information about the apps and services you use to
make personalized app recommendations. [CLS] [SEP] however, we have built in technological
and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where
required by law. [CLS] [SEP] for example, where required by law, we store data we collect
from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any
account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email
address, or phone number. [CLS] [SEP]

our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and
manual (human) methods of processing. [CLS] [SEP] our automated methods often are related
to and supported by our manual methods. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our automated methods

improve our speech recognition technologies. [CLS] [SEP] this manual review may be
conducted by microsoft employees or vendors who are working on microsoftâs
behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

when we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as
required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our
contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our
customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of microsoft as described in
this section and in the reasons we share personal dataâ section of this
privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] when we transfer personal data from the european economic
area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the
where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

**more on the purposes of processing:**

  *  **provide our products**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you use onedrive, we process the documents you upload to onedrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. [CLS] [SEP] or, for example, if you enter a search query in the bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. [CLS] [SEP] we also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **product improvement**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **personalization**. [CLS] [SEP] many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. [CLS] [SEP] these features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. [CLS] [SEP] for example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the microsoft store that streams more efficiently. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. [CLS] [SEP] many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **product activation**. [CLS] [SEP] we use dataâsuch as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiersâto activate products that require activation. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **product development**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to develop new products. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customersâ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **customer support**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customersâ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. [CLS] [SEP] call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **help secure and troubleshoot**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.

  * **safety**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. [CLS] [SEP] our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. [CLS] [SEP] for example, some of our products, such as outlook or onedrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or urls that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.

  * **promotional communications**. [CLS] [SEP] we use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. [CLS] [SEP] you can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from microsoft by email, sms, physical mail, and telephone.

[CLS] [SEP] for example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. [CLS] [SEP] we may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **legal compliance**. [CLS] [SEP] we process data to comply with law. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect childrenâs privacy. [CLS] [SEP] we also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights. [CLS] [SEP]

finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal
data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in
outlook.com, or files in private folders on onedrive), when we have a good
faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:

  * comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies. [CLS] [SEP]

 **your communications preferences**

you can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from
microsoft by email, sms, physical mail, and telephone. [CLS] [SEP] if you receive
promotional email or sms messages from us and would like to opt out, you can
do so by following the directions in that message. [CLS] [SEP] you can also make choices
about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by
signing in with your personal microsoft account, and viewing your
[communication permissions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=243191)
where you can update contact information, manage microsoft-wide contact
preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your
contact information with microsoft partners. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not have a personal

choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of
certain microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other
informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method. [CLS] [SEP]

**your advertising choices**

to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from microsoft, visit our
[opt-out page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=286759). [CLS] [SEP] when you opt
out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser
you are using. [CLS] [SEP] the opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. [CLS] [SEP] if you
delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also link your opt-out choice with your personal microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] it
will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to
apply until someone signs in with a different personal microsoft account on
that device. [CLS] [SEP] if you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign
in again for the settings to apply. [CLS] [SEP]

for microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on windows, you may
use the opt-out linked to your personal microsoft account, or opt out of
interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising id in windows
settings. [CLS] [SEP]

because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other
required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud
detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data
collection. [CLS] [SEP] you will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant
to you. [CLS] [SEP]

you can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we
partner with by visiting their sites (see above). [CLS] [SEP]

 **browser-based controls**

when you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain
features. [CLS] [SEP] for example:

  *  **cookie controls**. [CLS] [SEP] you can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the cookies section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **tracking protections**. [CLS] [SEP] you can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using tracking protection in internet explorer (versions 9 and up) and microsoft edge. [CLS] [SEP] this feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a tracking protection list you add. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **browser controls for "do not track."** some browsers have incorporated "do not track" (dnt) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. [CLS] [SEP] because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the dnt signal, microsoft services do not currently respond to browser dnt signals. [CLS] [SEP] we continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat dnt signals. [CLS] [SEP] in the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from microsoft as described above. [CLS] [SEP]

 **our use of cookies and similar technologies**

microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes,
depending on the context or product, including:

  *  **storing your preferences and settings**. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. [CLS] [SEP] for example, depending on your settings, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a microsoft website, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. [CLS] [SEP] saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **sign-in and authentication**. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to authenticate you. [CLS] [SEP] when you sign in to a website using your personal microsoft account, we store a unique id number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. [CLS] [SEP] this cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. [CLS] [SEP] you can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **security**. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **storing information you provide to a website**. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to remember information you shared.

[CLS] [SEP]
  *  **social media**. [CLS] [SEP] some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **feedback**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **interest-based advertising**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from microsoft as described in the how to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] where required, we obtain your opt-in consent to use cookies for behavioral advertising. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **showing advertising**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen, for example, so you donât see the same one repeatedly. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **analytics**. [CLS] [SEP] we use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **performance**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps ensure that our websites remain up and running. [CLS] [SEP]

some of the cookies we commonly use are listed below. [CLS] [SEP] this list is not
exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the primary purposes for which we
typically set cookies. [CLS] [SEP] if you visit one of our websites, the site will set
some or all of the following cookies:

  *  **mscc**. [CLS] [SEP] contains user choices for most microsoft properties. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **muid, mc1, and msfpc**. [CLS] [SEP] identifies unique web browsers visiting microsoft sites. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies are used for advertising, site analytics, and other operational purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **anon**. [CLS] [SEP] contains the anid, a unique identifier derived from your microsoft account, which is used for advertising, personalization, and operational purposes. [CLS] [SEP] it is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of interest-based advertising from microsoft if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **cc**. [CLS] [SEP] contains a country code as determined from your ip address. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **ppauth, mspauth, msnrpsauth, kievrpsauth, wlssc, mspprof**. [CLS] [SEP] helps to authenticate you when you sign in with your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **mc0**. [CLS] [SEP] detects whether cookies are enabled in the browser. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **ms0**. [CLS] [SEP] identifies a specific session. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **nap**. [CLS] [SEP] contains an encrypted version of your country, postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your microsoft account profile. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **mh**. [CLS] [SEP] appears on co-branded sites where microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. [CLS] [SEP] this cookie identifies the advertiser, so the right ad is selected. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **childinfo, kcdob, kcrelid, kcru, pcfm**. [CLS] [SEP] contains information that microsoft account uses within its pages in relation to child accounts. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **mr**. [CLS] [SEP] this cookie is used by microsoft to reset or refresh the muid cookie. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **x-ms-gateway-slice**. [CLS] [SEP] identifies a gateway for load balancing. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **toptout**. [CLS] [SEP] records your decision not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] where required, we place this cookie by default and remove it when you consent to interest-based advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition to the cookies microsoft sets when you visit our websites, third
parties can also set cookies when you visit microsoft sites. [CLS] [SEP] for example:

  * companies we hire to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, place cookies when you visit our sites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * companies that deliver content, such as videos or news, or ads on microsoft sites, place cookies on their own. [CLS] [SEP] these companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services. [CLS] [SEP]

for a list of the third parties that set cookies on our websites, including
service providers acting on our behalf, please visit our [third-party cookies
page](/privacystatement-third-party-cookies). [CLS] [SEP] on some of our websites, a list
of third parties is available directly on the site. [CLS] [SEP] the third parties on these
sites may not be included in the list on our [third-party cookies
page](/privacystatement-third-party-cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

 **how to control cookies**

most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow
you to block or delete them. [CLS] [SEP] for example, in microsoft edge, you can block or
delete cookies by selecting **settings** > **privacy and services** > **clear
browsing data** > **cookies and other site data**. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about
how to delete your cookies in microsoft browsers, see [microsoft

browserâs instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

where required, we obtain your consent before placing optional cookies that
are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website or (ii) for the purpose
of facilitating a communication. [CLS] [SEP] we separate these optional cookies by
purpose, such as for advertising and social media purposes. [CLS] [SEP] you may consent to
certain categories of optional cookies and not others. [CLS] [SEP] you also may adjust
your choices by clicking âmanage cookiesâ in the footer of the website or
through the settings made available on the website. [CLS] [SEP] certain features of
microsoft products depend on cookies. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to block cookies, you
cannot sign in or use some of those features, and preferences that are
dependent on cookies will be lost. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to delete cookies, any

 **our use of web beacons and analytics services**

some microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we
use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited
those websites, and deliver co-branded products. [CLS] [SEP] we also include web beacons
or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether
you open and act on them. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with
other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their
advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] this helps us to, for example, develop statistics on how often
clicking on an advertisement on a microsoft website results in a purchase or
other action on the advertiser's website. [CLS] [SEP] it also allows us to understand your
activity on the website of a microsoft partner in connection with your use of
a microsoft product or service. [CLS] [SEP]

finally, microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies
from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated
statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other
operations. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read
their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can
collect information about your online activities across applications,
websites, or other products. [CLS] [SEP] however, we prohibit these analytics providers
from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that
directly identifies you (such as your name or email address you can opt out of
data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by visiting any of
the following sites: [adjust](https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/),
[appsflyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/optout),
[clicktale](https://www.clicktale.net/disable.html), [flurry

[optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/legal/opt-out/). [CLS] [SEP]

**other similar technologies**

in addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use
other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. [CLS] [SEP] this
is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and
performance by storing certain files locally. [CLS] [SEP] but, like standard cookies,
these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which
can then track behavior. [CLS] [SEP] these technologies include local shared objects (or
"flash cookies") and silverlight application storage. [CLS] [SEP]

 **local shared objects or "flash cookies."** websites that use adobe flash
technologies can use local shared objects or "flash cookies" to store data on
your computer. [CLS] [SEP] to learn how to manage or block flash cookies, go to the [flash
player help
page](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). [CLS] [SEP]

 **silverlight application storage**. [CLS] [SEP] websites or applications that use
microsoft silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using
silverlight application storage. [CLS] [SEP] to learn how to manage or block such storage,
see the silverlight section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

center in another region. [CLS] [SEP] the storage location(s) are chosen in order to
operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in
order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. [CLS] [SEP] we take
steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is
processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements
of applicable law wherever the data is located. [CLS] [SEP]

we transfer personal data from the european economic area, the united kingdom,
and switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined
by the european commission to have an adequate level of data protection. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be
a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your
complaints. [CLS] [SEP] when we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal
mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses
published by the european commission under commission decision 2004/915/ec, to
help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more

the judgment of the court of justice of the eu in case c-311/18. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft
corporation has certified to the department of commerce that it adheres to the
privacy shield principles. [CLS] [SEP] if third-party agents process personal data on our

our retention of personal dataour retention of personal
datamainourretentionofpersonaldatamodule

summary

microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the
products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other
legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving
disputes, and enforcing our agreements. [CLS] [SEP] because these needs can vary for
different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of
products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. [CLS] [SEP]

other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:

  *  **do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?** examples include a document you store in onedrive, or an email message you keep in your outlook.com inbox. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your outlook.com inbox to the deleted items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your deleted items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). [CLS] [SEP] (note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)
  *  **is there an automated control, such as in the microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?** if there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **is the personal data of a sensitive type?** if so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **has microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?** for example, for bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the ip address after 6 months, and cookie ids and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?** if so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **is microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?** examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. [CLS] [SEP] conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so. [CLS] [SEP]

of the features as well as information about your communications, including
the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the
communication. [CLS] [SEP]

 **teams profile**. [CLS] [SEP] your teams profile includes information you provided when
you set up a microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] to enable other people to find you on teams
(or products that interact with teams for personal use, including teams for
enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on teams
that have your contact information. [CLS] [SEP]

**teams contacts**. [CLS] [SEP] with your permission, teams will sync your device contacts
periodically and check for other teams users that match contacts in your
deviceâs address book. [CLS] [SEP] you are always in control of your contacts and can
stop syncing at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to stop syncing your device contacts,
any device contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization
process will be deleted from teams. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to invite any of your device
contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or
microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via sms or email for
invitations to group conversations. [CLS] [SEP] you can block users if you donât want to
receive their communications; additionally you can report a concern to
microsoft. [CLS] [SEP]

 **location sharing**. [CLS] [SEP] you can share your static or live location with
individuals or groups within teams. [CLS] [SEP] you are in control and can stop sharing at
any time. [CLS] [SEP] sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and
in groups where an adult from the microsoft family group is present. [CLS] [SEP]

 **push notifications**. [CLS] [SEP] to let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other
messages, teams uses the notification service on your device. [CLS] [SEP] for many
devices, these services are provided by another company. [CLS] [SEP] to tell you who is

onedriveonedrivemainonedrivemodule

summary

onedrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. [CLS] [SEP] you can
also share and collaborate on your files with others. [CLS] [SEP] some versions of the
onedrive application enable you to access both your personal onedrive by
signing in with your personal microsoft account and your onedrive for business
by signing in with your work or school microsoft account as part of your
organization's use of microsoft 365 or office 365. [CLS] [SEP]

when you use onedrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as
well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. [CLS] [SEP]
examples include indexing the contents of your onedrive documents so that you
can search for them later and using location information to enable you to
search for photos based on where the photo was taken. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect device
information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you
to sync content across devices and roam customized settings. [CLS] [SEP]

when you store content in onedrive, that content will inherit the sharing
permissions of the folder in which you store it. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you decide to
store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available
to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. [CLS] [SEP] if you store content in a
private folder, the content will be private. [CLS] [SEP]

when you share content to a social network like facebook from a device that
you have synced with your onedrive account, your content is either uploaded to
that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social
network. [CLS] [SEP] doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social
network. [CLS] [SEP] to delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network
(if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from onedrive. [CLS] [SEP]

when you share your onedrive content with your friends via a link, an email
with the link is sent to those friends. [CLS] [SEP] the link contains an authorization
code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. [CLS] [SEP] if one of your
friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your
content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. [CLS] [SEP] to revoke
permissions for your content on onedrive, sign in to your account and then
select the specific content to manage the permission levels. [CLS] [SEP] revoking
permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. [CLS] [SEP] no one will be able
to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link
again. [CLS] [SEP]

files managed with onedrive for business are stored separately from files
stored with your personal onedrive. [CLS] [SEP] onedrive for business collects and
transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and
password, which will be transmitted to microsoft and/or to the provider of
your microsoft 365 or office 365 service. [CLS] [SEP]

outlookoutlookmainoutlookmodule

summary

outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved
communications and include outlook.com, outlook applications, and related
services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **outlook.com**. [CLS] [SEP] outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from
microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com,
live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. [CLS] [SEP] outlook.com provides features that let you
connect with your friends on social networks. [CLS] [SEP] you will need to create a
microsoft account to use outlook.com. [CLS] [SEP]

when you delete an email or item from a mailbox in outlook.com, the item
generally goes into your deleted items folder where it remains for
approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the
folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes
first. [CLS] [SEP] when the deleted items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in
our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally
required to retain the data for longer. [CLS] [SEP]

 **outlook applications**. [CLS] [SEP] outlook client applications are software you
install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items,
files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services,
like exchange online or outlook.com, or servers, like microsoft exchange. [CLS] [SEP] you
can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party
providers, with outlook applications. [CLS] [SEP]

to add an account, you must provide permission for outlook to access data from
the email or file storage services. [CLS] [SEP]

when you add an account to outlook, your mail, calendar items, files,
contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to
your device. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using the mobile outlook application, that data will
also sync to microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster
search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add
email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the
outlook application. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using the desktop outlook application, you can
choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. [CLS] [SEP] at any time, you can
remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your
account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or
school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and
controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to
remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of outlook. [CLS] [SEP]

to learn more about the data the outlook applications collect and process,
please see the microsoft 365 section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

bingbingmainbingmodule

summary

bing services include search and mapping services, as well as the bing toolbar
and bing desktop apps. [CLS] [SEP] bing services collect and process data in many forms,
including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images. [CLS] [SEP] bing
services are also included within other microsoft services, such as microsoft
365, cortana, and certain features in windows (which we refer to as bing-
powered experiences). [CLS] [SEP]

when you conduct a search, or use a feature of a bing-powered experience that
involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, microsoft
will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of
text, voice data, or an image), along with your ip address, location, the
unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time
and date of your search, and your browser configuration. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you
use bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data
associated with the speech functionality will be sent to microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] to learn
more about how microsoft manages your voice data, see speech recognition
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] and, if you use bing image-enabled services, the image you
provide will be sent to microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] when you use bing-powered experiences, such
as bing lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or
document, that word or phrase is sent to bing along with some surrounding
content in order to provide contextually relevant search results. [CLS] [SEP]

**search suggestions**. [CLS] [SEP] for the search suggestions feature, the characters
that you type into a bing-powered experience (such as search and site
suggestions in the microsoft edge browser) to conduct a search and what you
click on will be sent to microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] this allows us to provide you with
relevant suggestions as you type your searches. [CLS] [SEP] to turn this feature on or
off, while using bing search, go to [bing
settings](https://www.bing.com/account/general). [CLS] [SEP] there are other methods to
control this feature in other bing-powered experiences, such as the microsoft
edge browser. [CLS] [SEP] search suggestions cannot be turned off in the windows 10 search
box. [CLS] [SEP] on windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the
feature. [CLS] [SEP]

**bing experience improvement program for bing desktop and bing toolbar**. [CLS] [SEP] if
you are using bing desktop or bing toolbar and choose to participate in the
bing experience improvement program, we also collect additional data about how
you use these specific bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you
visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. [CLS] [SEP] to help protect your
privacy, we do not use the data collected through the bing experience
improvement program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. [CLS] [SEP]
you can turn off the bing experience improvement program at any time in the
bing desktop or bing toolbar settings. [CLS] [SEP] finally, we delete the information
collected through the bing experience improvement program after 18 months. [CLS] [SEP]

**retention and de-identification**. [CLS] [SEP] we de-identify stored search queries by
removing the entirety of the ip address after 6 months, and cookie ids and
other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account
or device after 18 months. [CLS] [SEP]

**personalization through microsoft account**. [CLS] [SEP] some bing services provide you
with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal microsoft
account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. [CLS] [SEP] you can use
these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and
settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. [CLS] [SEP] visit [bing
settings](https://www.bing.com/account/general) to manage your personalization
settings, or the [microsoft privacy
dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy) to manage your data. [CLS] [SEP]

**managing search history**. [CLS] [SEP] when youâre signed-in to a personal microsoft
account, you can erase your search history on the [microsoft privacy
dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] the search history service
from bing, located in bing settings, provides another method of revisiting the
search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using bing search
through your browser. [CLS] [SEP] you may clear your search history on a device through
this service. [CLS] [SEP] clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed
on the search history site, but does not delete information from our search
logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have
instructed through the privacy dashboard. [CLS] [SEP] if you are signed-in to a work or
school microsoft account using microsoft search in bing, you can export your
microsoft search in bing search history, but you cannot delete it. [CLS] [SEP] your
microsoft search in bing service administrator can see aggregated search
history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user. [CLS] [SEP]

**third-party services that use bing**. [CLS] [SEP] you may access bing-powered
experiences when using third-party services, such as those from yahoo!. [CLS] [SEP] in
order to provide these services, bing receives data from these and other
partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, ip
address, and a unique identifier). [CLS] [SEP] this data will be sent to microsoft to
provide the search service. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft will use this data as described in this
statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our
partners. [CLS] [SEP] you should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services
for any questions about how they collect and use data. [CLS] [SEP]

**data passed to destination website**. [CLS] [SEP] when you select a search result or
advertisement from a bing search results page and go to the destination
website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser
sends to every web site you visitâsuch as your ip address, browser type and
language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case,
<https://www.bing.com/>). [CLS] [SEP]

**sharing data from bing and bing-powered experiences with third parties**. [CLS] [SEP] we
share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is
not known) from bing and bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. [CLS] [SEP]
before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain
sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves
(such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we
require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data
for purposes other than for which it is provided. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] 
  * **device and usage data**. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information about your device as well as the hardware and software you use. [CLS] [SEP] for example, cortana can access data about your device and how you use it. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, cortana can determine if bluetooth is on, whether youâve locked your screen, your alarm settings, and which apps you install and use. [CLS] [SEP] 

if you sign in with your microsoft account, you can enable cortana to perform
additional tasks and to provide personalized experiences and suggestions. [CLS] [SEP]
cortana can process the demographic data (such as your age, address, and
gender) associated with your microsoft account and data collected through
other microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions. [CLS] [SEP] cortana also
learns your favorite places from the microsoft maps app, and what you view and
purchase in microsoft store to improve suggestions. [CLS] [SEP] your interests in the
cortana notebook can be used by other microsoft services, such as bing or msn,
to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences
as well. [CLS] [SEP]

when you sign in to cortana, in addition to the information described above,
we also collect:

 **location data**. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose whether cortana processes your location
information to give you relevant notices and results and to make suggestions
such as local traffic information and location-based reminders. [CLS] [SEP] if you grant
permission, cortana will regularly collect and use your current location,
location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on
photos you upload to onedrive). [CLS] [SEP] location data cortana collects is used to
provide you with personalized experiences across our products, such as making

summary

the microsoft swiftkey keyboard and related cloud-based services
(collectively, the âswiftkey servicesâ) process data about words you use
and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide
personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you. [CLS] [SEP] we also
use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji
predictions. [CLS] [SEP]

swiftkey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a
personalized language model. [CLS] [SEP] this model is an optimized view of the words and
phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing
style. [CLS] [SEP] the model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way
that enables swiftkeyâs algorithms to make predictions, based on text you
have already entered. [CLS] [SEP] the model draws from all scenarios in which you use your
keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. [CLS] [SEP] the
swiftkey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not
collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing
password or payment data. [CLS] [SEP] swiftkey services do not log, store, or learn from
data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share
your data with us (as described further below). [CLS] [SEP] when you use swiftkey
services, we also collect device and usage data. [CLS] [SEP] we use de-identified device
and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products. [CLS] [SEP]

the swiftkey services also include an optional cloud component called a
swiftkey account. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to create a swiftkey account, your language
model will be synced with the swiftkey account cloud service, so you can
benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional
services such as prediction synchronization and backup. [CLS] [SEP] when you create a
swiftkey account, microsoft will also collect your email address and basic
demographic data. [CLS] [SEP] all data collected is transferred to our servers over
encrypted channels. [CLS] [SEP]

you may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips
for the purposes of improving microsoft products and services. [CLS] [SEP] depending on
the opt-ins you choose, swiftkey may send short snippets of data about what
and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our
servers for processing. [CLS] [SEP] these text snippets and/or voice clips are used in
various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are
working correctly and to make product improvements. [CLS] [SEP] to preserve your privacy,
swiftkey services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a
swiftkey account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to
it. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about how microsoft manages your voice data, see speech
recognition technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

if you sign into your swiftkey account and opt to share your language and
typing data or voice clips, microsoft will process your shared data in order
to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base. [CLS] [SEP] this allows
us to improve our basic models for individual languages. [CLS] [SEP] language and typing
data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words
that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered
out. [CLS] [SEP]

you can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice
clips for product improvement at any time in swiftkey settings. [CLS] [SEP] you can also
withdraw your consent for swiftkey services to retain your personal data in
swiftkey settings. [CLS] [SEP] when you withdraw consent for swiftkey to retain your
personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the swiftkey

advertising idadvertising idmainadvertisingidmodule

summary

windows generates a unique advertising id for each person using a device,
which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own
purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps. [CLS] [SEP] when the
advertising id is enabled, both microsoft apps and third-party apps can access
and use the advertising id in much the same way that websites can access and
use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. [CLS] [SEP] thus, your advertising id can be
used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant
advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the
web. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft collects the advertising id for the uses described here only
when you choose to enable the advertising id as part of your privacy setting. [CLS] [SEP]

the advertising id setting applies to windows apps using the windows
advertising identifier. [CLS] [SEP] you can turn off access to this identifier at any time
by turning off the advertising id in settings. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to turn it on
again, the advertising id will be reset and a new identifier will be

diagnosticsdiagnosticsmaindiagnosticsmodule

summary

microsoft collects windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep
windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. [CLS] [SEP] it also helps us improve
windows and related microsoft products and services and, for customers who
have turned on the âtailored experiencesâ setting, to provide more
relevant tips and recommendations to tailor microsoft and third-party products
and services for windows to the customerâs needs. [CLS] [SEP] this data is transmitted
to microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us
recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the
device's service issues and use patterns. [CLS] [SEP]

there are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: required diagnostic data
and optional diagnostic data. [CLS] [SEP] certain product documentation and other
materials refer to required diagnostic data as basic diagnostic data and to
optional diagnostic data as full diagnostic data. [CLS] [SEP]

if an organization (such as your employer or school) uses microsoft management
tools or engages microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will
use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the
management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and
for other purposes of the organization. [CLS] [SEP]

 **required diagnostic data** includes information about your device, its
settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. [CLS] [SEP] we collect
the following required diagnostic data:

  * device, connectivity, and configuration data: 
    * data about the device such as the processor type, oem manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes. [CLS] [SEP]
    * network capabilities and connection data such as the deviceâs ip address, mobile network (including imei and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network. [CLS] [SEP]
    * data about the operating system and its configuration such as the os version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the windows insider program. [CLS] [SEP]
    * data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data. [CLS] [SEP]
    * data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher. [CLS] [SEP]
  * whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network. [CLS] [SEP]
  * whether updates complete successfully or fail. [CLS] [SEP]
  * data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself. [CLS] [SEP]
  * basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. [CLS] [SEP] for example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as microsoft paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes. [CLS] [SEP]

 **optional diagnostic data** includes more detailed information about your
device and its settings, capabilities, and device health. [CLS] [SEP] optional diagnostic
data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also
sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps
microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. [CLS] [SEP] when you
choose to send optional diagnostic data, required diagnostic data will always
be included, and we collect the following additional information:

  * additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under required diagnostic data. [CLS] [SEP]
  * status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under required diagnostic data. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * app activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in microsoft browsers (microsoft edge or internet explorer). [CLS] [SEP] 
  * enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). [CLS] [SEP] crash data is never used for tailored experiences as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if
you choose to send optional diagnostic data. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft minimizes the volume of
optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of
the data from only a subset of devices (sample). [CLS] [SEP] by running the diagnostic
data viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is
part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. [CLS] [SEP]
instructions for how to download the diagnostic data viewer tool can be found
at **start > settings > privacy > diagnostics & feedback**. [CLS] [SEP]

specific data items collected in windows diagnostics are subject to change to
give microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes
described. [CLS] [SEP] for example, to ensure microsoft can troubleshoot the latest
performance issue impacting usersâ computing experience or update a windows
10 device that is new to the market, microsoft may need to collect data items
that were not collected previously. [CLS] [SEP] for a current list of data types collected
at **required diagnostic data** and **optional diagnostic data** , see
[windows required (basic level) diagnostic events and
fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/basic-level-windows-
diagnostic-events-and-fields-1903) or [windows 10 optional (full level)
diagnostic data](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-
diagnostic-data). [CLS] [SEP] we provide limited portions of error report information to
partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products
and services which work with windows and other microsoft product and services. [CLS] [SEP]
they are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those
products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share some aggregated, de-identified
diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for windows apps and features,
with selected third parties. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about diagnostic data in windows
10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=614828). [CLS] [SEP]

 **inking and typing recognition**. [CLS] [SEP] you also can choose to help microsoft
improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic
data. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to do so, microsoft will collect samples of the content
you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition,
autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many
languages used by windows customers. [CLS] [SEP] when microsoft collects inking and typing
diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove
unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email
addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original
content or associate the input to you. [CLS] [SEP] it also includes associated performance
data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added
to the dictionary. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about improving inking and typing in windows
10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=614828). [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to turn on **tailored experiences** , we will use your windows
diagnostic data (basic or full as you have selected) to offer you personalized
tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance microsoft experiences. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
selected basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on
information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it
is performing properly. [CLS] [SEP] if you have selected full, personalization is also
based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional
information about the health of your device. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do not use
information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech,
typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data
from customers who have selected full. [CLS] [SEP]

tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize
windows, as well as ads and recommendations for microsoft and third-party
products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your windows
experiences. [CLS] [SEP] for example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may
tell you about features you may not know about or that are new. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
having a problem with your windows device, you may be offered a solution. [CLS] [SEP] you
may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be
shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you donât. [CLS] [SEP] if
you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the
microsoft store that streams more efficiently. [CLS] [SEP] or, if you are running out of
space on your hard drive, windows may recommend you try onedrive or purchase
hardware to gain more space. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about tailored experiences in windows

summary

 **windows location service**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft operates a location service that
helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific windows device. [CLS] [SEP]
depending on the capabilities of the device, the deviceâs location can be
determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be
determined precisely. [CLS] [SEP] when you have enabled location on a windows device, or
you have given permission for microsoft apps to access location information on
non-windows devices, data about cell towers and wi-fi access points and their
locations is collected by microsoft and added to the location database after
removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was
collected. [CLS] [SEP] this de-identified copy of location information is used to improve
microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location
service provider partners, currently here (see https://www.here.com/), to
improve the location services of the provider. [CLS] [SEP]

windows services and features (such as browsers and cortana), apps running on
windows, and websites opened in windows browsers can access the deviceâs
location through windows if your settings allow them to do so. [CLS] [SEP] some features
and apps request location permission when you first install windows, some ask
the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the
deviceâs location. [CLS] [SEP] for information about certain windows apps that use the
deviceâs location, see the windows apps section of this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

when an app or feature accesses the deviceâs location and you are signed in
with a microsoft account, your windows device will also upload its location to
the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services
that use your microsoft account and for which youâve granted permission. [CLS] [SEP] we
will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the
previous one). [CLS] [SEP] data about a windows device's recent location history is also
stored on the device even if not using a microsoft account, and certain apps
and windows features can access this location history. [CLS] [SEP] you can clear your
device's location history at any time in the device's settings menu. [CLS] [SEP]

in settings, you can also view which apps have access to the deviceâs
precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to
the deviceâs location for particular apps, or turn off access to the
deviceâs location. [CLS] [SEP] you can also set a default location, which will be used
when the location service canât detect a more exact location for your
device. [CLS] [SEP]

even when youâve turned off access to the deviceâs location, some third-
party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as
bluetooth, wi-fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the deviceâs precise
location. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be
able to determine your deviceâs location when the deviceâs location
setting is off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007461). [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an
emergency call, windows will attempt to determine and share your precise
location, regardless of your location settings. [CLS] [SEP] if your device has a sim card
or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access
to your deviceâs location. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about location in windows
10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=529987). [CLS] [SEP]

 **general location**. [CLS] [SEP] if you turn on the general location feature, apps that
cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location,
such as your city, postal code, or region. [CLS] [SEP]

 **find my phone**. [CLS] [SEP] the find my phone feature allows you to find the location
of your windows phone from the [microsoft account
website](https://account.microsoft.com/), even if you have turned off all
access to the location service on the phone. [CLS] [SEP] if you have turned on the "save
my location every few hours" feature in the find my phone settings on your
phone, the find my phone feature will periodically send and store a single
last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location
services on your phone. [CLS] [SEP] each time a new location is sent, it replaces the
previously-stored location. [CLS] [SEP]

 **find my device**. [CLS] [SEP] the find my device feature allows an administrator of a
windows portable device to find the location of that device from
account.microsoft.com/devices. [CLS] [SEP] to enable find my device, an administrator
needs to be signed in with a microsoft account and have the location setting
enabled. [CLS] [SEP] this feature will work even if other users have denied access to
location for all their apps. [CLS] [SEP] when the administrator attempts to locate the
device, users will see a notification in the notification area. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more
about find my device in windows
10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=533063). [CLS] [SEP]

 **windows motion sensing**. [CLS] [SEP] windows devices with motion activity detection
can collect motion activity. [CLS] [SEP] this data can enable features such as a pedometer
to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate
how many calories you burn. [CLS] [SEP] this data and history is stored on your device and
can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that
data. [CLS] [SEP]

 **recording**. [CLS] [SEP] some windows devices have a recording feature that allows you
to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including
your communications with others. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to record a session, the
recording will be saved locally on your device. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, you may have
the option to transmit the recording to a microsoft product or service that
broadcasts the recording publicly. [CLS] [SEP] **important: you should understand your
legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. [CLS] [SEP]
this may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the
conversation or any other authorizations as required.** microsoft is not
responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings. [CLS] [SEP]

 **device encryption**. [CLS] [SEP] device encryption helps protect the data stored on
your device by encrypting it using bitlocker drive encryption technology. [CLS] [SEP] when
device encryption is on, windows automatically encrypts the drive windows is
installed on and generates a recovery key. [CLS] [SEP] the bitlocker recovery key for your
personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal microsoft
onedrive account. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any
purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

 **malicious software removal tool**. [CLS] [SEP] the malicious software removal tool
(msrt) runs on your device at least once per month as part of windows update. [CLS] [SEP]
msrt checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software
("malware") and helps remove any infections found. [CLS] [SEP] when the msrt runs, it will
remove the malware listed on the microsoft support website if the malware is
on your device. [CLS] [SEP] during a malware check, a report will be sent to microsoft
with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your
device. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want msrt to send this data to microsoft, you can
disable msrt's reporting component. [CLS] [SEP]

 **microsoft family**. [CLS] [SEP] parents can use microsoft family to understand and set
boundaries on how their child is using their device. [CLS] [SEP] there are many features
available to family members, so please carefully review the information
provided when you create or join a family. [CLS] [SEP] when family activity reporting is
turned on for a child, microsoft will collect details about how the child uses
their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. [CLS] [SEP]
activity reports are routinely deleted from microsoft servers after a short
period of time. [CLS] [SEP]

 **microsoft defender smartscreen**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft defender smartscreen helps
protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web
content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other
threats to you or your device. [CLS] [SEP] when checking a file, data about that file is
sent to microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the
download location, and the file's digital certificates. [CLS] [SEP] if microsoft defender
smartscreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see
a warning prior to opening the file. [CLS] [SEP] when checking web content, data about the
content and your device is sent to microsoft, including the full web address
of the content. [CLS] [SEP] if microsoft defender smartscreen detects that content is
potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft
defender smartscreen can be turned on or off in settings. [CLS] [SEP]

 **microsoft defender antivirus**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft defender antivirus looks for
malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other
malicious content on your device. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft defender antivirus is
automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware
software is actively protecting your device. [CLS] [SEP] if microsoft defender antivirus
is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. [CLS] [SEP] when
microsoft defender antivirus is turned on, or is running because limited
periodic scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to microsoft
that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software,
potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send
files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files
for further inspection. [CLS] [SEP] if a report is likely to contain personal data, the
report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. [CLS] [SEP]
you can configure microsoft defender antivirus not to send reports and
suspected malware to microsoft. [CLS] [SEP]

 **speech**. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature
and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use microsoftâs
cloud-based speech recognition technologies in cortana, the mixed reality
portal, dictation in windows, supported microsoft store apps, and over time in
other parts of windows. [CLS] [SEP]

turning on speech while setting up a hololens device or installing windows
mixed reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app
interactions. [CLS] [SEP] both device-based speech recognition and online speech
recognition settings will be enabled. [CLS] [SEP] with both settings enabled, while your
headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input
and will send your voice data to microsoftâs cloud-based speech recognition
technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

when you use microsoftâs cloud-based speech recognition technologies,
microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text
transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about how
microsoft manages your voice data, see speech recognition technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

you can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to
microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] however, microsoftâs cloud-based speech recognition technologies
provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition. [CLS] [SEP]
when the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that
donât rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognitionâlike the
narrator app or the windows speech recognition appâwill still work. [CLS] [SEP]

if youâve given permission in cortana, we also collect additional
information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the
names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts
including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use,
and information about your music preferences. [CLS] [SEP] this additional data enables us
to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate
commands, messages, or documents. [CLS] [SEP]

you can turn off online speech recognition at any time. [CLS] [SEP] this will stop your
voice data from being sent to microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using a hololens or mixed
reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] this will stop the device from listening for your voice input. [CLS] [SEP] [learn
more about speech recognition in windows

**voice activation**. [CLS] [SEP] windows provides supported apps with the ability to
respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that
appâfor example allowing cortana to listen and respond to âhey cortana.â

if youâve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, windows
10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords. [CLS] [SEP] once a
keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can
process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer. [CLS] [SEP]
the app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to
process the commands. [CLS] [SEP] each app should ask you for permission before accessing
voice recordings. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. [CLS] [SEP] if
enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice
keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who
speaks near the device. [CLS] [SEP] when the device is locked, the app will have access to
the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked. [CLS] [SEP]

you can turn off voice activation at any time. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about voice
activation in windows 10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874646). [CLS] [SEP]

this section applies to legacy versions of microsoft edge (versions 44 and
below). [CLS] [SEP] see the microsoft edge section of the privacy statement for
information about non-legacy versions of microsoft edge. [CLS] [SEP]

microsoft edge is the default web browser for windows. [CLS] [SEP] internet explorer, the
legacy browser from microsoft, is also available in windows. [CLS] [SEP] whenever you use
a web browser to access the internet, data about your device ("standard device
data") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. [CLS] [SEP] standard
device data includes your device's ip address, browser type and language,
access times, and referring website addresses. [CLS] [SEP] this data might be logged on
those websites' web servers. [CLS] [SEP] which data is logged and how that data is used
depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services
you use. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, microsoft edge sends a unique browser id to certain
websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser
features and services. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing
history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on
your device. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete this data from your device using delete browsing
history. [CLS] [SEP]

microsoft edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:

  *  **web note**. [CLS] [SEP] allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **active reading**. [CLS] [SEP] allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **hub**. [CLS] [SEP] allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **website pin to taskbar**. [CLS] [SEP] which allows you to pin your favorite websites to the windows taskbar. [CLS] [SEP] websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites. [CLS] [SEP]

some microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across
other devices when you sign in with your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, in
internet explorer, this information includes your browsing history and
favorites; and in microsoft edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists,
autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may
include data for extensions that you have installed. [CLS] [SEP] as an example, if you
sync your microsoft edge reading list across devices, copies of the content
you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for
later viewing. [CLS] [SEP] you can disable syncing in internet explorer by going to
**start** > **settings** > **accounts** > **sync your settings**. [CLS] [SEP] (for more
information, see the sync settings section of this privacy statement.) you can
also disable syncing of microsoft edge browser information by turning off the

summary

a number of microsoft apps are included with windows and others are available
in microsoft store. [CLS] [SEP] some of those apps include:

 **maps app**. [CLS] [SEP] the maps app provides location-based services and uses bing
services to process your searches within the maps app. [CLS] [SEP] when the maps app has
access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in
windows, when you use the â@â key to initiate a search in supported text

 **camera and photos apps**. [CLS] [SEP] both the camera and photos apps can utilize
location data. [CLS] [SEP] if you allow the camera app to use your location, location data
is embedded in the photos you take with your device. [CLS] [SEP] other descriptive data,
such as camera model and the date that the picture was taken, is also embedded
in photos and videos. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded
data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. [CLS] [SEP] you can
disable the camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to
the location service in your device's settings menu or turning off the camera
app's access to the location service. [CLS] [SEP] the photos app can group your photos and
videos by time and location when you import photos and videos that include
location data. [CLS] [SEP] to do so, the photos app sends location data in your photos and
videos to microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as "seattle,
washington". [CLS] [SEP]

the camera app enables face detection technology to optimize the device camera
settings, such as assisting with the automatic focus, white balance, and
exposure of photo captures. [CLS] [SEP] the camera app does not use identifiers to group
people or identify who the person is in a focal frame. [CLS] [SEP] the camera app does not
retain any face detection data. [CLS] [SEP]

the photos app presents different tabs to group photos and videos by time,
location, tags, and faces. [CLS] [SEP] the collection tab displays photos and videos
according to their time. [CLS] [SEP] the album tab helps users organize their photos and
videos by location and common tags. [CLS] [SEP] the people tab helps you organize your
photos and videos by grouping photos and videos with similar faces, which you
can then associate with contacts. [CLS] [SEP]

if you enable the people setting on the photos app's settings page, the app
will use both face detection and recognition technologies to organize your
photos and videos into groups. [CLS] [SEP] the grouping feature uses facial detection to
identify photos and videos containing faces and facial recognition to group
photos and videos associated with a given person. [CLS] [SEP] once grouped, you may
associate a facial grouping with a contact from your people app. [CLS] [SEP]

photos' facial groupings and associated data are only accessible to you within
the photos app. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft does not access or use this facial data for any
purpose outside the photos app. [CLS] [SEP] you, and not microsoft, are responsible for
ensuring you have appropriate permissions from the people in your photos and
videos to use facial grouping technology to group your photos and videos in
your personal albums. [CLS] [SEP]

your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you elect to keep
the groupings or the photos or videos. [CLS] [SEP] if the people setting is turned on, you
will be prompted to allow the photos app to continue to permit facial
groupings after three years of non-interaction with the photos app. [CLS] [SEP] at any
time, you can go to the settings page in the photos app to turn the people
setting on or off. [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about the photos app, facial recognition, and
grouping](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4468245/group-photos-by-faces)

 **people app**. [CLS] [SEP] the people app lets you see and interact with all your
contacts in one place. [CLS] [SEP] when you add an account to the people app, your
contacts from your account will be automatically added to the people app. [CLS] [SEP] you
can add other accounts to the people app, including your social networks (such
as facebook and twitter) and email accounts. [CLS] [SEP] when you add an account, we tell
you what data the people app can import or sync with the particular service
and let you choose what you want to add. [CLS] [SEP] other apps you install may also sync
data to the people app, including providing additional details to existing
contacts. [CLS] [SEP] when you view a contact in the people app, information about your
recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events,
including from apps that the people app syncs data from) will be retrieved and
displayed to you. [CLS] [SEP] you can remove an account from the people app at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

 **mail and calendar app**. [CLS] [SEP] the mail and calendar app allows you to connect
all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-
party email and file storage providers. [CLS] [SEP] the app provides location-based
services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable
the appâs use of your location. [CLS] [SEP] when you add an account to the mail and
calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings
from your account will automatically sync to your device and to microsoft
servers. [CLS] [SEP] at any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data
thatâs synced from your account. [CLS] [SEP] to configure an account, you must provide
the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which
will be sent over the internet to the third-party providerâs server. [CLS] [SEP] the app
will first attempt to use a secure (ssl) connection to configure your account
but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not
support ssl. [CLS] [SEP] if you add an account provided by an organization (such as a
company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement
certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the
ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of
the app. [CLS] [SEP]

 **messaging app**. [CLS] [SEP] when you sign in with a microsoft account on your device,
you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your sms and mms
messages and store them in your microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] this allows you to retrieve
the messages if you lose or change phones. [CLS] [SEP] after your initial device set-up,
you can manage your messaging settings at any time. [CLS] [SEP] turning off your sms/mms
backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your
microsoft account. [CLS] [SEP] to delete such messages, you must first delete them from
your device prior to turning off backup. [CLS] [SEP] if you allow the messaging app to use
your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing

summary

the xbox network is the online gaming and entertainment service from microsoft
that consists of software and online experiences across different platforms. [CLS] [SEP]
this service lets you find and play games, view content, and connect with
friends on xbox and other gaming and social networks. [CLS] [SEP] you can connect to the
xbox network using xbox consoles, windows 10 pcs, and mobile devices (android
and iphone). [CLS] [SEP]

when you sign up for an xbox online profile, we assign a gamertag (a public
nickname) and a unique id to identify you. [CLS] [SEP] when you sign in on xbox devices,
apps, and services, the data we collect about your use is stored using these
unique identifier(s). [CLS] [SEP]

xbox consoles are devices you can use to find and play games, movies, music,
and other digital entertainment. [CLS] [SEP] when you sign in to xbox experiencesâin
apps or on a consoleâwe also assign a unique device identifier. [CLS] [SEP] when your
xbox console is connected to the internet, for instance, and you sign in to
the console, we identify which console and which version of the consoleâs
operating system youâre using. [CLS] [SEP]

xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to
and backed by services such as xbox services and cloud gaming. [CLS] [SEP] to ensure these
connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as
expected, required service data may be collected whenever you use a connected

 **digital rights management**. [CLS] [SEP] silverlight uses microsoft digital rights
management (drm) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. [CLS] [SEP] if
you access drm-protected content (such as music or video) with silverlight, it
will request media usage rights from a rights server on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] in order
to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before
silverlight sends the request to the rights server. [CLS] [SEP] when requesting media
usage rights, silverlight will provide the rights server with an id for the
drm-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data
about the drm components on your device such as their revision and security
levels, and a unique identifier for your device. [CLS] [SEP]

 **drm updates**. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, accessing drm-protected content will require
an update to silverlight or to the drm components on your device. [CLS] [SEP] when you
attempt to play content that requires a drm update, silverlight will send a
request to a microsoft server containing basic data about your device,
including information about the drm components on your computer such as their
revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier
for your device. [CLS] [SEP] the microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique
drm update for your device, which will then be installed by silverlight. [CLS] [SEP] you
can turn off or configure drm component updates on the **playback** tab in the
silverlight configuration tool. [CLS] [SEP]
