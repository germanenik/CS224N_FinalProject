# our privacy manifesto

we believe the internet should do a simple thing: keep your private
information private. [CLS] [SEP] no one should be able to touch what you think or write
and do, but you. [CLS] [SEP] and we are out to prove that far too many companies mismanage
your information for no other reason than laziness and greed. [CLS] [SEP]

we will never ask you to take our word for protecting your privacy by burying
lax standards in user agreements carefully crafted so nobody understands them. [CLS] [SEP]
instead, we will proudly present peer review and auditable privacy policies
that the entire world can see, touch and debate. [CLS] [SEP]

here's how we do it:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **end to end privacy:** all your data — no matter if you’re using a pc, a phone, a tablet or a gaming system — is encrypted everywhere you _don't control._ on our servers. [CLS] [SEP] on our network. [CLS] [SEP] on a public network. [CLS] [SEP] in the cloud. [CLS] [SEP] on mars. [CLS] [SEP] whenever your information moves anywhere away from your direct control, it will be seriously encrypted with a passcode that no one else in the world knows but you. [CLS] [SEP] 

  2. [CLS] [SEP] **secure connections.** whenever we move your encrypted data over a network, in order to deliver services to you, it is sent over a strictly secure connection to only our private servers. [CLS] [SEP] because this data is encrypted, we can't read it, and we can’t sell it. [CLS] [SEP] even if someone forced their way into our data centers, your data would be complete gibberish to them. [CLS] [SEP] forever. [CLS] [SEP] 

  3. [CLS] [SEP] **open-source:** we've made all our code open-source, so it's clear how your data is being handled every step of the way. [CLS] [SEP] many companies promise encryption but don't open up their code for peer-review. [CLS] [SEP] we believe the definition of end-to-end encryption should mean that code on both ends is open-sourced. [CLS] [SEP] while trust in a closed system can be convenient at times, nothing is more trustable than mathematical certainty and utter transparency. [CLS] [SEP] 

  4. [CLS] [SEP] **no tracking or intrusive advertising.** we are heavily opposed to industry standard tracking tools like google analytics, which gathers and analyzes your browsing history to sell you better advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] instead, we use an open-source, privacy-focused, and self-hosted matomo analytics installation. [CLS] [SEP] 

  5. [CLS] [SEP] **respectful analytics.** we are utterly and completely transparent about reporting exactly what we track, and why. [CLS] [SEP] we announce when we update those policies. [CLS] [SEP] and we confirm with you that you are comfortable with those changes. [CLS] [SEP] to date, our applications, including web, desktop, and mobile, contain no analytics or tracking software whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]
