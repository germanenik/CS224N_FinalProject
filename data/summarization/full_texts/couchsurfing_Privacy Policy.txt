# couchsurfing.com privacy policy

effective date: **june 30, 2020**

please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how
we collect, use, disclose, protect and otherwise handle information about you. [CLS] [SEP]
by using couchsurfing services, you consent to the collection and use of your
data as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### this privacy policy describes:

  * the information we, couchsurfing international, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“couchsurfing”) collect about you,
  * how we use and share that information, and
  * the privacy choices available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy applies to information we collect when you use our
websites, mobile applications and other online products and services
(collectively, the “services”), or when you otherwise interact with us. [CLS] [SEP]

from time to time, we may change the provisions of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we
encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly to stay informed about
our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

### what information do we collect when you use our services?

### information you provide to us

we collect information you provide to us, such as when you create an account,
update your profile, use the interactive features of our services, participate
in contests, promotions or surveys, request customer support or otherwise
communicate with us. [CLS] [SEP] the types of information we may collect include:

  * basic user information, such as your name, username, gender, birth date, email address, mailing address, billing address, phone number and photographs;
  * messages and interactive forum information, such as discussion group posts, messages to other couchsurfing users and information you provide in connection with activities and events;
  * other background, contact and demographic information, such as your occupation, personal url, im username, emergency contact, home descriptions, travel history and plans and other interests and self-descriptions you choose to provide;
  * information stored on your mobile device, such as your photos, calendar information and contacts, if you have given us permission to access this information; and
  * information about you from other couchsurfing users, such as trust ratings, friend connections, public references, and other interconnections and interactions between you and other couchsurfing users. [CLS] [SEP]
  * information provided to us by you as a part of the identity verification process. [CLS] [SEP] this includes the identity document and images used in the process, as well as the information included on the identity document provided. [CLS] [SEP]

### information we collect automatically

when you access or use our services, we may also automatically collect
information about you, including:

  * location information: we may collect information about your location when you access our mobile application or website, or otherwise consent to the collection of this information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * device information: we collect device-specific information when you access our services, including your hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information and information about the device’s interaction with our services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * log information: we collect log information about how you access or use our services, including your access times, browser type and language, internet service provider and internet protocol (“ip”) address. [CLS] [SEP]
  * information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies: we may automatically collect information using cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking gifs,” “pixel tags” and “tracking pixels”) and other tracking technologies to, among other things, improve our services and your experience, monitor user activity, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. [CLS] [SEP]

### information we collect from other sources

we may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with
information we collect through our services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you create or log
into your couchsurfing account through a third-party social networking site,
we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name,
profile picture, connections and other account information in accordance with
the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking
site. [CLS] [SEP]

some of this information may be shared with other users. [CLS] [SEP] for example, they may
be able to see your connections who are also couchsurfing users. [CLS] [SEP]

### how do we use this information?

we use information about you for purposes described in this privacy policy or
otherwise disclosed to you on or in connection with our services. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
we may use information about you to:

  * operate and improve our services;
  * protect the safety of couchsurfing users and provide our verification service;
  * send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
  * respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;
  * communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide other news and information about couchsurfing and other third parties;
  * monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our services;
  * personalize the services, which may include providing content or features that match user profiles or interests;
  * process and deliver contest entries and rewards; and
  * link or combine with other information we get from third parties to help understand your needs and provide you with better service. [CLS] [SEP]

we retain the personal data you provide until your account is deleted. [CLS] [SEP] account
deactivation does not delete your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases we may retain
certain information in anonymized or aggregated form. [CLS] [SEP]

### transfers of your personal information abroad

couchsurfing may store and process personal information in the united states
and other countries, where under local laws you may have fewer legal rights. [CLS] [SEP]
however, wherever we store your information we will treat it in accordance
with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] couchsurfing international inc. [CLS] [SEP] complies with the
eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework and the swiss – u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework
as set forth by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] department of commerce regarding the collection, use,
and retention of personal information transferred from the european union,
united kingdom and switzerland to the united states, respectively. [CLS] [SEP]
couchsurfing international inc. [CLS] [SEP] has certified to the department of commerce
that it adheres to the privacy shield principles. [CLS] [SEP] if there is any conflict
between the terms in this privacy policy and the privacy shield principles,
the privacy shield principles shall govern. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more about the privacy
shield program, and to view our certification, please visit
<https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. [CLS] [SEP]

### sharing of information

we will not share information about you with outside parties except as
described below or elsewhere in this privacy policy:

  * with your consent
  * with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us; this includes [onfido](http://www.onfido.com/), the provider of our identity verification product, as well as other third party vendors who assist us with fraud prevention and detection. [CLS] [SEP]
  * with others who access or use our services in accordance with the privacy settings you establish 
  * with search engines in order to index the content you provide as part of a discussion forum or public profile;
  * with partners who run contests, special offers or other events or activities in connection with our services;
  * in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company;
  * if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; and
  * to enforce our agreements, policies, and [terms of use](/about/terms-of-use) to protect the security or integrity of our services; or to protect couchsurfing, our users or the public from harm or illegal activities. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot
reasonably be used to identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

couchsurfing is responsible and liable if third-party agents that it uses to
process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with
the privacy shield principles, unless couchsurfing proves that it is not
responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur. [CLS] [SEP]

### social media tools

couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which
let you share actions you take on our services with other media, and vice
versa. [CLS] [SEP] the use of such features enables the sharing of certain information
with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with
the third party that provides the social sharing feature. [CLS] [SEP] for more information
about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection
with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third
parties that provide these social sharing features. [CLS] [SEP] couchsurfing may also
allow you to access google maps. [CLS] [SEP] please note that when you use google maps,
you are subject to [google’s privacy
policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/), as amended by
google from time to time. [CLS] [SEP]

### third party links

occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products
or services as part of our services. [CLS] [SEP] these third parties may have separate and
independent privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] we therefore have no responsibility or liability
for the activities of these third parties and how they collect, use or share
information about you. [CLS] [SEP] nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our
services and welcome any feedback about these third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

### advertising and analytics services provided by others

we may allow third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the
internet and to provide analytics services in relation to the use of our
services. [CLS] [SEP] these entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies
to collect information about your use of the services and other websites,
including your ip address and information about your web browser and operating
system, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion
information. [CLS] [SEP] this information may be used by couchsurfing and others to, among
other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our
services and other websites and better understand your online activity. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that we may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal
information in a hashed, non-human readable form, with these third parties. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, we may engage a third party data provider who may collect web log
data from you or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable
you to receive customized ads or content. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies may reflect de-
identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily
provide to us (e.g., an email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form. [CLS] [SEP]
