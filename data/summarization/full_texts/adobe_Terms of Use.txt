1.3 **business users.** if you received an “ **entitlement** ” (which is
defined as the right to use, access, and consume the software and services)
from an organization or group, including but not limited to a business or any
other commercial entity, government entity, non-profit organization, or
educational institution (each, a “ **business** ”) under one of adobe’s
business plans (such as creative cloud for teams, creative cloud for
enterprise, or document cloud), then (a) you are a “ **business user** ” of
such business; (b) your adobe profile associated with such entitlement is a “
**business profile** ”; and (c) all references to “ **you** ” in these terms
will mean such business. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a business user, you agree that, due to
your receipt of entitlements from such business, (1) adobe may provide such
business with the ability to access, use, remove, retain, and control your
business profile and all content therein whether uploaded or imported before
or after the date these terms were last updated; (2) your use of the services
and software is governed by such business’s agreement with adobe; and (3)
adobe may provide your personal information to such business. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a
business user with entitlements from multiple businesses, you may have
separate business profiles associated with each business. [CLS] [SEP] as a business user,
you may have different agreements with or obligations to a business, which may
affect your business profile or your content. [CLS] [SEP] adobe is not responsible for any
violation by you of such agreements or obligations. [CLS] [SEP] if you did not receive
entitlements from a business (e.g., you purchased a creative cloud for
individuals plan and received entitlements through this plan), then (a) you
are a “ **personal user** ”; (b) your adobe profile is a personal profile; (c)
you maintain sole access and control over all content in your personal account
or personal profile (except as otherwise indicated in the privacy policy); and
(d) all references to “ **you** ” in these general terms will mean you as an
individual. [CLS] [SEP] if you received entitlements through a personal plan and from a
business, then you are both a personal user and a business user. [CLS] [SEP] you are a
personal user when you utilize the entitlements you obtained through your
personal plan, and you are a business user when you utilize your entitlements
provided by a business. [CLS] [SEP]  

1.4 **business email domains.** as a personal user or a business user, you may
create an adobe account using an email address provided or assigned to you by
a business (such as your work email address). [CLS] [SEP] if the business establishes a
direct relationship with us, they may want to add your account to such
relationship. [CLS] [SEP] if this happens, the business may, with prior notice, roll your
account into the business’s account. [CLS] [SEP] this means the business may (a) access
the account; (b) take control over the account and any content therein whether
stored, uploaded, or imported before or after the date these terms were last
updated; and (c) recommend any non-business content associated with such
account to be moved to a new account that utilizes an email address not
associated with such business. [CLS] [SEP] you, as an individual or a business user, also
acknowledge that adobe may provide your personal information to such business,
such as your name or email address. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want a business to access,
use, remove, retain, or control an account or profile, then do not use a
business email address with that account. [CLS] [SEP] information regarding how you may
change the email address associated with your account may be found
[here](http://www.adobe.com/go/tou-update-helpx). [CLS] [SEP]

terms is not a waiver of that provision. [CLS] [SEP]

18.9 **force majeure.** neither party will be liable to the other for any
delay or failure to perform any obligation (other than your payment
obligations to adobe) under the terms if the delay or failure is due to
unforeseen events, which occur after the effectiveness of the terms and which
are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockade,
war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government
or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays
the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able
to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost. [CLS] [SEP]
