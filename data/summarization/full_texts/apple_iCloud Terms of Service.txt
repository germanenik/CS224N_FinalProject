# welcome to icloud

    

    

this legal agreement between you and apple governs your use of the icloud
product, software, services, and websites (collectively referred to as the
“service”). [CLS] [SEP] it is important that you read and understand the following terms. [CLS] [SEP]
by clicking “agree,” you are agreeing that these terms will apply if you
choose to access or use the service. [CLS] [SEP]

apple is the provider of the service, which permits you to utilize certain
internet services, including storing your personal content (such as contacts,
calendars, photos, notes, reminders, documents, app data, and icloud email)
and making it accessible on your compatible devices and computers, and certain
location based services, only under the terms and conditions set forth in this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] icloud is automatically enabled when you are running devices on ios
9 or later and sign in with your apple id during device setup, unless you are
upgrading the device and have previously chosen not to enable icloud. [CLS] [SEP] you can
disable icloud in settings. [CLS] [SEP] when icloud is enabled, your content will be
automatically sent to and stored by apple, so you can later access that
content or have content wirelessly pushed to your other icloud-enabled devices
or computers. [CLS] [SEP]

**i. [CLS] [SEP] requirements for use of the service**

 **a. [CLS] [SEP] age.** the service is only available to individuals aged 13 years or
older (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction), unless you are
under 13 years old and your apple id was provided to you as a result of a
request by an approved educational institution or established as part of the
family sharing feature by your parent or guardian. [CLS] [SEP] we do not knowingly
collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or
equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable
parental consent. [CLS] [SEP] parents and guardians should also remind any minors that
conversing with strangers on the internet can be dangerous and take
appropriate precautions to protect children, including monitoring their use of
the service. [CLS] [SEP]

to use the service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the service
under the laws of the united states or other applicable jurisdictions,
including the country in which you reside or from where you use the service. [CLS] [SEP]
by accepting this agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to
the foregoing. [CLS] [SEP]

 **b. [CLS] [SEP] devices and accounts.** use of the service may require compatible
devices, internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require
periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. [CLS] [SEP]
apple reserves the right to limit the number of accounts that may be created
from a device and the number of devices associated with an account. [CLS] [SEP] the latest
version of required software may be required for certain transactions or
features. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that meeting these requirements is your responsibility. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] limitations on use.** you agree to use the service only for purposes
permitted by this agreement, and only to the extent permitted by any
applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] your account is allocated 5gb of storage capacity as described
in the icloud feature pages. [CLS] [SEP] additional storage is available for purchase, as
described below. [CLS] [SEP] exceeding any applicable or reasonable limitation of
bandwidth, or storage capacity (for example, backup or email account space) is
prohibited and may prevent you from backing up to icloud, adding documents, or
receiving new email sent to your icloud email address. [CLS] [SEP] if your use of the
service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens apple’s
ability to provide the service or other systems, apple shall be entitled to
take all reasonable steps to protect the service and apple’s systems, which
may include suspension of your access to the service. [CLS] [SEP] repeated violations of
the limitations may result in termination of your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a covered entity, business associate or representative of a covered
entity or business associate (as those terms are defined at 45 c.f.r §
160.103), you agree that you will not use any component, function or other
facility of icloud to create, receive, maintain or transmit any “protected
health information” (as such term is defined at 45 c.f.r § 160.103) or use
icloud in any manner that would make apple (or any apple subsidiary) your or
any third party’s business associate. [CLS] [SEP]

 **d. [CLS] [SEP] availability of the service.** the service, or any feature or part
thereof, may not be available in all languages or in all countries and apple
makes no representation that the service, or any feature or part thereof, is
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent you
choose to access and use the service, you do so at your own initiative and are
responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

 **e. [CLS] [SEP] changing the service.** apple reserves the right at any time to modify
this agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use
of the service, provided that apple will give you 30 days’ advance notice of
any material adverse change to the service or applicable terms of service,
unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from
legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user
privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to
other users; or due to a natural disaster, catastrophic event, war, or other
similar occurrence outside of apple’s reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to paid
cloud storage services, apple will not make any material adverse change to the
service before the end of your current paid term, unless a change is
reasonably necessary to address legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to
address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid
service disruptions to other users; or to avoid issues resulting from a
natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence
outside of apple’s reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that apple does make
material adverse changes to the service or terms of use, you will have the
right to terminate this agreement and your account, in which case apple will
provide you with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment for your then-current
paid term. [CLS] [SEP] apple shall not be liable to you for any modifications to the
service or terms of service made in accordance with this section ie. [CLS] [SEP]

 **ii. [CLS] [SEP] features and services**

 **a. [CLS] [SEP] use of location-based services**

apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services
that rely upon device-based location information using gps (or similar
technology, where available) and crowdsourced wi-fi access points and cell
tower locations. [CLS] [SEP] to provide such features or services, where available, apple
and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and
maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic
location of your device and information related to your icloud account
(“account”) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited
to your apple id, device id and name, and device type. [CLS] [SEP]

you may withdraw consent to apple and its partners’ and licensors’ collection,
use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and account data at
any time by not using the location-based features and turning off find my
(including the predecessor apps find my iphone and find my friends,
collectively referred to as “find my”), or location services in settings (as
applicable) on your device. [CLS] [SEP] when using third party services that use or
provide location data as part of the service, you are subject to and should
review such third party’s terms and privacy policy on use of location data by
such third party services. [CLS] [SEP] any location data provided by the service is not
intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is
needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location
data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. [CLS] [SEP]
apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the service, but
neither apple nor any of its service and/or content providers guarantees the
availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location
data or any other data displayed by the service. [CLS] [SEP] _location-based services are
not intended or suitable for use as an emergency locator system._

 **b. [CLS] [SEP] find my**

when you enable icloud and location services on a device running ios 13, ipad
os or macos catalina or later, find my (find my iphone for devices running ios
8 through ios 12) will be enabled automatically on that device and any apple
accessories paired with it. [CLS] [SEP] once enabled, your device will be automatically
linked to your apple id and your apple id password will be required before
anyone (including you) can turn off find my, sign out of icloud, erase or
activate the device. [CLS] [SEP] apple and its authorized agents may not perform hardware
or software support services, including services under apple’s limited
warranty, unless you disable find my prior to service. [CLS] [SEP] apple shall bear no
responsibility for your failure to protect your ios device with a passcode,
enable lost mode, and/or receive or respond to notices and communications. [CLS] [SEP]
apple shall also bear no responsibility for returning your ios device to you
or for any loss of data on your ios device. [CLS] [SEP]

offline finding is a crowdsourcing feature that can help you and others locate
missing devices when those devices are not connected to the internet. [CLS] [SEP] if
offline finding is enabled on a device, it can detect the presence of nearby
offline devices via bluetooth (or similar technologies). [CLS] [SEP] if a device detects a
missing offline device, it will use wi-fi or cellular connections to securely
report the approximate location of the device back to the apple id associated
with the device so the owner can view its location in the find my app. [CLS] [SEP]
location reporting is end-to-end encrypted, and apple cannot see the location
of the reporting device or any offline device. [CLS] [SEP] you can disable offline finding
in settings. [CLS] [SEP]

 **c. [CLS] [SEP] backup**

icloud backup periodically creates automatic backups for ios devices, when the
device is screen locked, connected to a power source, and connected to the
internet via a wi-fi network. [CLS] [SEP] if a device has not backed up to icloud for a
period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, apple reserves the right to
delete any backups associated with that device. [CLS] [SEP] backup may include device
settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, documents, your messages,
ringtones, health app data and other app data. [CLS] [SEP] for additional information,
please go to <https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht207428>. [CLS] [SEP] the following content
is not included in your icloud backup: content purchased from the itunes
store, app store, or apple books, media synced from your computer, and your
photo library if you have enabled icloud photo library. [CLS] [SEP] apple shall use
reasonable skill and due care in providing the service, but, _to the greatest
extent permissible by applicable law, apple does not guarantee or warrant that
any content you may store or access through the service will not be subject to
inadvertent damage, corruption, loss, or removal in accordance with the terms
of this agreement, and apple shall not be responsible should such damage,

provides to you in order to receive any such support. [CLS] [SEP] apple reserves the right

made by apple in its sole discretion and apple will not be responsible to you

to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to
avoid service disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, a
catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of apple’s
reasonable control. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of such termination, apple will provide you
with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment for your then-current paid term. [CLS] [SEP]
