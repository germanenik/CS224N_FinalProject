[CLS] [SEP] "the user," "you," and "your" refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the website or service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. [CLS] [SEP] a user must be at least 13 years of age. [CLS] [SEP] special terms may apply for business or government accounts (see section b(5): additional terms). [CLS] [SEP]
  8. [CLS] [SEP] the "website" refers to github's website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by github at or through the website. [CLS] [SEP] it also refers to github-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). [CLS] [SEP] these terms also govern github's conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [atom.io](https://atom.io/). [CLS] [SEP] occasionally, websites owned by github may provide different or additional terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] if those additional terms conflict with this agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. [CLS] [SEP]

### b. [CLS] [SEP] account terms

**short version:** _user accounts and organizations have different
administrative controls; a human must create your account; you must be 13 or
over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than
one free account. [CLS] [SEP] you alone are responsible for your account and anything that
happens while you are signed in to or using your account. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible
for keeping your account secure._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] account controls

  * users. [CLS] [SEP] subject to these terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your user account and the content within it. [CLS] [SEP]

  * organizations. [CLS] [SEP] the "owner" of an organization that was created under these terms has ultimate administrative control over that organization and the content within it. [CLS] [SEP] within the service, an owner can manage user access to the organization's data and projects. [CLS] [SEP] an organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one user account designated as an owner of an organization. [CLS] [SEP] if you are the owner of an organization under these terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that organization. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] required information

you must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup
process. [CLS] [SEP] any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional,
unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which
case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid
account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] account requirements

we have a few simple rules for user accounts on github's service. [CLS] [SEP]

  * you must be a human to create an account. [CLS] [SEP] accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. [CLS] [SEP] we do permit machine accounts:
  * a machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. [CLS] [SEP] a machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. [CLS] [SEP] multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. [CLS] [SEP] you may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free user account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * one person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must be age 13 or older. [CLS] [SEP] while we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with united states law. [CLS] [SEP] github does not target our service to children under 13, and we do not permit any users under 13 on our service. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn of any user under the age of 13, we will terminate that user's account immediately. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a resident of a country outside the united states, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your login may only be used by one person -- i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. [CLS] [SEP] a paid organization may only provide access to as many user accounts as your subscription allows. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may not use github in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the united states or any other applicable jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use github if you are or are working on behalf of a [specially designated national (sdn)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list/pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government agency. [CLS] [SEP] github may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain github services pursuant to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government authorizations. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please see our [export controls policy](/en/articles/github-and-export-controls). [CLS] [SEP] 

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] user account security

you are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our service. [CLS] [SEP]
we offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your
account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

  * you are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account). [CLS] [SEP]
  * you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. [CLS] [SEP] github cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you will promptly [notify github](https://support.github.com/contact) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] additional terms

in some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of github. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, you may be a member of an organization on github with its own terms
or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with
github; or you may use github to authenticate to another service. [CLS] [SEP] please be
aware that while these terms are our full agreement with you, other parties'
terms govern their relationships with you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a government user or otherwise accessing or using any github
service in a government capacity, this [government amendment to github terms
of service](/en/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-
s-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have signed up for github enterprise cloud, the [enterprise cloud
addendum](/en/articles/github-enterprise-cloud-addendum) applies to you, and
you agree to its provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

### c. [CLS] [SEP] acceptable use

**short version:** _github hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from
all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able
to work together in good faith. [CLS] [SEP] while using the service, you must follow the
terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can
post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. [CLS] [SEP] in short, be excellent to
each other._

your use of the website and service must not violate any applicable laws,
including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or
other laws in your jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for making sure that your
use of the service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [acceptable
use policies](/en/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [community
guidelines](/en/articles/github-community-guidelines). [CLS] [SEP]

### d. [CLS] [SEP] user-generated content

**short version:** _you own content you create, but you allow us certain
rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. [CLS] [SEP] you still
have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you
grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. [CLS] [SEP] we have the
right to remove content or close accounts if we need to._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] responsibility for user-generated content

you may create or upload user-generated content while using the service. [CLS] [SEP] you
are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from,
any user-generated content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make
available via the service, regardless of the form of that content. [CLS] [SEP] we are not
responsible for any public display or misuse of your user-generated content. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] github may remove content

we have the right to refuse or remove any user-generated content that, in our
sole discretion, violates any laws or [github terms or
policies](/en/github/site-policy). [CLS] [SEP] user-generated content displayed on github
for mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] ownership of content, right to post, and license grants

you retain ownership of and responsibility for your content. [CLS] [SEP] if you're posting
anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree
that you are responsible for any content you post; that you will only submit
content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with
any third party licenses relating to content you post. [CLS] [SEP]

because you retain ownership of and responsibility for your content, we need
you to grant us -- and other github users -- certain legal permissions, listed
in sections d.4 -- d.7. [CLS] [SEP] these license grants apply to your content. [CLS] [SEP] if you
upload content that already comes with a license granting github the
permissions we need to run our service, no additional license is required. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted
in sections d.4 -- d.7. [CLS] [SEP] the licenses you grant to us will end when you remove
your content from our servers, unless other users have forked it. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] license grant to us

we need the legal right to do things like host your content, publish it, and
share it. [CLS] [SEP] you grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive,
parse, and display your content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to
provide the service, including improving the service over time. [CLS] [SEP] this license
includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups;
show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise
analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case
your content is something like music or video. [CLS] [SEP]

this license does not grant github the right to sell your content. [CLS] [SEP] it also
does not grant github the right to otherwise distribute or use your content
outside of our provision of the service, except that as part of the right to
archive your content, github may permit our partners to store and archive your
content in public repositories in connection with the [github arctic code
vault and github archive program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] license grant to other users

any user-generated content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and
contributions to other users' repositories, may be viewed by others. [CLS] [SEP] by
setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to
view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own
copies of content from your repositories in repositories they control). [CLS] [SEP]

if you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each
user of github a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform
your content through the github service and to reproduce your content solely
on github as permitted through github's functionality (for example, through
forking). [CLS] [SEP] you may grant further rights if you [adopt a
license](/en/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-
source-license-in-your-repository). [CLS] [SEP] if you are uploading content you did not
create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the content you upload is
licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other github users. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] contributions under repository license

whenever you add content to a repository containing notice of a license, you
license that content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the
right to license that content under those terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a separate
agreement to license that content under different terms, such as a contributor
license agreement, that agreement will supersede. [CLS] [SEP]

isn't this just how it works already? yep. [CLS] [SEP] this is widely accepted as the norm
in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand
"inbound=outbound". [CLS] [SEP] we're just making it explicit. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] moral rights

you retain all moral rights to your content that you upload, publish, or
submit to any part of the service, including the rights of integrity and
attribution. [CLS] [SEP] however, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them
against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in section
d.4, but not otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant
github the rights we need to use your content without attribution and to make
reasonable adaptations of your content as necessary to render the website and
provide the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### e. [CLS] [SEP] private repositories

**short version:** _we treat the content of private repositories as
confidential, and we only access it as described in our privacy statement
--for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter,
to maintain the integrity of the service, to comply with our legal
obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the
law, or with your consent._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] control of private repositories

some accounts may have private repositories, which allow the user to control
access to content. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] confidentiality of private repositories

github considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to
you. [CLS] [SEP] github will protect the contents of private repositories from
unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use
to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no
event with less than a reasonable degree of care. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] access

github personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in
the situations described in our [privacy statement](/en/github/site-
policy/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents). [CLS] [SEP]

you may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. [CLS] [SEP] for
example:

  * you may enable various github services or features that require additional rights to your content in private repositories. [CLS] [SEP] these rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but github will continue to treat your private repository content as confidential. [CLS] [SEP] if those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the github service, we will provide an explanation of those rights. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/github/site-policy/github-
privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your
private repositories. [CLS] [SEP]

github will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content,
unless [for legal disclosure](/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-
statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or
where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if
in response to a security threat or other risk to security. [CLS] [SEP]

### f. [CLS] [SEP] copyright infringement and dmca policy

if you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please
contact us in accordance with our [digital millennium copyright act
policy](/en/articles/dmca-takedown-policy). [CLS] [SEP] if you are a copyright owner and
you believe that content on github violates your rights, please contact us via
[our convenient dmca form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing
copyright@github.com. [CLS] [SEP] there may be legal consequences for sending a false or
frivolous takedown notice. [CLS] [SEP] before sending a takedown request, you must
consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. [CLS] [SEP]

we will terminate the accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/articles/dmca-
takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### g. [CLS] [SEP] intellectual property notice

**short version:** _we own the service and all of our content. [CLS] [SEP] in order for
you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use
our content in the way we have allowed._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] github's rights to content

github and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain
ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the
website and service. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to
you under this agreement or by law. [CLS] [SEP] the look and feel of the website and
service is copyright (c) github, inc. [CLS] [SEP] all rights reserved. [CLS] [SEP] you may not
duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the html/css, javascript, or visual
design elements or concepts without express written permission from github. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] github trademarks and logos

if you'd like to use github's trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark
guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] license to github policies

this agreement is licensed under this [creative commons zero
license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). [CLS] [SEP] for details, see
our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license). [CLS] [SEP]

### h. [CLS] [SEP] api terms

**short version:** _you agree to these terms of service, plus this section h,
when using any of github 's apis (application provider interface), including
use of the api through a third party product that accesses github._

abuse or excessively frequent requests to github via the api may result in the
temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the api. [CLS] [SEP] github,
in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the api. [CLS] [SEP] we
will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not share api tokens to exceed github's rate limitations. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not use the api to download data or content from github for spamming
purposes, including for the purposes of selling github users' personal
information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. [CLS] [SEP]

all use of the github api is subject to these terms of service and the [github
privacy statement](https://github.com/site/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

github may offer subscription-based access to our api for those users who
require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of
github's service. [CLS] [SEP]

### i. [CLS] [SEP] github additional product terms

**short version:** _you need to follow certain specific terms and conditions
for github 's various features and products, and you agree to the supplemental
terms and conditions when you agree to this agreement._

some service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that
feature or product as set forth in the github additional product terms. [CLS] [SEP] by
accessing or using the services, you also agree to the [github additional
product terms](/en/github/site-policy/github-additional-product-terms). [CLS] [SEP]

### j. [CLS] [SEP] beta previews

**short version:** _beta previews may not be supported or may change at any
time, you may receive confidential information through those programs that
must remain confidential while the program is private, and we 'd love your
feedback to make our beta previews better._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] subject to change

beta previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, beta previews are not subject to the same security
measures and auditing to which the service has been and is subject. [CLS] [SEP] **by using
a beta preview, you use it at your own risk.**

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] confidentiality

as a user of beta previews, you may get access to special information that
isn't available to the rest of the world. [CLS] [SEP] due to the sensitive nature of this
information, it's important for us to make sure that you keep that information
secret. [CLS] [SEP]

**confidentiality obligations.** you agree that any non-public beta preview
information we give you, such as information about a private beta preview,
will be considered github's confidential information (collectively,
"confidential information"), regardless of whether it is marked or identified
as such. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to only use such confidential information for the express
purpose of testing and evaluating the beta preview (the "purpose"), and not
for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you should use the same degree of care as you would
with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable
precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or
dissemination of our confidential information. [CLS] [SEP] you promise not to disclose,
publish, or disseminate any confidential information to any third party,
unless we don't otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example,
you might be part of a github-organized group discussion about a private beta
preview feature). [CLS] [SEP]

**exceptions.** confidential information will not include information that is:
(a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this agreement through no
act or inaction on your part (such as when a private beta preview becomes a
public beta preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c)
independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality
obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from
github. [CLS] [SEP] you will not violate the terms of this agreement if you are required
to disclose confidential information pursuant to operation of law, provided
github has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless
prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] feedback

we're always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as
a beta preview user will help us do that. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to give us any ideas,
know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests,
recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services
(collectively, "feedback"), you acknowledge and agree that github will have a
royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable,
irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially
exploit and/or incorporate the feedback into our products, services, and
documentation. [CLS] [SEP]

### k. [CLS] [SEP] payment

**short version:** _you are responsible for any fees associated with your use
of github. [CLS] [SEP] we are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and
accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] pricing

our pricing and payment terms are available at
[github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). [CLS] [SEP] if you agree to a
subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the
payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment
term. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] upgrades, downgrades, and changes

  * we will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, github will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to content, features, or capacity of your account. [CLS] [SEP] please see our section on cancellation for information on getting a copy of that content. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] billing schedule; no refunds

**payment based on plan** for monthly or yearly payment plans, the service is
billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-
refundable. [CLS] [SEP] there will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service,
downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account; however,
the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. [CLS] [SEP] in
order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. [CLS] [SEP]

**payment based on usage** some service features are billed based on your
usage. [CLS] [SEP] a limited quantity of these service features may be included in your
plan for a limited term without additional charge. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to purchase
paid service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for
those service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. [CLS] [SEP]
monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in
arrears. [CLS] [SEP] see [github additional product terms for details](/en/github/site-
policy/github-additional-product-terms). [CLS] [SEP]

**invoicing** for invoiced users, user agrees to pay the fees in full, up
front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP] user must pay
the fees within thirty (30) days of the github invoice date. [CLS] [SEP] amounts payable
under this agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if user fails to pay any fees on time, github reserves the right,
in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge
interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate
allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and
(ii) terminate the applicable order form. [CLS] [SEP] user is solely responsible for all
taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on
github's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] authorization

by agreeing to these terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-
file credit card, paypal account, or other approved methods of payment for
fees that you authorize for github. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] responsibility for payment

you are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of
the service. [CLS] [SEP] by using the service, you agree to pay github any charge incurred
in connection with your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you dispute the matter, contact
[github support](https://support.github.com/contact). [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for
providing us with a valid means of payment for paid accounts. [CLS] [SEP] free accounts
are not required to provide payment information. [CLS] [SEP]

### l. [CLS] [SEP] cancellation and termination

**short version:** _you may close your account at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if you do, we 'll
treat your information responsibly._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] account cancellation

it is your responsibility to properly cancel your account with github. [CLS] [SEP] you can
[cancel your account at any time](/en/articles/how-do-i-cancel-my-account) by
going into your settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the
screen. [CLS] [SEP] the account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation
link. [CLS] [SEP] we are not able to cancel accounts in response to an email or phone
request. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] upon cancellation

we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal
requirements, we will delete your full profile and the content of your
repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some
information may remain in encrypted backups). [CLS] [SEP] this information can not be
recovered once your account is cancelled. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not delete content that you have contributed to other users'
repositories or that other users have forked. [CLS] [SEP]

upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an account owner
with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing account contents after account
cancellation, termination, or downgrade. [CLS] [SEP] you must make this request within 90
days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] github may terminate

github has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of
the website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice,
effective immediately. [CLS] [SEP] github reserves the right to refuse service to anyone
for any reason at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] survival

all provisions of this agreement which, by their nature, should survive
termination _will_ survive termination -- including, without limitation:
ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of
liability. [CLS] [SEP]

### m. [CLS] [SEP] communications with github

**short version:** _we use email and other electronic means to stay in touch
with our users._

#### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] electronic communication required

for contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in
an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the
service; and (2) agree that all terms of service, agreements, notices,
disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically
satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they
were on paper. [CLS] [SEP] this section does not affect your non-waivable rights. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] legal notice to github must be in writing

communications made through email or github support's messaging system will
not constitute legal notice to github or any of its officers, employees,
agents or representatives in any situation where notice to github is required
by contract or any law or regulation. [CLS] [SEP] legal notice to github must be in
writing and [served on github's legal agent](/en/articles/guidelines-for-
legal-requests-of-user-data/#submitting-requests). [CLS] [SEP]

**short version:** _we will not be liable for damages or losses arising from
your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this

you._

you understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party

you every time we fix a typo. [CLS] [SEP] so while we may modify this agreement at any
time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust
to them._

at any time and will update these terms of service in the event of any such
amendments. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify our users of material changes to this agreement,
