miraheze is committed to preserving your privacy and being transparent about
how we use information collected through miraheze.org (the "website") and any
other applications, functionality, or services offered by miraheze
(collectively with the website, the "services"). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy describes
how miraheze uses, collects, and shares information collected through the
services. [CLS] [SEP] by using the services, you agree to and accept the practices
described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we may modify this privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] we will post changes on
this page so be sure to check back regularly. [CLS] [SEP] we will also notify you by
posting an announcement on the website so you are always aware of what
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any,
it is disclosed. [CLS] [SEP] continuing to use our services after any changes have been
posted, constitutes your acceptance of any modifications to the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] contributions

**1.1 public content.** in general, all content (pages, images, files, etc.)
on miraheze is public, including any contributions made by miraheze community
members. [CLS] [SEP] the history of every edit to content made through the services is
publicly displayed and retained indefinitely by miraheze. [CLS] [SEP] even if an article
is "deleted," a website administrator or volunteer may still see what was
removed from public view. [CLS] [SEP] aside from the rare times when miraheze is required
to delete editing-history in response to a court order or legal process, there
is no guarantee that permanent deletion will occur. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.2 individual contributions.** if you contribute or edit content on through
the services ("contributions"), your contributions will be visible to the
public and may show up in search results of third-party search engines. [CLS] [SEP] if you
have registered an account with miraheze, your contributions will be
associated with your username. [CLS] [SEP] if you have not registered with miraheze, your
contributions will be associated with your ip address. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.3 private wikis.** some wikis may be marked as private, which means that
contributions therein are not normally released to the general public. [CLS] [SEP]
miraheze personnel and a small number of vetted volunteers have access to
content on private wikis as part of their role in assisting to provide our
services. [CLS] [SEP] access to content on private wikis is granted or revoked by the
creators and administrators of these wikis. [CLS] [SEP] be aware that the wiki
administrators can restrict your access to contributions you have made on a
private wiki, or even to make the entire wiki public content. [CLS] [SEP]

collect certain personal information, such as your email address, username and
password. [CLS] [SEP] your email address will remain private, unless you choose to post it
on public facing portions of the services, such as your profile page or the
contributors page. [CLS] [SEP] please use discretion on what you choose to post on public
facing portions of the services, as it will be available to the public and may
show up in search results of third-party engines. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2 username.** you will also be asked to create a username, which will be
used to identify when you are logged onto the services, and to identify your

**2.3 optional user information:** as a registered user, you may choose to
share more details publicly. [CLS] [SEP] you may provide your name, a personal website,
share your email address, and talk about yourself on your profile page. [CLS] [SEP] please

services, as it will be available to the public and may show up in search

information for statistical purposes to help administer, manage and improve
the services, prevent abuse, analyse trends, and to tailor your user

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] information collected by hosted wikis

while this policy applies to all wikis hosted by miraheze, the operators of
the hosted wikis may collect additional user information. [CLS] [SEP] miraheze does not
retain any of this data. [CLS] [SEP] any additional user information collected by a hosted
wiki must be described on the privacy policy page of that wiki and must be
collected in compliance with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you learn that a wiki is
collecting data beyond the scope of its privacy policy or in violation of the
law, please discontinue using that wiki and inform miraheze immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] cookies

cookies are small files that miraheze can send to your browser for storage on
your computer. [CLS] [SEP] cookies make using the services easier by saving your status

to clear this logon information, for example if using a public terminal, you
should log out of your account. [CLS] [SEP] while many browsers allow you to change your
settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being
sent, miraheze recommends that you leave cookies enabled, as disabling cookies
may prevent you from using and may interfere with some functionality of the
services. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition to automated messages sent by the services, users with verified
email addresses may wish to communicate with each other. [CLS] [SEP] by default, if you
have a verified email address, other users may use a special page
("emailuser") to send messages to you and vice versa. [CLS] [SEP] when you use emailuser

which includes your email address and the content you chose to send. [CLS] [SEP] your
