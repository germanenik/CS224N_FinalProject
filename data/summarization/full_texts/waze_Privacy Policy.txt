we’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that

# sharing your information

### personal information that you share

the services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information
with waze and with other members of that community. [CLS] [SEP]

in particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name,
age, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files. [CLS] [SEP]
this information may be shared either directly to the services and to all
users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on
waze. [CLS] [SEP] this information may also be shared via third party services (such as
social networks) which interact with the services upon such users’ choice. [CLS] [SEP] for
more information about your carpool profile (if you choose to set one), see
section titled waze carpool profile below. [CLS] [SEP]

**you can decide whether or not to upload content to the services. [CLS] [SEP] however any
content that you choose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor
confidential and you should expect that it may be made public and known to
others.** information you choose to upload will be posted along with your user
name and other information including personal information you attached to your
publicly available user profile. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your reports (map and road
updates, traffic congestion updates, road accidents, etc.) will be posted on
the waze map along with your username. [CLS] [SEP] you should note that certain road
incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of
those incidents. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when
submitting information. [CLS] [SEP] at the very least you should demonstrate the same
degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than
the internet and cellular services. [CLS] [SEP]

in any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared
from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such
social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others
through any reports or user posts that you share or upload. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to either record your own voice onto the service, or to use the
voice command features, waze will collect the voice information related to
such use, including voice files. [CLS] [SEP] if, after recording your own voice, you chose
to share your voice recordings, other waze users and other people will be able
to download and use your voice recordings. [CLS] [SEP] once downloaded, waze may not have
any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you
are comfortable being made public. [CLS] [SEP]

we, at waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you
can have while using the services. [CLS] [SEP] however, waze has no control over the
conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. [CLS] [SEP] users are
advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or
available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related
to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication
being made. [CLS] [SEP]

participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly,
from using waze, is entirely at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] waze is not a party to any
agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] the user has
the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws,
regulations or any other duty. [CLS] [SEP] we do not accept any liability for any loss,
damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in
connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or
conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement
between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in
any way, directly or indirectly, the services or the use thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

### when waze shares your information

waze does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

waze will not share your personal information with others, without your
permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in
waze’s good-faith discretion:

  * as necessary for the facilitation and operation of the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, making public road incidents you report and which are associated with your username and your location;

  * if waze reasonably believes that you have breached the terms of use or is investigating potential breach of the terms of use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the services, or performed any act or omission that waze reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. [CLS] [SEP] waze may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;

  * if waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;

  * in any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and waze, or between you and other users with respect to, or in relation with the services;

  * in any case where waze reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of waze, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;

  * to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;

  * if waze organizes the operation of the services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if waze is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if waze enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this privacy policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;

  * to collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting services or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to waze, as reasonable for business purposes, which may be located in the european union and the u.s.a., potentially countries outside of your jurisdiction;

  * waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] entities that belong to the google group of companies);

  * we work with other google’s services (such as google display and video 360) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on waze, google, and websites & apps that partner with google, we may share information with these services, such as a unique identifier for advertising (i.e, advertising id available on android mobile devices or similar technologies). [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about how google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in [this](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) page. [CLS] [SEP] for more information see section titled ‘advertising campaigns’ under this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we also work with selected advertising and measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with ads served in our platform and in order to provide marketing, advertising and measurement services for waze with respect to waze’s own marketing efforts, by using and sharing devices’ identifiers (i.e, advertising id, cookies or similar technologies). [CLS] [SEP]

  * personal information may also be shared with waze’s trusted partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use service providers to help us with customer services. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share information which does not personally identify you with third
party transportation services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, to allow you to find a carpool
rider on third party transportation services, such as moovit, we may share a
temporary unique identifier along with pick-up and drop-off points that are
generated based on proximity to your intended travel itinerary, with those
third party transportation services. [CLS] [SEP] you can review the list of the relevant
third party transportation services to your area and change your preferences
at any time via the in-app settings. [CLS] [SEP]

waze carpool partners with employers, organizations and governmental entities
(“waze carpool partners”) in order to encourage the use of carpooling. [CLS] [SEP] if you
have joined a carpool group which is promoted by a partner or any other third
party, your carpool profile (or other information you have chosen to share)
may be visible to other members of the group, including representatives of the
partner or third party who may also be part of the group. [CLS] [SEP]

# visibility

please note that your username and some other information will be visible to
others. [CLS] [SEP] note that your username will be included along with any information
you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). [CLS] [SEP] it will
therefore be visible to others. [CLS] [SEP] also - your friends on waze will see your name
& profile photo and any other information you chose to share with them. [CLS] [SEP]

if you prefer to remain invisible on the waze map, you can set the waze
application not to show your location on the map. [CLS] [SEP] to do so you should go to
the privacy settings and adjust accordingly by switching on to invisible mode. [CLS] [SEP]
if on, **some features may not be available**. [CLS] [SEP] if you make this choice, while
you will be ‘invisible’ on the map to other users, your location and route
information will continue to be collected by waze for the purposes listed in
this privacy policy and your carpool profile (if you choose to set one) may be
visible to other waze’s users. [CLS] [SEP]

# waze carpool profile

waze carpool is uniquely designed to help drivers and riders find a mutual
ride that fits them. [CLS] [SEP] if you have opted-in to use the waze carpool feature, you
will be required to create a unique profile. [CLS] [SEP]

your waze carpool profile includes your name, photo, number of completed rides
and carpooled km, the date you joined the services, information that you have
chosen to share from your social account, your carpool rating and endorsements
you have received, and any other information you shared about yourself (for
example your car details or any other information as part of “my preferences”
settings). [CLS] [SEP] you can edit some of this information through the in-app settings
or through your social account (in case you have chosen to share the
information from your social account). [CLS] [SEP]

a complete carpool profile is important so that riders or drivers can learn
more about you, and vice versa. [CLS] [SEP] your profile is therefore public to other waze
users and may be shared through our services. [CLS] [SEP] if you have joined the carpool
groups feature, your carpool profile will be visible to other group members,
including your co-workers or employer in case of work related groups. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to verify your work or university’s email address, your work or
university will be listed publicly on your profile as well (but your email
address will stay private). [CLS] [SEP]

note: your home and work addresses are not listed publicly on your profile,
but rather only be saved on your waze account. [CLS] [SEP] however, in certain
circumstances, your pickup/drop-off spots may be your home or work address if
for example you share a similar route with your driver or rider. [CLS] [SEP]

# integration with social networks

you may choose to share information between your waze account and your social
network account (such as facebook). [CLS] [SEP] through this option, you may choose to
have personal information and other content about you available from social
networks, transmitted and shared through the services. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, you may
choose to have personal information and other content about you available from
waze, including your location and route information, transmitted to and shared
through your social network account. [CLS] [SEP]

by setting your waze account to integrate with social networks, including by
signing onto waze by using your social network account, you agree to share
information (including personal information) between waze and such social
networks, for the purposes provided under this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

the social network’s use of information made available by waze is governed by
that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not
by this privacy policy or waze. [CLS] [SEP]

when you connect to the social network account through the services for the
first time or otherwise make the services interact with your social network
account, you will be asked by the social network to permit the social network
to share your personal information stored on such social network with waze. [CLS] [SEP] we
collect your information from your social network account only in accordance
with the permissions granted by you (such as your name, email address, list of
friends, profile picture and other information available via the applicable
social network). [CLS] [SEP]

you understand and agree that the services may access, make available and
store such information so that it is available on and through your waze
account, until your waze account is deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your
third party social network accounts may become public to other waze users
through the services once you have allowed the social network to share such
information with waze (for example through your carpool profile). [CLS] [SEP]

# integration with other third party services

waze may offer you the option to link waze to third party services that may be
useful to you (like, spotify). [CLS] [SEP] where waze detects an integration may be
available (either because a third party service attempts to link to waze, or
waze detects an installed service on the device which has an integration
option, or you request a particular integration), waze will ask for
confirmation to connect the accounts. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to connect the accounts,
waze will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. [CLS] [SEP]
you should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the
third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the
accounts and waze is not responsible for the third party service’s use of
data. [CLS] [SEP] you can disconnect waze and the third party service at any time and waze
will cease sharing data with that service from the point of disconnection
onwards. [CLS] [SEP]

# controlling your personal information

you can always review and update certain information by visiting your account
& login settings (such as your phone, name, photo and more) or the in-app left
menu (to update your home, work and favorites). [CLS] [SEP] if you joined waze carpool,
you can review and update your information (including this available on your
waze carpool profile) through the waze carpool in-app settings. [CLS] [SEP]

you can log on to the waze website to view your route history by going to
“edit the map”/ “drives” function on the waze website. [CLS] [SEP] note that in order to
access certain information you will need to register your account. [CLS] [SEP] your
location and route history is associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you find that the information associated with your account is not accurate,
complete or updated, then you should make all necessary changes to correct it. [CLS] [SEP]
please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent
you from setting up an account and impair the ability to provide you with
services. [CLS] [SEP]

### privacy controls

your in-app privacy settings provide you with quick access to settings and
tools that let you safeguard your data and decide how your information can
make waze services work better for you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you can control your
visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown to you
on waze. [CLS] [SEP] if you joined waze carpool, you can access more controls through your
carpool activity and other in-app settings. [CLS] [SEP]

there are other ways to control the information waze collects whether or not
you’re signed in to a waze account, including device-level settings: your
device may have controls that determine what information we collect. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, you can modify location settings on your device. [CLS] [SEP]

### deleting your information

if you would like us to delete your account, please use the “delete account”
function available under the in-app privacy setting and on the [waze
website](/dashboard). [CLS] [SEP] on receiving such a request, waze will use reasonable
efforts to delete such information, however please note that information may
not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems. [CLS] [SEP] we aim to initiate the
deletion process immediately after your request. [CLS] [SEP] once we receive your request,
your data will no longer be used to personalize your waze experience. [CLS] [SEP] we then
begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our
storage systems. [CLS] [SEP] this process generally takes around 2 months from the time of
deletion. [CLS] [SEP] as with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance,
unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the
processes and time frames defined in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we maintain systems designed
to detect and remediate such issues. [CLS] [SEP]

# how waze retains data we collect

some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted
automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when
necessary. [CLS] [SEP] this section describes why we hold onto different types of data for
different periods of time. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **information retained until you remove it** \- such as your “home, “work”, favorites, email address and other account related information. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll keep this data in your waze account until you choose to remove it and/or update it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **data that expires after a specific period of time** \- in some cases, you don’t need to actively delete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data’s collection. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you choose to connect your calendar to your waze account, we extract your calendar events for several days in advance and delete them after their occurrence. [CLS] [SEP] we may also take steps to anonymize certain data within set timeperiods. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **information retained until your waze account is deleted** \- we may keep some data for the life of your waze account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you made an incident report, we will keep information about how many reports you have submitted, even after the event is removed. [CLS] [SEP] when you delete your waze account, the information about how many reports you have submitted is also removed. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes** \- sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when waze processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. [CLS] [SEP] reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include: 
    * security, fraud & abuse prevention
    * financial record-keeping
    * complying with legal or regulatory requirements
    * ensuring the continuity of our services
    * direct communications with waze

# how does waze use aggregated information?

waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including
anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the
identification of a specific user, to properly operate the services, to
improve the quality of the services, to enhance your experience, to create new
services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel
existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and
statistical purposes (including advertising). [CLS] [SEP]

waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected
on the services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a
specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise
communicating or making available such information to users of the services,
to the services’ providers, partners and any other third party. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
gps information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map
editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and
solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, aggregated use of
waze carpool may be provided to carpool partners and aggregated ads analysis
may be provided to advertisers. [CLS] [SEP]

# cookies

waze may use cookies and similar technologies on the services. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are
packets of information sent by the website’s servers to your web browser and
then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the website’s servers. [CLS] [SEP]

waze may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-
enter your username and password each time you log in, to facilitate the use

to customize the website to your personal preferences and for information
security purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

# advertising campaigns

waze allows advertisers to run ad campaigns on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

the information and advertisements that you see when accessing the services
may be targeted on the basis of your current waze activity, such as your
current location, your destination or contextual information based on your
current drive session. [CLS] [SEP] for example: if you search for “gas station” you may
see an ad for a local gas station. [CLS] [SEP]

depending on your settings, you may also see **ads personalized** to you based
on:

  * information we received from you (for example, your saved “home” & “work” addresses)
  * past activity and search query history (for example, drives that appear in your drive list)
  * information from our ad partners, including entities that belong to the google group of companies and other trusted ad partners. [CLS] [SEP]

you can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-
app **privacy settings– >ads personalization**. [CLS] [SEP] note: turning ads
personalization off does not turn off ads - only their personalization. [CLS] [SEP]

please note:

  * we don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop. [CLS] [SEP]
  * as described under “when waze shares your information” section above, we work with other google’s services (such as google doubleclick bid manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on waze, google, and websites & apps that partner with google, waze may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising (advertising id available on android mobile devices or similar technologies). [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about how google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in [this page](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). [CLS] [SEP]
  * the ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by waze **on the waze platform** and they do not apply to ads served on third parties platforms, including on waze’s behalf. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you visit a third party website from the application, such third party may use cookies on your computer. [CLS] [SEP] the third party’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not to this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you should visit their services, or contact them directly. [CLS] [SEP]

the services includes an internal messaging system which provides you the
ability to send and receive messages to and from other users, and to receive
marketing messages from us. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby agree that we may use the internal
messaging system for the purpose of informing you regarding products or
services, which may interest you. [CLS] [SEP]

please note however that other waze users are not allowed to use your contact
details or our internal messaging account for commercial advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
if you have encountered any user generated advertising material, please inform
us through the channels listed on the “about” menu in the software or through
the “contact us” page on the site [link here](/about/contact). [CLS] [SEP]

it is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said
advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by
third parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not
be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you
may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

# information security

waze considers information security to be a top priority. [CLS] [SEP] waze services are
built with strong security features that continuously protect your
information. [CLS] [SEP] waze implements systems, applications and procedures to secure
your personal information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of
information, or unauthorized access or use of information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we
review our information collection, storage, and processing practices,
including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our
systems. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we restrict access to personal information to waze
employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to
process it. [CLS] [SEP] anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual
confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail
to meet these obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

the insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and
automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. [CLS] [SEP]

however, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. [CLS] [SEP] therefore,
although waze takes great efforts to protect your personal information, waze
cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that waze’s databases will
be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or
access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. [CLS] [SEP]
