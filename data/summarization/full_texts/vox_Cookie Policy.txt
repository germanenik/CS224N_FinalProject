  2. [CLS] [SEP] ## cookies and other tracking technologies, and how we use them

like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies on our
site (collectively “cookies”, unless otherwise stated) including http cookies,
html5 and flash local storage, web beacons/gifs, embedded scripts and
e-tags/cache browsers as defined below. [CLS] [SEP]

we use cookies for a variety of purposes and to enhance your online
experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status and viewing
preferences from a previous use of an online service, for when you later
return to that online service. [CLS] [SEP]

in particular, our site uses the following categories of cookies as described
in section 2 of our [privacy notice](/legal/privacy-notice):

### cookies and local storage

type of cookie | purpose  
---|---  
analytics and performance cookies | these cookies are used to collect
information about traffic to our services and how users use our services. [CLS] [SEP] the
information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. [CLS] [SEP] the information
is aggregated and therefore anonymous. [CLS] [SEP] it includes the number of visitors to
our services, the websites that referred them to our services, the pages that
they visited on our services, what time of day they visited our services,
whether they have visited our services before, and other similar information. [CLS] [SEP]
we use this information to help operate our services more efficiently, to
gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on
our services. [CLS] [SEP] we use google analytics for this purpose. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics uses
its own cookies. [CLS] [SEP] it is only used to improve how our services works. [CLS] [SEP] you can
find out more information about google analytics cookies
[here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaconceptscookies). [CLS] [SEP]
you can find out more about how google protects your data
[here](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). [CLS] [SEP] you can prevent
the use of google analytics relating to your use of our services by
downloading and installing the browser plugin available
[here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-gb). [CLS] [SEP]  
service cookies | these cookies are essential to provide you with services
available through our services and to enable you to use its features. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our services and help the
content of the pages you request load quickly. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, the
services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these
cookies to provide you with those services. [CLS] [SEP]  
functionality cookies | these cookies allow our services to remember choices
you make when you use our services, such as remembering your language
preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have
voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the
changes you make to other parts of our services which you can customize. [CLS] [SEP] the
purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and
to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our
services. [CLS] [SEP]  
social media cookies | these cookies are used when you share information using
a social media sharing button or “like” button on our services or you link
your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking
website such as facebook, twitter or google+. [CLS] [SEP] the social network will record
that you have done this and collect information from you which may be your
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an eu citizen we only use these cookies with
your affirmative consent. [CLS] [SEP]  
targeted and advertising cookies | these cookies track your browsing habits to
enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP]
these cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with
other users who have similar interests. [CLS] [SEP] based on that information, and with
our permission, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to
show ads which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on
third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies also store your location, including your
latitude, longitude, and geoip region id, which helps us show you locale-
specific news and allows our services to operate more efficiently. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
an eu citizen we only use these cookies with your affirmative consent. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
your use of our site indicates your consent to such use of cookies, unless
otherwise specified. [CLS] [SEP] cookies used for analytics and performance, service
cookies, and functionality cookies are considered strictly necessary, or
essential, and are collected from all users based on our legitimate interest
and for a business purpose, such as bug fixing, bot detection, security,
providing the content, providing an account or service, and loading necessary
applications among other similar uses. [CLS] [SEP] cookies that are not strictly
necessary, or non-essential, are collected based on your consent, which may be
given or withheld by different means depending on where you live. [CLS] [SEP] for further
information about our use of cookies and your opt-out choices, see your cookie
choices and how to opt-out. [CLS] [SEP] see here for examples of each type of cookie used
on our site. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] ## use of cookies and tracking technologies by our advertising partners

the advertising networks and/or content providers that deliver ads on our site
use cookies to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of
information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of
ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared. [CLS] [SEP]

many of these companies combine information they collect from our site with
other information they have independently collected relating to your web
browser’s activities across their network of websites. [CLS] [SEP] these companies collect
and use this information under their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

these companies, their privacy policies and the opt-outs they offer can be
found in the table below. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also opt-out of additional third-party advertising networks by going
to the [network advertising initiative’s
website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), the [digital
advertising alliance adchoices
website](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=en), or the [european daa
website](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (for the eu/uk), the [appchoices
website](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) (for mobile app opt-out) and
following the directions there. [CLS] [SEP]

although we are not responsible for the effectiveness of these opt-out
solutions, and in additional to other specific rights, california residents
are entitled to know the effects of opt-out options under california business
& professions code section 22575(b)(7). [CLS] [SEP] the effect of an opt-out, if
successful, will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the
collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and
internal site operation purposes). [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] ## your cookie choices and how to opt-out

you have the choice whether to accept the use of cookies and we have explained
how you can exercise your rights below. [CLS] [SEP]

most browsers are initially set up to accept http cookies. [CLS] [SEP] the “help” feature
of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new
cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, and how to disable
existing cookies. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about http cookies and how to disable
them, you can consult the information at [allaboutcookies.org/manage-
cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). [CLS] [SEP]

controlling the html5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser
you use. [CLS] [SEP] for more information regarding your specific browser, please consult
the browser’s website (often in the “help” section). [CLS] [SEP]

on most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. [CLS] [SEP] please
refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when
you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. [CLS] [SEP] please see the
links below for guidance on how to modify your web browser’s settings on the
most popular browsers:

    * internet explorer
    * mozilla firefox
    * google chrome
    * apple safari

if you access the sites on your mobile device, you may not be able to control
tracking technologies through the settings. [CLS] [SEP] you should check your mobile
device’s settings to determine whether you can control cookies through your
mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]

please note, however, that without http cookies and html5 and flash local
storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features
and parts of the site will not function properly. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see
ads when you visit our site. [CLS] [SEP]

throughout our sites, we link out to other websites, such as publications,
affiliates, advertisers, and partners. [CLS] [SEP] you should review other website
operators’ privacy and cookie policies to determine the type and extent of
tracking devices used by these other websites. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] ## cookies and tracking technologies used on vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] site

the following table sets out details of the individual partners and cookies we
may use and the purposes for which we use them. [CLS] [SEP]

we are not fully responsible for third-party sites and their privacy practices
as it relates to opt-outs from tracking activities. [CLS] [SEP] the following third-
parties that collect information from you on our site have given us notice
that you can obtain information on their policies and practices, and in some

  6. [CLS] [SEP] ## consent

unless otherwise specified, if you do not opt out, as provided through the
various methods herein, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and
sharing of your information by us and the third parties listed above, subject
to their privacy policies, preferences, and opt-outs available through the
links set forth above. [CLS] [SEP] not in limitation of the foregoing, you expressly
consent to the use of cookies or other local storage and the collection, use,
and sharing of your information by us and each google entity identified in the
cookies and tracking technologies used on vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] site section above. [CLS] [SEP]
you can revoke your consent at any time by following the procedures set forth
in the your cookie choices and how to opt-out section above and otherwise as
provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] certain information collected through cookies and other
tracking technology does not require affirmative consent and you will not be
able to opt out of collection. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about online tracking and
options to prevent most tracking visit the [future of privacy forum
site](https://allaboutdnt.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

  7. [CLS] [SEP] ## definitions

### cookies

a cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or lso) is a data file
placed on a device. [CLS] [SEP] cookies can be created through a variety of web-related
protocols and technologies, such as http (sometimes referred to as “browser
cookies”), html5, or adobe flash. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on third-party cookies
that we use for analytics, please review the table of cookies and tracking
technologies within this cookies and tracking technologies policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### web beacons

small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also
known as “1×1 gifs” or “clear gifs”) can be included in our online service’s
pages and messages. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons are invisible to you, but any electronic image
or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web
beacon. [CLS] [SEP]

clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
cookies. [CLS] [SEP] in contrast to http cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer
hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the
size of the period at the end of this sentence. [CLS] [SEP]

### deterministic finger-printing technologies

if a user can be positively identified across multiple devices, for instance,
because the user has logged into a platform such as google, facebook, yahoo or
twitter, it can be “determined” who the user is for purposes of improving
customer service. [CLS] [SEP]

### probabilistic finger-printing

probabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal data regarding
device attributes like operating system, device make and model, ip addresses,
ad requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link
multiple devices to a single user. [CLS] [SEP] note that this is accomplished through
proprietary algorithms owned by the companies performing probabilistic finger-
printing. [CLS] [SEP] note also that in the eu ip addresses are personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

### device graph

device graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of
smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track
interactions with content across multiple devices. [CLS] [SEP]

### unique identifier header (uidh)

“unique identifier header (uidh) is the address information that accompanies
internet (http) requests transmitted over an isp’s wireless network. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a
retailer that request travels over the network and is delivered to the
retailer’s website. [CLS] [SEP] the information included in that request includes things
like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to
best display the site on the phone. [CLS] [SEP] the uidh is included in this information,
and can be used as an anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine
that the user is part of a group that a third-party advertiser is attempting
to reach. [CLS] [SEP]

it is important to note that the uidh is a temporary, anonymous identifier
included with unencrypted web traffic. [CLS] [SEP] we change the uidh on a regular basis
to protect the privacy of our customers. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use the uidh to collect web
browsing information and it does not broadcast individuals’ web browsing
activity out to advertisers or others.”

### embedded script

an embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information
about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click
on. [CLS] [SEP] the code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or
a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the
online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. [CLS] [SEP]

### etag, or entity tag

a feature of the cache in browsers, an etag is an opaque identifier assigned
by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a url. [CLS] [SEP] if the
resource content at that url ever changes, a new and different etag is
assigned. [CLS] [SEP] used in this manner etags are a form of device identifier. [CLS] [SEP] etag
tracking generates unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks http,
flash, and/or html5 cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

### unique device tokens

for each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app
developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address)
from the app platform (e.g., apple and google). [CLS] [SEP]

### unique device id

the unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device. [CLS] [SEP]
