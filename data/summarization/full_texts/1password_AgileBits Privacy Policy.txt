# agilebits privacy policy

#### much more than just a policy â 1password is private by design

![legal cat](/img/legal/legalcat.431d314a44a8e13be3befee36dede27e.svg)

## last updated: july 3, 2019

your privacy is important to us. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy explains the personal
data that agilebits collects and processes, how it processes data and for what
purposes it is collected and processed. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy further describes
our commitment to preserving the privacy and security of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]
this policy applies to the interactions that agilebits has with you through
your use of agilebits 1password products and services. [CLS] [SEP]

## brief overview of our commitment to privacy

at agilebits, we believe that the less information we know about you, the
better. [CLS] [SEP] after all, it is impossible to lose, misuse, or abuse information we
donât have. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent that we have control over your data or data about
you, we see ourselves as custodians of that data on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

we use your data solely to provide you with services in which you enroll. [CLS] [SEP] our
business is providing 1password products and services to you, the customer. [CLS] [SEP] we
have no desire or interest to use or transfer the limited data we acquire for
any other purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## who we are

agilebits is a canadian company located at suite 303, 49 spadina ave, toronto,
ontario, m5v 2j1, canada. [CLS] [SEP] agilebits complies with canadian privacy laws. [CLS] [SEP] we
are fully compliant with the canadian privacy laws and the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] the european
union ("eu") recognizes canada as a destination country with âadequate level
of protectionâ for data privacy of individuals. [CLS] [SEP] we are not u.s.- eu privacy
shield certified since we are a canadian company. [CLS] [SEP]

## who are you

unless otherwise noted, we refer you, the customer, as an owner or organizer
of an individual, family, team, or business account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you represent an organization, such as a business or educational
institution, that utilizes 1password products or services through enterprise
accounts or if you are an end user of 1password product or a 1password account
provided by your organization, please see theâ 1password enterprise accounts
section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. [CLS] [SEP]

## non-owners

if you are a non-owner member of a team, business, or family account, your use
of 1password may be subject to your organizationâs privacy policy or
practices, if any. [CLS] [SEP] non-owner members of an account transfer some of the rights
described here to the account owners. [CLS] [SEP]

## personal data we collect and how we use your personal data

we do not collect or obtain data from third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we collect some data from
you, in order to provide you with our 1password products and associated
services. [CLS] [SEP] you provide some data directly, such as when you create a 1password
account, when you register for a 1password event or a webinar, or contact us
for support. [CLS] [SEP] such data is limited to your email address only. [CLS] [SEP] we get some
limited data from your use of the 1password products and services. [CLS] [SEP] such data
includes your ip address, and the make and model of your device through which
you access or use 1password products or services. [CLS] [SEP]

we use your personal data to provide you with services associated with the use
of 1password account and to provide you with a rich customer experience
through our customer support. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, we use your data to provide
1password services, which includes updating, securing and troubleshooting, and
providing support. [CLS] [SEP]

the following is a more detailed description of the types of 1password account
user data:

we process two kinds of user data to deliver our services: (i) secure data and
(ii) service data. [CLS] [SEP] both are treated securely with respect for customer privacy
and data confidentiality, but there are important technical and usage
differences. [CLS] [SEP]

### (i) secure data

secure data are the data that we are not capable of decrypting under any
circumstance. [CLS] [SEP] it includes all information stored within vaults in 1password
accounts. [CLS] [SEP] these data are encrypted using secure cryptographic keys that exist
only in the possession and under the control of our customers. [CLS] [SEP] we have no way
of accessing or providing decrypted secure data, and we never receive copies
of unencrypted secure data. [CLS] [SEP]

your secure data is your property. [CLS] [SEP] we claim no rights to it beyond those
necessary to deliver services to you. [CLS] [SEP] you may add, modify, and delete secure
data at your discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not have a 1password account, you cannot
provide us with secure data. [CLS] [SEP]

### (ii) service data

we inevitably acquire service data about your usage of 1password, your
account, and your payments through operating our services. [CLS] [SEP] we retain only
enough service data to operate and maintain the services. [CLS] [SEP] these data are never
used for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

service data are kept confidential. [CLS] [SEP] it is visible to our staff and includes,
but is not limited to, server logs, billing information, client ip addresses,
number of vaults and number of items in vaults, company or family name, and
email addresses. [CLS] [SEP] service data includes the name you provide us for your
profile and any image that you may upload, at your option and discretion, as
part of your profile. [CLS] [SEP]

as long as you are using our services, we retain the right to hold and use
service data to provide our services, troubleshoot problems, analyze the
performance and demands on our services, and to provide our payment processors
with the information they need to process payments. [CLS] [SEP]

### (iii) diagnostic data (optional)

diagnostic data are a category of service data which are not automatically
collected or required for operation of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases we seek diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug, and
crash reports from customers to help identify and solve problems with our
products and services. [CLS] [SEP] this information is sent to us only on a case by case
basis, or by users who explicitly opt into our beta software programs or who
otherwise explicitly choose to provide diagnostic data to us. [CLS] [SEP]

diagnostic data may contain sensitive information about your devices and
operating environment as well as personally identifying information. [CLS] [SEP] although
there may be occasions when we ask for diagnostic data to assist you with a
problem, you are never obligated to provide it. [CLS] [SEP]

diagnostic data never includes decrypted secure data. [CLS] [SEP] we will never ask for
your master password or secret key. [CLS] [SEP]

## keeping your information safe

we understand and accept our responsibility to protect service data and secure
data. [CLS] [SEP] we use strict access control mechanisms, network isolation, and
encryption to ensure that secure and service data is only available to
authorized personnel. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, secure data cannot be decrypted even by
those who do have access to it. [CLS] [SEP]

## compliance with the laws

agilebits fully complies with the canadian privacy laws and the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]
agilebits is a canadian company, we are not u.s.- e.u. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield
certified. [CLS] [SEP] if you are affiliated to an organization who provides you with
1password account through its enterprise level account then there may be
additional requirements for us to meet, based on the contracts with the
organization. [CLS] [SEP] for further information, please read below the section 1password
product or account provided by your organization. [CLS] [SEP]

### data location and transfer

1password.eu data are held on servers located within the european union. [CLS] [SEP] data
originating in the european union remains within the european union. [CLS] [SEP] service
data access is restricted to members of our staff residing in either the eu or
canada. [CLS] [SEP] the european union recognizes canada as a destination country with
"adequate level of protection" for data privacy of individuals. [CLS] [SEP]

### customer support system

our customer support and email services are hosted primarily in the united
states. [CLS] [SEP] any information you choose send us through email or our customer
support system may pass through and be stored on a variety of intermediate
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish, you may encrypt email to us using ourâ [pgp public
key](https://1password.com/support-at-agilebits-pubkey-42f3d4d4.asc). [CLS] [SEP]

### third-party data processors

your secure and service data are held by third party data processors, who
provide us with hosting and other infrastructure services. [CLS] [SEP] the locations of
these are described above. [CLS] [SEP] in many cases (but we cannot promise that this will
always be the case) even service data held by these entities is encrypted with
keys held only by us. [CLS] [SEP]

data needed to process payments is collected by our payment processor, stripe,
inc., which conforms to the u.s.-e.u. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework. [CLS] [SEP] seeâ
<https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy>

## contacting you

we may use your contact information, that is, the contact email address
provided by you, to communicate with you about service activity, provide
support, and send you other information such as product updates and
announcements. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to stop receiving communications from us, except
certain important notifications such as billing and account security alerts. [CLS] [SEP]

## your responsibilities for protecting your data

when you create a 1password account you will receive a secret key and will be
prompted to create a master password. [CLS] [SEP] your secret key is generated on your
computer and your master password is something you create yourself. [CLS] [SEP] for your
protection, you should create a strong and unique master password to ensure
that it is not easily guessed. [CLS] [SEP]

it is extremely important that you understand that anyone with both your
secret key and master password can access your secure data. [CLS] [SEP] it is equally
important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own reference, because
future access to your secure data depends on having access to both your secret
key and your master password. [CLS] [SEP] we will never ask you for your master password
or your full secret key, and you should never send it to us or anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

due to the nature of our design and the sensitivity of the information you
entrust to us (even in encrypted form), it may not be possible for us to help
you with certain customer service requests unless you are listed as an account
owner and are communicating from your verified email address. [CLS] [SEP] in the event
that you change your email address, it is very important that you update your
email on your 1password account(s) or you may eventually lose access. [CLS] [SEP]

## data protection principles that we practice

### (i) data portability

we want happy customers, not trapped ones. [CLS] [SEP] we will not lock you out of your
own data. [CLS] [SEP] however, we are unable to decrypt your secure data; you will need
your master password and secret key to decrypt it. [CLS] [SEP]

you may export your 1password data at any time you wish during the life of
your account. [CLS] [SEP] if you discontinue payment, your account will enter a frozen
(read-only) state for a period not less than six months during which you may
still retrieve and export your data. [CLS] [SEP]

export is limited to your secure data. [CLS] [SEP] vault permissions, the structure of
groups of individuals, and other information about the relationship between
individuals and data is not guaranteed to be included in export. [CLS] [SEP]

### (ii) your right to know to what we know

you have the right to know what we know about you and to see how that data is
handled. [CLS] [SEP] you may request a screenshot of what we can see about you in our back
office systems. [CLS] [SEP] however, to protect customer privacy, such requests must be
carefully authenticated beyond demonstrating control of the customerâs email
address. [CLS] [SEP]

### (iii) your right to have your data erased

as we are merely custodians of your data, account owners have the right to
instruct us to remove data permanently from our systems. [CLS] [SEP] to ensure that no
oneâs data is deleted without their consent, you must first delete your
account through an authenticated session. [CLS] [SEP] after your account has been deleted,
the account owner may contact us and ask for the data to be expunged. [CLS] [SEP] once the
request is authenticated, the data will be removed from our active systems
within 72 hours. [CLS] [SEP]

disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that agilebits has a
legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups. [CLS] [SEP] backups are
kept for 35 days. [CLS] [SEP] erasure requests will leave those backups untouched, and we
will only remove data from backups if legally compelled to. [CLS] [SEP]

### (iv) your right to access and control your personal data

you can also make choices about collection and use of your data by agilebits. [CLS] [SEP]
you can control your personal data and exercise your data protection rights by
contacting agilebits at the address and information provided below. [CLS] [SEP] you can
add, remove, edit, change any data that are in the 1password vault. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
an affiliate of an organization which provides you with the access to
1password account and services, there may be certain restrictions to the
above, based on your affiliate organizationâs privacy or other similar
policies. [CLS] [SEP] for further details, please review below the section under 1password
product or account provided by your organization. [CLS] [SEP]

## cookies and tracking

we do not engage in or support cross-service tracking. [CLS] [SEP]

we do set and use cookies (small text files placed on your device) on our own
domains and subdomains to store settings that assist with identifying your
account for sign-in. [CLS] [SEP] we also use third party analytics packages for our public
pages that may set cookies on your computer. [CLS] [SEP] these are limited to our domains,
and do not involve cross-service tracking. [CLS] [SEP] you may disable cookies in your
browser and continue to use our services without impact. [CLS] [SEP]

client applications, including web browsers, will store information about your
account to assist with future sign-ins and keep some information available to
you when you are not signed in. [CLS] [SEP] users may remove all such information from
their devices, but doing so will require that they provide complete
information (account details, master password, and secret key) on subsequent
sign-ins. [CLS] [SEP]

## consent for underage enrollment

those under the age of 16 may not use the services without the consent or
authorization of their parent or legal custodian. [CLS] [SEP] family account organizers
and team owners are responsible for that authorization when they add someone
under the age of 16 to an account. [CLS] [SEP]

## disclosure

we will comply with applicable laws and the contracts with our customers to
provide service data and encrypted secure data to law enforcement agencies. [CLS] [SEP] if
permitted, we will notify you of such a request and whether or not we have
complied. [CLS] [SEP] your secure data remains encrypted with keys which we do not
possess, and so we can only hand over secure data in encrypted form. [CLS] [SEP]

some service data is made available to family account organizers and team
owners. [CLS] [SEP] in some limited circumstances we may provide some information to non-
owner members of these accounts. [CLS] [SEP] account owners will be informed in these
circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

## breach notification

in an event of a breach, we recognize our responsibility to our customers and
to the public to disclose the nature of the risk and provide a transparent
account of the events without undue delay. [CLS] [SEP] we follow applicable requirements
under the laws, that is, the canadian data privacy breach notification
requirements and the requirements related to data breach notification under
the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1password product or account provided by your organization

when we offer 1password products and services to you through your
organization, we continue to adhere to the canadian privacy laws and the data
protection requirements under the gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] we follow the canadian data privacy
laws and the gdpr, in addition to any requirements under the contracts with
your organization, to ensure that your data are located, and if applicable,
appropriately transferred. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use a 1password product or 1password account to access our products and
services, and such 1password product or 1password account was provided by the
organization that you are affiliated with, that organization is the controller
or the administrator of your 1password product or 1password account. [CLS] [SEP] your
organization can access and process your data associated with your 1password
product or account. [CLS] [SEP] if your organization provides you with access to 1password
product or 1password account, your use of the product or account is subject to
your organisationâs policies, if any. [CLS] [SEP] you should direct your privacy
inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to
your organizationâs administrator. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the privacy or
security practices of your organization, which may differ from those set out
in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if you lose access to the organization that you are affiliated with (for
example, if you change your employment), you may lose access to 1password
product or 1password account and the content or data associated with such
product or account. [CLS] [SEP]

## updates to our privacy policy

at our discretion, we may make changes to this policy and note the date of the
last revision. [CLS] [SEP] you should check here frequently if you need to know of updates
to our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we maintain the right to send you annoying email
informing you of substantive changes. [CLS] [SEP] previous versions will be made available
from this page. [CLS] [SEP]
