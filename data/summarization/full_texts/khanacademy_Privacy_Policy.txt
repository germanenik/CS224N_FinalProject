## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] what information do we collect?

 **we take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to
put you in control of decisions around your information.**

you can use many features of the service without registering for an account or
providing any other personal information. [CLS] [SEP] if you create an account on the khan
academy service, or communicate with khan academy, you may provide to khan
academy what is generally called “personal information” or “personal data,”
such as your full name, birthdate, email address or other information that can
be used to identify you. [CLS] [SEP] information which cannot be used to identify you as
an individual is “de-identified” or non-personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect information, including personal information, in a variety of ways
which may vary according to your use of the service and your account settings. [CLS] [SEP]
the categories of personal information we collect may include:

  * contact and profile information
  * account and authentication information from third-party integrated services
  * location information
  * information about your browser or device
  * donation and applicant data
  * non-personal information which may be linked to your personal information

below, we describe examples of the categories of information we collect from
and about you when you use our service:

#### information you provide to us and information we receive about you from
others

##### contact and profile information. [CLS] [SEP]

when you create an account on the khan academy service, or communicate with
us, we may collect personal information including your name, email address,
and birthdate. [CLS] [SEP] after you register, you may also choose to provide additional
information in your profile, such as your nickname, location (city), and other
personal or demographic information. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may ask you for personal
information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support
team, send us an email, complete a user survey, or otherwise communicate with
khan academy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information from integrated sign-on services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party
social networking or integrated service (what we call an “integrated
service”), such as facebook, google, clever or similar single sign-on service,
khan academy may also collect personal information that is already associated
with your integrated service account. [CLS] [SEP] you may also have the option of sharing
additional information with khan academy through an integrated service, as
controlled through your settings on that integrated service. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to
provide such information, during registration or otherwise, khan academy will
treat the information as personal information and will use it in the ways
described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information obtained from other users. [CLS] [SEP]

we make available certain features on our service that allow other users to
provide us information about you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a parent or teacher may provide
information relating to a child user, such as when a parent registers an
account for their child and provide us with certain information about the
child, such as user name and age. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information provided by partners and other sources. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also receive information from third party organizations with which we
partner to provide educational services. [CLS] [SEP] if we combine or associate
information from other sources with personal information that we collect
through our service, we will treat the combined information as personal
information in accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

##### information we collect to enable your participation in special programs
or features. [CLS] [SEP]

from time to time, khan academy may feature a special program or activity we
offer in partnership with a third party. [CLS] [SEP] if you participate in these special
programs, khan academy may collect personal information from you to facilitate
those programs. [CLS] [SEP] for example, learnstorm participants may be asked to provide
information related to event logistics and prize awarding and processing
(e.g., contact information, dietary restrictions, shirt sizes, etc.), and
college board program participants may provide information regarding study
habits and test scores (e.g., the number of hours studied, modules or tests
taken, scores earned, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

#### information about how you access and use the service

##### information about your use of our service. [CLS] [SEP]

we may collect usage information about your use of our service, such as the
number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed,
and the amount of time spent to complete a problem. [CLS] [SEP] this enables us to better
tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you. [CLS] [SEP]

##### location information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may collect and use information about your location (such as your country)
or infer your approximate location based on your ip address in order to
provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region, but we
don't collect the precise geolocation of you or your device. [CLS] [SEP] you may be able
to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from
providing us with any location information. [CLS] [SEP]

#### other information

##### donation and applicant information. [CLS] [SEP]

if you donate to khan academy via paypal, we may obtain your name and mailing
address to send a thank you note, or if you apply for a job with khan academy
via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in
your application for that purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

##### usage and device information. [CLS] [SEP]

to provide a personalized learning and high-quality experience for our users,
we may use various technologies that automatically record certain technical
information from your browser or device when you visit our website, read our
emails, use our service or otherwise engage with us. [CLS] [SEP] this information is
typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including
cookies, web beacons, flash objects, log files, and similar technology
(collectively, “tracking technologies”). [CLS] [SEP] these tracking technologies cookies
collect information about how you use the service (e.g., the pages you view,
the links you click, and other actions you take on the service), information
about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., internet protocol (“ip”)
address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and urls,
pages viewed, whether you opened an email, links clicked), and information
about the device(s) you use to access the service (e.g., mobile device
identifier, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device
operating system brand and model, and whether you access the service from
multiple devices). [CLS] [SEP] we may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics
tools such as google analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends
for the sites and to understand more about the demographics of our users. [CLS] [SEP] you
can learn more about google's practices at
<http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>, and view its currently
available opt-out options at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also work with third party partners to employ technologies, including the
application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and
contact you across multiple devices. [CLS] [SEP] although we do our best to honor the
privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to do not track
signals set by your browser at this time. [CLS] [SEP]

we use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to better
display our website, to save you time, to provide better technical support,
for promotional purposes, and to track website usage. [CLS] [SEP] for example, cookies
help us to:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] customize the function and appearance of the pages you visit based on information relating to your account; for example, in order to default you to a particular study level, or to remember customized settings for a report. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] track website usage for various purposes including sales, marketing, and billing. [CLS] [SEP]

most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. [CLS] [SEP]
however, some features and services (particularly those that require you to
sign-in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. [CLS] [SEP] you may also
set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may
contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our
email and performed certain functions with it. [CLS] [SEP]

deleting cookies does not delete local storage objects (lsos) such as flash
objects and html5. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about flash objects - including how to
manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies – on adobe’s website or
by clicking [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-
shared-objects-flash.html). [CLS] [SEP] various browsers may offer their own management
tools for removing html5 lsos. [CLS] [SEP] please consult your browser’s “help” function
to learn more. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to delete flash objects from our sites, then you
may not be able to access and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the
information and services offered. [CLS] [SEP]

we and our third-party partners may also use cookies and tracking technologies
for advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about tracking technologies,

the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] how we share or transfer data

khan academy takes great care to protect the information you provide us. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not rent or sell personal information that we collect from users with third
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy will disclose personal information when you post content which is
visible to others on the service, when you consent or instruct us to share
your personal information with third parties, or when we have a legitimate
business or legal need to share your information. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose
anonymous or aggregate information that does not reasonably identify you as an
individual. [CLS] [SEP] to learn more, see additional description below. [CLS] [SEP]

##### when information is visible to others on the service by default. [CLS] [SEP]

certain features and functions of the service shares or makes your information
accessible to others. [CLS] [SEP] as with most online services, once you make your
personal information available to others online, it may be collected and used
by the recipients or any other website visitor without restriction. [CLS] [SEP] you may
wish to use a nickname or alias in your profile if you do not want your
personal information shared with others in this way. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your
personal information may be visible to others in the following circumstances:

  *  **information you post to public spaces of the service.** when you post a question or answer to the service, your profile, which could include your name, short biography, and city-level location, as well as the content of your posted comment, is visible to others on the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **connecting with a coach.** when your account is connected to a coach on the service, the coach will be able to see your profile information and your activities on the service, such as which videos you have watched, the questions and responses you post, and other usage information. [CLS] [SEP] coaches may also be able to see your name (not only your username) as well as your email address, if you include that information in your account profile. [CLS] [SEP]

##### with your consent or according to your instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

you may provide consent or authorization to share your personal information
with third party applications or services in several ways. [CLS] [SEP] please note that
these third parties are not governed by khan academy or the terms of this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend you review the privacy policy of any third party
application or service before authorizing access to your khan academy account
information. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **we may share data with social networks at your request.** some of our users choose to connect their khan academy account with social networks. [CLS] [SEP] this functionality is entirely optional. [CLS] [SEP] if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so, khan academy may disclose your personal information through a social network or similar service (like facebook or google). [CLS] [SEP] to control the information that you share, you have the option of modifying your khan academy or social network settings or disconnecting your social network account from your khan academy account. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **we may share data with third-party applications that you authorize.** third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as “app developers”) may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our resources, or may use our khan academy content to build unaffiliated applications and services. [CLS] [SEP] if you connect your khan academy account to an application or service, or approve access to your khan academy account by a third party application or service, you consent to khan academy sharing your information with that third party. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **we may share data in connection with special programs you participate in.** if you participate in special programs where khan academy partners with third parties, khan academy may share data collected from or about you with its third party partners to facilitate the program or services being offered. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, if you participate in khan academy's program with college board, khan academy may share information regarding your study habits, tests taken, and test scores with college board. [CLS] [SEP] these program partners may use your information we share with them as described in their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **we may share information with your consent.** khan academy does not share your personal information with third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent. [CLS] [SEP] in some instances, you may be able to grant us permission to share your personal information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with khan academy. [CLS] [SEP] in these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you may also choose to share content with others by email, or by posting khan academy content to social media sites such as facebook or twitter. [CLS] [SEP] these third parties may use your information as described in their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

##### we may share anonymous or aggregate data with others. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use data which has been de-identified and/or aggregated for product
development, research, analytics and other purposes, including for the purpose
of analyzing, improving, or marketing the khan academy services. [CLS] [SEP] in certain
occasions, khan academy may share this data with business partners to improve
our services or offerings. [CLS] [SEP] if we disclose information to authorized business
partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding
the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content,
services, promotions, and/or functionality on our service, such data will be
aggregated and/or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific
individual. [CLS] [SEP]

##### other instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or
business purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  
  

  *  **we will share data with employees and service providers.** khan academy may share information with our employees and trusted vendors, third party service providers and other individuals to provide services or products for us or on our behalf, which could include analytics, hosting, marketing and similar services. [CLS] [SEP] when we share personal information with third party service providers or vendors, these third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the security and confidentiality of that personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **we may share data in the context of a change of business, including a merger or acquisition.** in the event that khan academy is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred or disclosed in connection with such business transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if the transaction involves the transfer of student records to a third party, we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this privacy policy, or we will provide the school with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of student records by deleting student records before the transfer occurs. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **other instances.** khan academy may release personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of khan academy, our users, or the public; or (f) as required or permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] marketing and sponsored content

##### messages from khan academy

we may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services,
or other third party products and services we think you may enjoy. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in
your region we may send you an email notifying you of the partnership or
contest. [CLS] [SEP] we will not share your information with the third party unless you
opt-in to participate in the partnership or contest, and if so, the
information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your
participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize. [CLS] [SEP] you can
unsubscribe from these mailings at any time. [CLS] [SEP] see section 6 below. [CLS] [SEP]

##### sponsored content

khan academy does not display any third party advertisements on the service. [CLS] [SEP]
from time to time, we permit third parties to sponsor content displayed on our
service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, for-profit organizations may wish to sponsor all content
related to a particular educational topic, such as astronomy or biology. [CLS] [SEP]
sponsored content will always be labeled (e.g., “sponsored by ___”). [CLS] [SEP] khan
academy does not share any of our users' personal information with these
sponsors without explicit consent, and these sponsors do not have the ability
to track or collect information about our site visitors or users. [CLS] [SEP] as a non-
profit organization, khan academy relies on our sponsors, donors, and other
contributors to provide funding necessary to provide the free service to our
users. [CLS] [SEP]

please note: from time to time, we may display youtube video content created
by third parties and not by khan academy. [CLS] [SEP] while khan academy-created video
content does not display video advertisements, third party content may include
advertising which we cannot control. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] third parties and online advertising

##### interest based advertising

khan academy does not display any targeted advertising on our service. [CLS] [SEP]
however, we participate in interest-based advertising and use third party
advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements on other websites,
apps or services, including on facebook and other social networks, or on other
devices you may use. [CLS] [SEP] these third party ad networks use tracking technologies
to recognize your browser or device and to collect information about your
visit to our service to provide you customized content, advertising and
commercial messages which may be more relevant to your interests, as well as
to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution,
analytics and market research. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that we use our best efforts and take multiple steps to avoid the
collection of information for targeted advertising purposes when we believe
the service is being used by students or children under 13. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we
take steps to inhibit these third party advertising networks from collecting
information for targeted advertising purposes on webpages with child-directed
content or when a student or child user logs into the service. [CLS] [SEP]

to learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out
of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the network advertising
initiative’s online resources, at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>,
and/or the daa's resources at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. [CLS] [SEP] you may also
manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the eu-based your online
choices at <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to limit
interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by
selecting “limit ad tracking” (ios) or “opt-out of interest based ads”
(android). [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-
based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting
<http://youradchoices.com/appchoices> and downloading the mobile appchoices
app. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through
the nai's and daa's online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving
interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still
receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. [CLS] [SEP] you must perform the
opt-out on each browser or device you use. [CLS] [SEP]

##### youtube

khan academy uses youtube to display video content on the service. [CLS] [SEP] youtube
incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the youtube videos
embedded on the service, which may collect information from your browser when
you view the video on the service, including device identifiers and/or cookie
ids. [CLS] [SEP] this information is collected directly and automatically by youtube and
its partners, and khan academy does not participate in these data
transmissions. [CLS] [SEP] khan academy does not provide any personal information, such as
user names, to youtube. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent
we have controls over a third-party's practices. [CLS] [SEP] we have turned on “privacy-
enhanced mode” for youtube videos displayed on the service. [CLS] [SEP] we also utilize
google's “child-directed treatment” tags to alert google that these youtube
videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children or students. [CLS] [SEP] you can
learn more about google’s practices at
<http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to
control ad tracking through youtube by visiting the google ad settings page,
currently available at: <https://adssettings.google.com>. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] your choice and options relating to data collection and use

at khan academy, we use personal information as needed for the purposes for
which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of your personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] we take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information
we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. [CLS] [SEP] if you discover that
personal information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate,
incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact
us as outlined below. [CLS] [SEP]

##### you can choose to not provide us with personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

you may always decline to provide your personal information with khan academy. [CLS] [SEP]
registration is not required to access most of our online resources. [CLS] [SEP] if you
decline to register, however, khan academy will not be able to provide to you
certain features and functionalities found on our service. [CLS] [SEP] you may later
enable or access those features by providing khan academy with the necessary
personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] how to access, update, or delete your personal information

##### how to access or update your information. [CLS] [SEP]

we want you to have access to your information, so that you can help keep it
as accurate as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you register and provide khan academy with
personal information, you may update, correct, or delete your account and
information at any time by reviewing your profile information and preferences
on your account settings page. [CLS] [SEP]

parents can modify or delete child user accounts. [CLS] [SEP] parents who request to
modify or delete school user accounts may be directed to contact the school. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy will work with schools to provide parents access to information
in school user accounts at the request and direction of the school. [CLS] [SEP] if you
experience any difficulties in this process, please contact us as described
below. [CLS] [SEP]

##### how to delete your information. [CLS] [SEP]

to request deletion of your personal information at any time, please log into
your account and select ”delete your account“ through settings. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn
more in our help center, [here](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-
us/articles/202263014-how-can-i-cancel-or-delete-my-account-). [CLS] [SEP] please note
that your information will be retained in backup for up to one week. [CLS] [SEP] if you
log back into your account within 24 hours, your account will _not_ be deleted
and you will need to go through the deletion process again. [CLS] [SEP]

we may not be able to delete data in all instances, such as information
retained in technical support logs and other business records. [CLS] [SEP] we will not be
required to delete any information which has been de-identified or
disassociated with personal identifiers such that it can no longer be used to
reasonably identify a particular individual. [CLS] [SEP]

unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as
long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for operational
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may retain certain data as necessary to prevent
fraud or future abuse, for recordkeeping or other legitimate business
purposes, or if required by law. [CLS] [SEP] we may also retain information which has been
de-identified or aggregated such that it can no longer reasonably identify a
particular individual. [CLS] [SEP] all retained personal information will remain subject
to the terms of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] our approach to data security

##### data security is important to you, and to us. [CLS] [SEP]

to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your
identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your
information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may ask you to provide certain personal
information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and
use a password to access certain parts of our service. [CLS] [SEP] you should create and
maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account. [CLS] [SEP]

##### we try to ensure that our service and information sent to us are safe,
but no security measures are perfect. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information
and other information we maintain in connection with our service. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot,
however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you
transmit to khan academy, and you do so at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] once we receive your
transmission of information, khan academy makes commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure the security of our systems. [CLS] [SEP] when you enter sensitive
information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure
socket layer technology (ssl) or similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] however, please note
that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,
or managerial safeguards. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that any information under our control
is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable
steps to investigate the situation and will notify you of the security
incident in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] school users and student records

khan academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free,
educational content. [CLS] [SEP] we strive to implement best practices to protect the
privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike. [CLS] [SEP] to help our school
partners address their obligations to protect their students' data privacy, we
have implemented additional controls and procedures for schools, school
districts and teachers (collectively referred to as “ **schools** ”) when they
enter into a contract with khan academy to use the service as part of the
school's educational curriculum. [CLS] [SEP] when the service is used as part of the
school's educational curriculum, the personal information related to the
school's student users (“ **school users** ”) that is (i) provided to khan
academy by a student or by a school, or (ii) collected by khan academy during
the provision of the service to a school, may include information defined as
“educational records” by the family educational rights and privacy act (“
**ferpa** ”) or other information protected by similar student data privacy
laws. [CLS] [SEP] we call this information “ **student records.** ”

please note, because many of our user accounts are used for both school and
non-school purposes, only personal information relating to user accounts which
are (1) created by a school (for example, when a teacher creates the user
name, login and password to establish school user accounts, or when the
teacher rosters a class using google classroom, clever, or similar single
sign-on service), or (2) created by a school user at the direction of a
school, using a school email address and associated with a school's class on
the service, and (3) created pursuant to a contract between khan academy and
the school, are designated as student records on khan academy. [CLS] [SEP] student records
shall not include information a student or other individual may provide to
khan academy independent of the student's use of the service at the direction
of the school. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if a user connects her existing khan academy
account (i.e., an account associated with a non-school email address and
created outside of her use of the service for the school's purposes) to a
school’s class on the service, the personal information and profile data
associated with the account shall not be considered student records. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are a school, please contact us at
[schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org](mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org)
to learn more about how to create school user accounts which may hold student
records. [CLS] [SEP]

 **our commitment:** we are proud supporters of the student privacy pledge. [CLS] [SEP]
our collection and use of student records is governed by our contracts with
the schools, by our privacy policy, and by applicable privacy laws. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we work with schools to help protect personal information from the
student’s educational record, as required by the family educational rights and
privacy act (“ **ferpa** ”), and to protect the personal information of
students under 13 consistent with the children’s online privacy protection act
(“ **coppa** ”). [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or
deleting the personal information of a school user accessing the service
through a school partner agreement, please contact your school directly. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we collect, maintain, use and share student records only for an authorized educational and as described in our privacy policy, or as directed by the school, the school user and/or the student's parent or legal guardian (a “ **parent** ”). [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not disclose student records for targeted advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] while we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services, we disable third party ad networks when a school user logs into a school user account on the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not build a personal profile of a school user other than in furtherance of an educational purpose or as authorized by a parent. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of student records maintained by the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we will never sell student records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this privacy policy or we will provide the school with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of student records by deleting the student records before the transfer occurs. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we will not make any material changes to our privacy policy or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of student records without first giving notice to the school and providing a choice before the student records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected. [CLS] [SEP]

##### how we share and disclose student records. [CLS] [SEP]

we disclose student records in the manner described in our privacy policy
under section entitled how we share and disclose information. [CLS] [SEP] depending on the
features and account controls applicable to the school user accounts, we may
share usernames and profile information with other users on the service, such
as teachers, coaches, or school administrators, and this information may be
visible if a school user posts content in the discussion forums. [CLS] [SEP]

depending on the manner in which khan academy is used by a school and the
terms of the agreement between the school and khan academy, khan academy may
provide access to certain student records, school user account usage data (“
**school analytics** ”) and teacher user account usage data to the school for
the purpose of monitoring student usage and activity and evaluating the
effectiveness of the school's use of the khan academy service. [CLS] [SEP] in some
circumstances, school analytics may only be available for student accounts
using a school email address or login and which are associated with a school’s
teacher or coach. [CLS] [SEP]

##### how we retain and delete student records. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not knowingly retain student records beyond the time period required
to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by a school, student or
parent. [CLS] [SEP] many of our users continue to use their accounts for a personal, non-
school purpose and may associate their accounts with the account of their
parent. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, the user (or the user's parent) shall be responsible
for account deletion requests. [CLS] [SEP]

all users, including school users (or their parents) can delete their accounts
and all personal information associated with the account at any time through
account settings. [CLS] [SEP] see “[how can i cancel or delete my
account](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202263014-how-can-
i-cancel-or-delete-my-account-)” in the khan academy help center for
instructions. [CLS] [SEP]

the school is responsible for managing student records which the school no
longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request when
such data is no longer needed. [CLS] [SEP] schools should contact us at
[schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org](mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org)
to request deletion of student records associated with the school's use of
khan academy. [CLS] [SEP] please note that khan academy cannot comply with a school's
request to delete personal information in a user account except for school
user accounts created by a school (i.e., using a school email address and/or
an account login provided by a school) pursuant to a contractual agreement
between the school and khan academy, or unless the user (or the user's parent)
requests deletion directly. [CLS] [SEP] we will also not be able to delete information
associated with school user accounts that the school user has associated with
a personal account. [CLS] [SEP]

##### questions about student records. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have questions about specific practices relating to student records
provided to khan academy by a school, please direct your questions to your
school. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] how does khan academy protect children's privacy?

khan academy does not permit children under the age of 13 (a “child” or
“children”) to create an account without the consent and at the direction of a
parent or school. [CLS] [SEP] please contact us at
[privacy@khanacademy.org](mailto:privacy@khanacademy.org) if you believe we
have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without
parental consent so that we may delete the information as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

children under 13 may create an account with the parent's consent. [CLS] [SEP] please see
the **children 's privacy policy** to learn more about how khan academy
collects, uses and shares information associated with child accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

when khan academy is used by a school in an educational setting, we may rely
on the school to provide the requisite consent for khan academy to collect
information from a school user under the age of 13, in lieu of parental
consent. [CLS] [SEP]

# khan academy children's privacy policy

##### khan academy is committed to children’s privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

protecting the privacy of children is especially important to khan academy. [CLS] [SEP]
for that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal
information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (“ **child
users** ”). [CLS] [SEP] khan academy does not knowingly permit child users to register
directly for our service without consent of a parent or school. [CLS] [SEP] if khan
academy learns that personal information of a child user has been collected on
our service without parental consent, then khan academy will take appropriate
steps to delete this information. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a parent or guardian (“
**parent** ”) and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a
registered account with our service without your consent, please alert khan
academy at [privacy@khanacademy.org](mailto:privacy@khanacademy.org) and
request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems. [CLS] [SEP]

##### how children may register for and use our service. [CLS] [SEP]

child users can sign up for a khan academy account several ways. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] when a child user signs up for a khan academy account we request
parental consent. [CLS] [SEP]

when a child user registers for our service, we request a birthdate, username,
password, and a parent's email address so that we can email the child user's
parent in order to seek consent for the child to use the service. [CLS] [SEP] khan academy
does not ask the child user for any more information than is necessary to
provide the service to the child user or to seek parental consent. [CLS] [SEP] the child
user is permitted to use the service for seven (7) days through a restricted
account (see below) while we notify the parent for consent. [CLS] [SEP] if we do not
receive parental consent within 7 days, the child user's restricted account is
closed, and the child's personal information is deleted from our systems. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] when a child user account is created by a school, the school may
provide consent. [CLS] [SEP]

when the khan academy service is used by a teacher, school, or district (a “
**school** ”) in the classroom for an educational purpose, we permit the
school to create child user accounts and to provide the requisite consent for
khan academy to collect personal information of a child user for this purpose,
in lieu of parental consent. [CLS] [SEP] schools may create a child user account by adding
students to the service through google classroom, clever, or similar single
sign-on service, or through a school integration mechanism, or a school may
create logins/passwords for each individual student. [CLS] [SEP] when schools create
accounts in this manner, we do not request additional consent from the parent. [CLS] [SEP]
however, when a school or other individual invites a child user to join the
service and connect to a teacher or coach's class using a class code, we
request parental consent in the manner described below. [CLS] [SEP]

##### methods for providing parental consent. [CLS] [SEP]

parents may provide consent for a child user to use the service through a
restricted account (explained below) by responding affirmatively to an email
sent by khan academy to the parent's email address provided by the child user
during registration. [CLS] [SEP] if we do not receive consent from the parent within seven
(7) days, the child user's account will be closed and the child's personal
information is deleted from our systems. [CLS] [SEP] restricted accounts may access and
use certain features of the service in a limited manner. [CLS] [SEP]

to enable additional functionality for the child user account and to enable
full access and control over the child user's account activity, the parent
must create a parent account on the service and connect to the child user's
account by clicking on the account creation link in the parental consent
notice. [CLS] [SEP] parent accounts control the settings and functionality of the child
account. [CLS] [SEP] the parent can maintain the child's restricted account, and/or can
enable additional functionality and data sharing features, if desired. [CLS] [SEP] parents
can revoke a child user's permissions to use the service at any time by
deleting the account. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] restricted accounts for child users. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy attempts to restrict a child user's access to certain features
that could result in disclosure of the child's personal information. [CLS] [SEP] a
restricted account limits sharing and displaying private information about the
child user in various ways. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, a child user with a restricted account cannot:

  * display personal information other than a username. [CLS] [SEP] restricted accounts contain the child's username and do not include other personal information or profile data. [CLS] [SEP] because the username may be displayed on the service, we strongly recommend selecting a username which does not relate to or identify the real name of the child. [CLS] [SEP] the child username can be selected or revised by the parent by creating a parent account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * add or edit personal information associated with a restricted account
  * post to public discussion forums, or post questions or answers on lessons
  * see or access links to third-party sites on the service
  * receive emails from khan academy (all emails are sent to the parent email on file)
  * communicate with or share personal information with coaches other than a username and service usage activity (i.e., lessons completed, badges earned, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] similarly, coaches cannot communicate with a child user with a restricted account except to assign content for the child user to view through the class. [CLS] [SEP]

a parent who creates a parent account can manage and control additional
features and functionality. [CLS] [SEP] for example, parents can create or revise a
child's username; add or revise profile information; restrict or enable the
child user to add a coach using a class code. [CLS] [SEP] please see “[how are child
accounts different from regular
accounts](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202262974-how-are-
child-accounts-different-from-regular-accounts-)” in the help center to learn
more. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] what information do we collect from a child user?

we collect a username, birthdate, and parent's email address when a child user
registers for the service, as well as any other personal information a parent
adds to a child user's account, as described above. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information
about the child user's use of the service (lessons completed, badges earned)
as well as content the child posts to the service if such functionality is
enabled by the parent. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect usage and device information, as
described in our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to provide the
service to the child user and for the purposes described in in our privacy
policy's section “how we use the information we collect.” we use the parent's
email address to communicate messages about the account. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] how do we disclose information relating to a child user?

as described above, restricted accounts have limited data sharing
capabilities. [CLS] [SEP] a username and progress information, along with any personal
information the parent added to the child's profile, is shared with a coach or
teacher added to the child user's account, though a parent account may
restrict the child user from adding coaches to the account. [CLS] [SEP] parents may also
enable additional data sharing features through a parent account, for example,
by adding profile information and permitting the profile to be shared with
coaches and other users, or enabling the child user to post content (e.g.,
questions and answers) to the service. [CLS] [SEP] parents that enable content-posting
features should be aware that a child user could post personally identifiable
information in free-form content on the service, and should monitor the child
user's posts and delete personal information if needed. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose
personal information of child users for business purposes, as described in the
privacy policy section “other instances where we may share or disclose
information for legal or business purposes.”

##### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] third party tracking and online advertising. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy does not display any targeted advertising on the service. [CLS] [SEP] we do
not disclose personal information of child users for direct marketing purposes
or for targeted advertising purposes. [CLS] [SEP] while we do permit third party
advertising partners to operate on our service for the purpose of retargeting,
analytics and attribution services (see our privacy policy section “third
parties and online advertising”), we take steps to disable third party ad
networks on webpages with child-directed content or when a child user logs
into a restricted account on the service. [CLS] [SEP]

##### youtube

khan academy uses youtube to display video content on the service. [CLS] [SEP] youtube
incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the youtube videos
embedded on the service, which may collect information from your browser when
you view the video on the service, including device identifiers and/or cookie
ids. [CLS] [SEP] this information is collected directly and automatically by youtube and
its partners, and khan academy does not participate in these data
transmissions. [CLS] [SEP] khan academy does not provide any personal information, such as
usernames, to youtube. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent
we have controls over a third-party's practices. [CLS] [SEP] we have turned on “privacy-
enhanced mode” for youtube videos displayed on the service. [CLS] [SEP] we also utilize
google's “child-directed treatment” tags to alert google that these youtube
videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP]
you can learn more about google's practices at
<http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>. [CLS] [SEP] you may also be able to
control ad tracking through youtube by visiting the google ad settings page,
currently available at: <https://adssettings.google.com>. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] how to access, modify and delete your child's personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

as a parent, you have the ability to access control information about your
child user in the “your children” section of your parent account. [CLS] [SEP] to refuse
future collection or use of your child's personal information, you can delete
your child user's account by following the instructions in our
[faq](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202263014). [CLS] [SEP] please
note, you must delete your child user’s account __before__ you delete the
parent account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not have a parent account associated with your child user's
restricted account, you may contact us at <http://khan.co/ka-support> to
access or delete the child user's account. [CLS] [SEP] please note you will need the child
user's username, and we may take steps to authenticate your identity before we
can provide access to the restricted account. [CLS] [SEP]

our mission is to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]

khan academy is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. [CLS] [SEP] [donate](/donate) or
