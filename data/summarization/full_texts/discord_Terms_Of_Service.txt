that any content, information, or communication on the services is infringing
upon a copyright, you may be held liable for damages and attorneysâ fees. [CLS] [SEP]

_counter-notice_. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that your content that was removed (or to
which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the
authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright ownerâs agent, or
pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your content, you may
send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the
copyright agent:

  * your physical or electronic signature;
  * identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

if a counter-notice is received by the copyright agent, the company will send
a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that
person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10
business days. [CLS] [SEP] unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

law, the company has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate
circumstances and at the company's sole discretion, users who are deemed to be
repeat infringers. [CLS] [SEP] the company may also at its sole discretion limit access to
the service and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any

infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). [CLS] [SEP]

screen in the discord desktop or mobile app and follow the instructions for
cancellation. [CLS] [SEP]

most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] in the event
of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] this notice must
provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and
the contact information of the party giving it. [CLS] [SEP] you must send any such notice
to discord by email to [disputes@discord.com](mailto:disputes@discord.com) and
by u.s. [CLS] [SEP] mail to discord inc., 444 de haro street #200, san francisco, ca
94107. [CLS] [SEP]

the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and
good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a
lawsuit or arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral
rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use
of the site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith
negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of
disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute
informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be
held in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] state in which you reside. [CLS] [SEP] for residents outside the united
states, arbitration shall be initiated in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP] discord
and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or
federal court in san francisco, california to compel arbitration, stay
proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the
rules of jams that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated
(referred to as the âjams rulesâ) and under the rules set forth in these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a conflict between the jams rules and the rules set forth
in these terms, the rules set forth in these terms will govern. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration
means that you waive your right to a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] you may, in arbitration, seek
any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your stateâs
law. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a
lawsuit, discord will pay the additional cost. [CLS] [SEP] discord shall also bear the
cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims,
defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an
improper purpose or frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all other additional
costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation,
attorneyâs fees and expert witness costs unless discord is specifically
required to pay such fees under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] the decision of the arbitrator
will be in writing and binding and conclusive on discord and you, and judgment
to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]
discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation
motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator must follow these terms of service and can award
the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other
equitable relief and attorneyâs fees. [CLS] [SEP] discord and you understand that,
absent this mandatory arbitration provision, discord and you would have the
right to sue in court and have a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] discord and you further
understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the
costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in
arbitration than in court. [CLS] [SEP]

if discordâs or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less
and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party
bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be
conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the
jams rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

you or discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where
jurisdiction and venue over you and discord otherwise qualifies for such small
claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of
equitable relief. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims
court, you agree to still provide discord with advance notice by email to
[disputes@discord.com](mailto:disputes@discord.com) and by u.s. [CLS] [SEP] mail to
discord inc., 444 de haro street #200, san francisco, ca 94107. [CLS] [SEP]

_opt-out right_. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to opt out and not be bound by the
provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to
opt out to discord by email to [arbitration-opt-
out@discord.com](mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com). [CLS] [SEP] the notice must be
sent within 90 days of this terms of service taking effect, or your account
creation on the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not opt out via this method, you will be
bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. [CLS] [SEP]
if you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, discord will not be
bound by them either. [CLS] [SEP] if any clause within this arbitration section is found
to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this
section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and
effect. [CLS] [SEP]

_survival_. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration section shall survive any termination of your
account or the service. [CLS] [SEP]

# class waiver

this section and the previous section only applies to you if you are a united
states resident. [CLS] [SEP]

please read this section carefully. [CLS] [SEP] it may significantly affect your legal
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and
not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or
representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

the arbitrator cannot combine more than one personâs or entityâs claims
into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or
representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). [CLS] [SEP] and, the arbitratorâs
decision or award in one personâs or entityâs case can only impact the
person or entity that brought the claim, not other discord customers, and
cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers. [CLS] [SEP]

if any court or arbitrator determines that the
class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is
void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a
class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims, or
controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in
federal court located in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP]

this class action waiver section shall survive any termination of your account
or the services. [CLS] [SEP]

applicable data, if any, is subject to united states export controls. [CLS] [SEP] no

  * you agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our ios app (e.g., you must not be in violation of your wireless data service terms of agreement when using the ios app). [CLS] [SEP]
  * the parties agree that apple and appleâs subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these terms as they relate to your license of the companyâs ios app. [CLS] [SEP] upon your acceptance of these terms, apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as they relate to your license of the ios app as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

# general

_governing law_. [CLS] [SEP] by visiting or using the service, you agree that the laws of
the united states and the state of california, without regard to principles of
conflict of laws and regardless of your location, will govern these terms and
any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the company. [CLS] [SEP]

any claim or dispute between you and the company that arises out of or is
related to the service and is not subject to arbitration shall be decided
exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in san francisco
county, california, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack
of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of san francisco county,
california. [CLS] [SEP]

_injunctive and other equitable relief_. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that the rights
granted and obligations made to the company under these terms are of a unique
and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and
irreparable harm to the company for which remedies at law are inadequate. [CLS] [SEP] the
company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any
breach or anticipatory breach by you. [CLS] [SEP] you irrevocably waive all rights to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief. [CLS] [SEP]

_entire agreement_. [CLS] [SEP] these terms constitute the entire agreement between you
and the company with respect to your use of the service and any other subject
matter hereof and cannot be changed or modified by you except as expressly
posted on the service by the company. [CLS] [SEP] you also may be subject to additional
terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party
services, third party content or third party software. [CLS] [SEP]

_waiver_. [CLS] [SEP] the failure of the company to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or
default. [CLS] [SEP]

_severability_. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of these terms is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected
in the provision, and the other provisions of these terms shall remain in full
force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

_course of conduct/trade practice_. [CLS] [SEP] neither the course of conduct between the
parties nor trade practice will act to modify these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

_assignment_. [CLS] [SEP] these terms may not be assigned by you without the company's
prior written consent, but are freely assignable by the company. [CLS] [SEP] subject to
the foregoing restriction, these terms will be binding on, inure to, and
enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. [CLS] [SEP]

_documentation of compliance_. [CLS] [SEP] upon the company's request, you will furnish
the company with any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to
verify your compliance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

_interpretation_. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that these terms will not be construed against the
company by virtue of having drafted them. [CLS] [SEP]

_defenses based on electronic form of these terms_. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby waive any and
all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these terms and the
lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

_survival_. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the provisions of these terms that by their nature
should survive termination will survive any termination of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
