# discord privacy policy

last updated and effective: june 23, 2020

# welcome to discord!

discord, inc. [CLS] [SEP] provides a social online and mobile chat platform via the
discord website (the âsiteâ), the discord application (the âappâ) and
related internet services (collectively, the âservice(s)â). [CLS] [SEP] the service is
operated by discord, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (the âcompanyâ, âweâ or âusâ) for users
of the service (âyouâ). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy sets forth our policy with
respect to information that is collected from visitors to the site and users
of the app and/or the services. [CLS] [SEP] under applicable law, discord, inc. [CLS] [SEP] is the
âdata controllerâ of personal data collected through the services. [CLS] [SEP]

# information we collect

when you interact with us through the services, we may collect information
from you, as further described below:

 **information you provide** : we collect information from you when you
voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to
the services or use certain services. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect may include but
not be limited to username, email address, and any messages, images, transient
voip data (to enable communication delivery only) or other content you send
via the chat feature. [CLS] [SEP]

## other information:

  *  **data we collect automatically** : when you interact with us through the services, we receive and store certain information such as an ip address, device id, and your activities within the services. [CLS] [SEP] we may store such information or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by affiliates, agents or service providers. [CLS] [SEP] the services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our site, the number of messages users have sent, as well as the sites which refer visitors to discord. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **aggregated information** : in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected. [CLS] [SEP] this research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **info through other services** : you may give us permission to collect your information in other services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you may connect a social networking service ("sns") such as facebook or twitter to your discord account. [CLS] [SEP] when you do this, it allows us to obtain information from those accounts (for example, your friends or contacts). [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **cookies** : we employ cookies and similar technologies to keep track of your local computerâs settings such as which account you have logged into and notification settings. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read on future visits. [CLS] [SEP] we may expand our use of cookies to save additional data as new features are added to the service. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we use technologies such as web beacons and single-pixel gifs to record log data such as open rates for emails sent by the system. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we may use third party web site analytic tools such as google analytics on our website that employ cookies to collect certain information concerning your use of our services. [CLS] [SEP] however, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] further information about the procedure to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your internet browser provider's website via your help screen. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **advertisements** : you may see our service advertised in other applications or websites. [CLS] [SEP] after clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our service, you will become a user of the service. [CLS] [SEP] advertising platforms, which include twitter and facebook (and whose sdks are integrated within our service), may collect information for optimizing advertising campaigns outside of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by
third parties outside of the discord service, you may be able to exercise that
choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties,
including the network advertising initiative (nai), the digital advertising
alliance (daa). [CLS] [SEP] our services currently do not respond to âdo not trackâ
(dnt) signals and operate as described in this privacy policy whether or not a
dnt signal is received, as there is no consistent industry standard for
compliance. [CLS] [SEP]

# where information is processed

the company is based in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] no matter where you are located,
you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to
the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and other countries. [CLS] [SEP] the laws of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] and other countries
governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as
the laws of the country where you live. [CLS] [SEP]

# our use of your information

we use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide information for a certain reason, we may use
the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. [CLS] [SEP] for
instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide
to answer your question or resolve your problem. [CLS] [SEP] also, if you provide
information in order to obtain access to the services, we will use your
information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your
use of such services. [CLS] [SEP] the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the
ârelated companiesâ) may also use your information collected through the
services to help us improve the content and functionality of the services, to
better understand our users and to improve the services. [CLS] [SEP] the company and its
affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you
about services we believe will be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] if we do so, each
marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you
to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if at
any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you
wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as
indicated below. [CLS] [SEP]

# our legal bases for handling of your personal data

the laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal
ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent those
laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:

  * to honor our contractual commitments to you: much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at usersâ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our services. [CLS] [SEP]

    * legitimate interests: in many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals: this includes:

    * providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;

      * customer service;

      * marketing, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] sending emails or other communications to let you know about new features;

      * protecting our users, personnel, and property;

      * analyzing and improving our business, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] collecting information about how you use our services to optimize the design and placement of certain features;

      * processing job applications;

      * managing legal issues. [CLS] [SEP]

      * legal compliance: we need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

      * to protect the vital interests of the individual or others: for example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent medical situation. [CLS] [SEP]

    * consent: where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. [CLS] [SEP]

# our disclosure of your information

the company is not in the business of selling your information. [CLS] [SEP] we consider
this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. [CLS] [SEP] there are,
however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with
certain third parties, as set forth below:

  *  **business transfers** : as we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **consent** : we may transfer your information with your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **related companies** : we may also share your information with our related companies for purposes consistent with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **developers** : developers using our sdk or api will have access to their end usersâ information, including message content, message metadata, and voice metadata. [CLS] [SEP] developers must use such information only to provide the sdk/api functionality within their applications and/or services. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **agents, consultants and related third parties** : like many businesses, we sometimes hire other companies or individuals to perform certain business-related functions. [CLS] [SEP] examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **legal requirements** : we may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the company or related companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **aggregated or non-identifiable data** : we may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

# unsolicited information

you may provide us with ideas for new products or modifications to existing
products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, âunsolicited
informationâ). [CLS] [SEP] all unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-
confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute
such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution. [CLS] [SEP]

# children

our services are for users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect
personal information from children under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a parent or
guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed
personal information to us please contact us at
[dis.gd/request](https://dis.gd/request) and select "parent of a user" as your
report type option. [CLS] [SEP] note: in some countries, the age of digital consent is
[older than 13](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612). [CLS] [SEP]
if you are in those countries, you must be at least that age to use the
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, for residents of the eea, where processing of personal
information is based on consent, discord will not knowingly engage in that
processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data
protection law. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such
users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to
promptly remove applicable information from our records. [CLS] [SEP]

# links to other web sites

this privacy policy applies only to the services. [CLS] [SEP] the services may contain
links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the âthird party
sitesâ). [CLS] [SEP] the policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the
third party sites. [CLS] [SEP] the links from the services do not imply that we endorse or
have reviewed the third party sites. [CLS] [SEP] we suggest contacting those sites
directly for information on their privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

# data retention

we generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the
purposes identified herein. [CLS] [SEP] to dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it,
delete it or take other appropriate steps. [CLS] [SEP] data may persist in copies made for
backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. [CLS] [SEP]

# security

we take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the services
from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
destruction. [CLS] [SEP] however, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure
or error free. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, email sent to or from the services may not be
secure. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information
you send to us via email. [CLS] [SEP] please keep this in mind when disclosing any
information via the internet. [CLS] [SEP]

# your data rights and choices

we believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and
so we are making the following options to control your data available to all
users, regardless of their location. [CLS] [SEP]

you can update certain information by accessing your profile via
âsettings.â you can also unsubscribe from certain emails by clicking the
âunsubscribeâ link they contain. [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out from certain cookie-
related processing by following the instructions above in âother
information.â

individuals in california, the european economic area, canada, costa rica and
some other jurisdictions outside the united states have certain legal rights
to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access
personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form),
and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate
circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] they may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal
data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent,
though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. [CLS] [SEP] they also will
not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **how can i access the personal data you have about me?**

if you would like to submit a data access request, you can do so from the
âsettingsâ page of the services, where there is a button to download your
data. [CLS] [SEP] we will then start the process and provide you a link to access the
personal data that discord has on you within 30 days. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **how do i correct, update, amend, or delete the personal data you have about me?**

in addition to the functionality available through the âsettingsâ of the
services, in which you can correct, update, amend, or delete certain personal
data, you can also request other modifications from us directly. [CLS] [SEP] please write
us at [privacy@discord.com](mailto:privacy@discord.com) with the words
âpersonal data requestâ in the subject or body of your message, along with
an explanation of what data subject right you are seeking to exercise. [CLS] [SEP] for
your protection, we may take steps to verify identity before responding to
your request. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  **how do i object or restrict the manner in which discord processes my personal data?**

you have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal
data in certain circumstancesâfor example, if we have no lawful basis to
keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate. [CLS] [SEP]

discord offers you the ability to restrict the processing of your data for
specific uses, which you can find in the âsettingsâ page of the services. [CLS] [SEP]
individuals in the european economic area have the right to opt out of all of
our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP] to
exercise this right, please see the âsettingsâ page for your account. [CLS] [SEP] you
may also click the âunsubscribeâ link in any of our marketing emails. [CLS] [SEP]

the rights and options described above are subject to limitations and
exceptions under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to those rights, you have the
right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. [CLS] [SEP] however,
we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve
your concern. [CLS] [SEP]
