hello, and welcome to the spotify terms and conditions of use ("terms"). [CLS] [SEP] the
terms you see below are important because they:

  * outline your legal rights on spotify
  * explain the rights you give to us when you use spotify
  * describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using spotify
  * contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration

please read these terms, our [privacy
policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/) and any other terms
referenced in this document carefully. [CLS] [SEP] we hope you're sitting comfortably and
listening to some great music. [CLS] [SEP]  
here we go... [CLS] [SEP]

## 1 introduction

thanks for choosing spotify ("spotify," "we," "us," "our"). [CLS] [SEP] spotify provides
personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music
and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed
from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] by signing up or otherwise using any of these spotify
services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and
user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated
with our services (collectively, the "spotify service" or "service"), or
accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made
available through the service (the "content") you are entering into a binding
contract with spotify usa inc. [CLS] [SEP]

your agreement with us includes these terms and any additional terms that you
agree to, as discussed in the entire agreement section below, other than terms
with any third parties (collectively, the "agreements"). [CLS] [SEP] the agreements
include terms regarding future changes to the agreements, export controls,
automatic renewals, limitations of liability,
[privacy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy), waiver of class
actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. [CLS] [SEP] if you
wish to review the terms of the agreements, the current effective version of
the agreements can be found on spotify's website. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that you
have read and understood the agreements, accept these agreements, and agree to
be bound by them. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't agree with (or cannot comply with) the
agreements, then you may not use the spotify service or access any content. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to use the spotify service and access any content, you need to (1) be
18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian's
consent to the agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with
us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside
in the united states. [CLS] [SEP] you also promise that any registration information that
you submit to spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep
it that way at all times. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2 changes to the agreements

occasionally we may make changes to the agreements. [CLS] [SEP] when we make material
changes to the agreements, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate under
the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the service
or by sending you an email. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, we will notify you in advance, and
your continued use of the service after the changes have been made will
constitute your acceptance of the changes. [CLS] [SEP] please therefore make sure you read
any such notice carefully. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to continue using the service
under the new version of the agreements, you may terminate your account by
[contacting us](https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/). [CLS] [SEP] if you
received a trial or a paid subscription through a third party, you must cancel
the applicable paid subscription through such third party. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3 enjoying spotify

here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy spotify. [CLS] [SEP]

### 3.1 service options

you can find a description of our service options on
[our](https://www.spotify.com/) website, and we will explain which service
options are available to you when you create a spotify account. [CLS] [SEP] certain
options are provided to you free-of-charge. [CLS] [SEP] the spotify service that does not
require payment is currently referred to as the "free service." other options
require payment before you can access them (the "paid subscriptions"). [CLS] [SEP] we may
also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including
offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through
the spotify service. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the products and services
provided by such third parties. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to modify, terminate or
otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at
any time in accordance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

the unlimited service may not be available to all users. [CLS] [SEP] we will explain which
services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you
cancel your subscription to the unlimited service, or if your subscription to
the unlimited service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment
details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the unlimited service. [CLS] [SEP] note
that the unlimited service may be discontinued in the future, in which case
you will no longer be charged for the service. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other
offer provided or sold by or on behalf of spotify for access to a paid
subscription ("code"), separate terms and conditions presented to you along
with the code may also apply to your access to the service and you agree to
comply with any such terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] you may also purchase access to a
paid subscription through a third party. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, separate terms and
conditions with such third party in addition to the agreements may apply to
your access to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### 3.2 trials

from time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of paid
subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a
"trial"). [CLS] [SEP] spotify may determine your eligibility for a trial, and withdraw or
modify a trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the
extent permitted under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

for some trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start
the trial. [CLS] [SEP] by providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin
charging you for the paid subscription on the first day following the end of
the trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to
you in advance. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want this charge, you must cancel the applicable
paid subscription before the end of the trial by [clicking
here](https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/) if you signed up
for the trial through spotify, or if you received your trial through a third
party, you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through the third
party. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4 payments and cancellations

### 4.1 billing

you may purchase a paid subscription directly from spotify or through a third
party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or
some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2)
pre-payment giving you access to the spotify service for a specific time
period ("pre-paid period"). [CLS] [SEP]

spotify may change the price for the paid subscriptions, including recurring
subscription fees, the pre-paid period (for periods not yet paid), or codes,
from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance
and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. [CLS] [SEP] price changes will take
effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the
price change. [CLS] [SEP] subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by
continuing to use the spotify service after the price change takes effect. [CLS] [SEP] if
you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change
by unsubscribing from the paid subscription prior to the price change going
into effect. [CLS] [SEP]

### 4.2 renewal; cancellation

unless your paid subscription has been purchased for a pre-paid period, your
payment to spotify or the third party through which you purchased the paid
subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable
subscription period, unless you cancel your paid subscription before the end
of the then-current subscription period by [clicking
here](https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/) if you purchased
the paid subscription through spotify, or if you purchased the paid
subscription through a third party, by canceling the paid subscription through
such third party. [CLS] [SEP] the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day
of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free
service. [CLS] [SEP] we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription
periods. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have purchased a paid subscription using a code, your subscription will
automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the code, or when
there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
purchased your paid subscription through a third party, you must cancel
directly with that third party. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5 using our service

the spotify service and the content are the property of spotify or spotify's
licensors. [CLS] [SEP] we grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make

this access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or

content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not
redistribute or transfer the spotify service or the content. [CLS] [SEP]

the spotify software applications and the content are not sold or transferred
to you, and spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the
spotify software applications and content even after installation on your
personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers
and/or other devices ("devices"). [CLS] [SEP]

all spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and
any other features of the spotify brand ("spotify brand features") are the
sole property of spotify or its licensors. [CLS] [SEP] the agreements do not grant you any
rights to use any spotify brand features whether for commercial or non-
commercial use. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to abide by our user guidelines and not to use the spotify service,
the content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the
agreements. [CLS] [SEP] except for the rights expressly granted to you in the agreements,
spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the spotify service or
content. [CLS] [SEP]

third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in
the spotify service are made available to you under the relevant third party
software library's license terms as published in the help or settings section
of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6 third party applications and devices

the spotify service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third
party applications, websites, and services ("third party applications") and
third party devices to make the spotify service available to you. [CLS] [SEP] these third
party applications and devices may have their own terms and conditions of use
and privacy policies and your use of these third party applications and
devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and
privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that spotify does not endorse and
is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any
third party application or device or for any transaction you may enter into
with the provider of any such third party applications and devices, nor does
spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the third
party applications and devices with the service. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7 user-generated content

spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the service
(which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information,
playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content)
("user content"). [CLS] [SEP] for the avoidance of doubt, "user content" includes any such
content posted to the spotify support community as well as any other part of
the spotify service. [CLS] [SEP]

you promise that, with respect to any user content you post on spotify, (1)
you own or have the right to post such user content, and (2) such user
content, or its use by spotify as contemplated by the agreements, does not
violate the agreements or any other rights set forth within the user
guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity,

endorsement of you or your user content by spotify or any artist, band, label,
entity or individual without express written consent from spotify or such
individual or entity. [CLS] [SEP]

spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit user content. [CLS] [SEP]
in all cases, spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any
user content for any or no reason, including user content that, in spotify's
sole discretion, violates the agreements. [CLS] [SEP] spotify may take these actions
without prior notification to you or any third party. [CLS] [SEP] removal or disabling of
access to user content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise
to remove or disable access to any specific user content. [CLS] [SEP]

you are solely responsible for all user content that you post. [CLS] [SEP] spotify is not
responsible for user content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any
user content. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that if anyone brings a claim against spotify related
to user content that you post, then, to the extent permissible under local
law, you will indemnify and hold spotify harmless from and against all
damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees
and costs) arising out of such claim. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8 rights you grant us

in consideration for the rights granted to you under the agreements, you grant
us the right (1) to allow the spotify service to use the processor, bandwidth,
and storage hardware on your device in order to facilitate the operation of
the service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3)
to allow our business partners to do the same. [CLS] [SEP] in any part of the spotify
service, the content you access, including its selection and placement, may be
influenced by commercial considerations, including spotify's agreements with
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] some content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise
made available by spotify (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] podcasts) may contain advertising as part of
the content. [CLS] [SEP] the spotify service makes such content available to you
unmodified. [CLS] [SEP]

if you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to spotify in connection with
the spotify service or content ("feedback"), you acknowledge that the feedback
is not confidential and you authorize spotify to use that feedback without
restriction and without payment to you. [CLS] [SEP] feedback is considered a type of user
content. [CLS] [SEP]

you grant spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make
available to the public (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] perform or display), publish, translate, modify,
create derivative works from, and distribute any of your user content in
connection with the service through any medium, whether alone or in
combination with other content or materials, in any manner and by any means,
method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created. [CLS] [SEP] aside from the
rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights,
including intellectual property rights, in the user content. [CLS] [SEP] where applicable
and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce
any "moral rights" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified
as the author of any user content, including feedback, and your right to
object to derogatory treatment of such user content. [CLS] [SEP]

see [spotify's copyright policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/copyright-
policy) if spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided
by spotify, that any content infringes a copyright, spotify may in its sole
discretion remove such content from the service, or take other steps that
spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other
party who supplied or posted that content. [CLS] [SEP] if such user or other party
believes that the content is not infringing, he or she may in certain
circumstances submit a counter-notification to spotify with a request to
restore the removed content, which spotify may or may not honor, in spotify's
sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that any content does not comply with the user guidelines,
please fill out our [notice form](https://support.spotify.com/report-
content/). [CLS] [SEP]

## 11 service limitations and modifications

spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the spotify service operational. [CLS] [SEP]
however, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates
required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may,
from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. [CLS] [SEP] spotify reserves the
right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, functions and features of the spotify service, with advance
notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited
by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the spotify
service or any function or feature thereof. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, if
you have prepaid fees to spotify for paid subscriptions that spotify
permanently discontinues prior to the end of the pre-paid period (defined in
the payments and cancellations section), spotify will refund you the prepaid
fees for the pre-paid period after such discontinuation. [CLS] [SEP] you understand,
agree, and accept that spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has
no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the service, or to
provide all or any specific content through the service. [CLS] [SEP] spotify and/or the
owners of any content may, from time to time, remove any such content without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] this section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable
law. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12 brand accounts

if you establish a spotify account on behalf of a company, organization,
entity, or brand (a "brand," and such account a "brand account"), the terms
"you" and "your," as used throughout the agreements, apply to both you and the
brand. [CLS] [SEP]

if you create a brand account, you represent and warrant that you are
authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the agreements
and to bind the brand to the agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

a brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the
brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial
relationship between the brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or
any other person, unless the brand has independently obtained the rights to
imply such an endorsement. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, brands must be transparent to our
users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists,
songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable
laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing
practices. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13 spotify support community

the spotify support community is a place for discussions and exchange of
information, tips, and other materials related to the spotify service. [CLS] [SEP] by
using the spotify support community, you agree to the [community
terms](https://www.spotify.com/legal/support-community-end-user-agreement/). [CLS] [SEP]

## 14 customer support

for customer support with account-related and payment-related questions
("customer support queries"), please submit a ticket to our customer service
department using the customer service [contact
form](https://www.spotify.com/about-us/contact/) on the about us section of
our website. [CLS] [SEP] we will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all customer
support queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that
any customer support queries will be responded to within any particular time
frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15 export control

spotify's products may be subject to u.s. [CLS] [SEP] export and re-export control laws
and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including
the export administration regulations ("ear") maintained by the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
department of commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the
treasury department's office of foreign assets control ("ofac"), and the
international traffic in arms regulations ("itar") maintained by the
department of state. [CLS] [SEP] you warrant that you are (1) not located in any country
to which the united states has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any
economic sanctions; and (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable
export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other
jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and
regulations, including the ear, trade and economic sanctions maintained by
ofac, and the itar. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or
indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of
any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or
based on such technology) received from spotify under the agreements to any
destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or
regulations of the united states or any other jurisdiction without obtaining
prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by
those laws and regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

## 16 term and termination

the agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or
spotify. [CLS] [SEP] however, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted
by you in relation to user content, including feedback, is irrevocable and
will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the agreements
for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] spotify may terminate the agreements or suspend your access to
the spotify service at any time, including in the event of your actual or
suspected unauthorized use of the spotify service and/or content, or non-
compliance with the agreements, or if we withdraw services and/or content (in
which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing
so). [CLS] [SEP] if you or spotify terminate the agreements, or if spotify suspends your
access to the spotify service, you agree that spotify shall have no liability
or responsibility to you, and spotify will not refund any amounts that you
have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] you
may terminate the agreements at any time. [CLS] [SEP] to learn how to terminate your
spotify account, please contact us through the customer service [contact
form](https://www.spotify.com/about-us/contact/) which is available on our
about us page. [CLS] [SEP] this section will be enforced to the extent permissible by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 herein, as
well as any other sections of the agreements that, either explicitly or by
their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the agreements,
shall survive termination. [CLS] [SEP]

## 17 warranty disclaimer

you understand and agree that the spotify service is provided "as is" and "as
available," without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind. [CLS] [SEP]
spotify and all owners of the content make no representations and disclaim any
warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, or non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] neither spotify nor any owner of
content warrants that the spotify service is free of malware or other harmful
components. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, spotify makes no representation nor does it warrant,
endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any third party applications

service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the
spotify service or any hyperlinked website, or featured in any banner or other

## 24 choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue

### 24.1 governing law / jurisdiction

the agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in
connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of california,
united states of america, without regard to choice or conflicts of law
principles. [CLS] [SEP]  
further, you and spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the northern district of
california to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or
arises in connection with the agreements (and any non-contractual
disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not
subject to mandatory arbitration under section 24.2.1. [CLS] [SEP]

### 24.2 arbitration agreement

_this arbitration agreement applies only to users in the united states._

#### 24.2.1 dispute resolution and arbitration

you and spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and
spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these agreements
or to your relationship with spotify as a user of the service (whether based
in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the
agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class)
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you and spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the
exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any
objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration
agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration is
more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] there is no judge or jury in
arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. [CLS] [SEP] there may be
more limited discovery than in court. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator must follow this
agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including
attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including
declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration provision will survive termination of the
agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

### 24.2.2 exceptions

notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and spotify both agree that
nothing in this arbitration agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual
action in a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking
only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of
law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, this arbitration
agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of
federal, state, or local agencies. [CLS] [SEP] such agencies can, if the law allows, seek
relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa). [CLS] [SEP]

### 24.2.3 no class or representative proceedings: class action waiver

you and spotify agree that each may bring claims against the other only in
your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class or representative action. [CLS] [SEP] unless both you and spotify agree,
no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or
otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
that party's individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] if a court decides that applicable law
precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a
particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be
severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 24.2.4 arbitration rules

either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration between
you and spotify will take place under the consumer arbitration rules of the
american arbitration association ("aaa") then in force (the "aaa rules"), as
modified by this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you and spotify agree that the federal
arbitration act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
provision (despite the choice of law provision above). [CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules, as well
as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the aaa, appear
at [adr.org](https://adr.org/), or you may call the aaa at 1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP]
spotify can also help put you in touch with the aaa. [CLS] [SEP]

any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your
billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may
choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of
documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based
telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa
rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a
filing fee, spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim
is for greater than us $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the
filing fee. [CLS] [SEP] spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share
of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by aaa rules or court
order. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any,
are based. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
arbitrator's ruling on the merits. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 24.2.5 notice; process

a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of
the dispute to the other, by certified mail, federal express, ups, or express
mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical
address on file for you, by electronic mail ("notice"). [CLS] [SEP] spotify's address for
notice is: spotify usa inc., attn: general counsel, 4 world trade center, 150
greenwich street, 62nd floor, new york, new york 10007, usa. [CLS] [SEP] the notice must
(1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth
the specific relief sought ("demand"). [CLS] [SEP] we agree to use good faith efforts to
resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so
within 30 days after the notice is received, you or spotify may commence an
arbitration proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] during the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
offer made by you or spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. [CLS] [SEP] in the event
our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the
arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of spotify's
last written settlement offer, then spotify will instead pay you either the
amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. [CLS] [SEP] all documents and
information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly
confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any
purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the
arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in
confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required
by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 24.2.6 enforceability

if this arbitration agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties
agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 24.1
shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the agreements. [CLS] [SEP]
