#  licenses

blend swap uses the[creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
license system. [CLS] [SEP] we've decided to use three licenses for all the models on
blend swap. [CLS] [SEP] we've done this to keep licensing as simple as we can on the site
while still offering authors a variety of ways to distribute and protect their
art. [CLS] [SEP]

the following is a short enumeration of how every license applies:

* * *

![crative commons zero mark](/img/cc/cc-0-256.png)

# creative commons zero mark (cc-0)

this license lets creators and owners of copyright-protected content to waive
**all** copyright interests in their works and thereby place them as
completely as possible in the **public domain** , so that others may freely
build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restrictions
under copyright. [CLS] [SEP]

you should be aware that by choosing this license you are granting the entire
world (where applicable by law) to use your work for any purpose, even without
the requirement to credit you. [CLS] [SEP] be careful with this license because once you
marked a blend as cc-zero it's out of your hands, **forever**. [CLS] [SEP]

[read more about the cc0 mark](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/)

* * *

![creative commons attribution](/img/cc/cc-by-256.png)

# creative commons attribution (cc-by)

this license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work,
**even commercially** , as long as they credit you for the original creation. [CLS] [SEP]
this is the most accommodating of licenses offered, in terms of what others
can do with your works licensed under attribution. [CLS] [SEP]

this license grants everybody in the world (where applicable by law)
permission to use a blend for any purpose, even commercial, but under an
attribution requirement, that is, the original author asks to be credited for
the blend in the derivative works of the work users. [CLS] [SEP] if a user of the blend
will not credit the original author the user has no permission to use the
blend. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

![creative commons attribution-sharealike](/img/cc/cc-by-sa_256.png)

# creative commons attribution-sharealike (cc-by-sa)

this license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work **even
commercially** , as long as they credit you and license their new creations
under the identical terms. [CLS] [SEP] this license is often compared to open source
software licenses. [CLS] [SEP] all new works based on yours will carry the same license,
so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. [CLS] [SEP]

this license grants everybody in the world (where applicable by law)
permission to use the blend for any purpose, even commercial, as long as they
credit the original author of the blend and redistribute their derivative
works under the same license. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use a cc-by-sa licensed blend, you **must** credit the original author
of the blend and your derivative work__must__ be released under the same cc-
by-sa license to the rest of the world. [CLS] [SEP]

![creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike](/img/cc/cc-by-nc-
sa-256.png)

## creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike (cc-by-nc-sa)

this license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work **non-
commercially** , as long as they credit you and license their new creations
under the identical terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use a cc-by-sa licensed blend, you **must** credit the original author
of the blend and your derivative work **must** be released under the same cc-
by-sa license to the rest of the world. [CLS] [SEP] additionaly, you **must not** use the
work for commercial purposes unless you get express consent from the original
author. [CLS] [SEP]

## what does creative commons mean to blend swap?

creative commons enables blend swap to operate under the premise of providing
free/libre blends to the world, and enables our community and features to keep
growing under the rights granted to all of us by the authors who share their
work on the site, enabling us to serve their works to the world and them to
get exposure in the blender community. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

## how should i use the works hosted on blend swap?

all blends hosted on blend swap are usable for any purpose, even commercial,
**except cc-by-nc-sa** â as long as you respect the license the blend is
under. [CLS] [SEP]

blends under cc-0 (creative commons zero) license can be used without ever
asking for permission, for any purpose, even commercially. [CLS] [SEP] you areâ advisedâ
to give attribution but you are not required to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

blends under cc-by (creativecommons-attribution) license can be used for any
purpose, even commercially, but you have the__obligation__ to credit the
author. [CLS] [SEP] if you can't credit the author, for example, because you are using the
blend in a tv spot, where credits don't exist, you must message the author of
the blend to ask for a license exclusion, but it's up to the author of the
blend to give this permission. [CLS] [SEP] blend swap will not intermediate in these
transactions. [CLS] [SEP] if the author refuses to give theâ exemptionâ permission you
will not use the blend. [CLS] [SEP]

the rule above applies also for blends under cc-by-sa (creativecommons-
attribution-sharealike) license and its extra sa clause. [CLS] [SEP] you can message the
author asking for exclusion of either of the clauses or both, but it's up to
them to give the permission. [CLS] [SEP]

keep in mind our[terms of use](/terms/ "terms of use"). [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

## how do i credit the author(s)?

when using the blend in a film production, include the author in your credits
roll. [CLS] [SEP]

if in a rendered still image, include a text file with the downloadable image
file, or add their credit to the image description meta data. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are uploading a new updated version of the blend to blend swap, please
include a link to the original blend in your blend description in this format:

> this blend uses [ name of the blend
> ](http://www.blendswap.com/url/to/the/blend/) by [ author name
> ](http://www.blendswap.com/author/profile/url/), originally released under [
> _originallicense_ ](http://www.blendswap.com/licenses/)

you are advised to keep the license the same as the original, but you can
"upgrade" them in these two ways

cc-0 â cc-by or cc-by-sa

cc-by â cc-by-sa

no other license change is allowed. [CLS] [SEP]

## fan art:

blend swap is open for everybody to upload their 3d models and related files. [CLS] [SEP]
we have insisted time and time again that you should only upload **your own
work** , made by you from the ground up, that is: _your design, your meshes,
your textures_. [CLS] [SEP]

however we're conscious that many fans of tv shows, movies, games, and
manufactured products love to use the site to share their recreations of
famous designs and ideas originally created by third party companies. [CLS] [SEP] these
works fall under the special categorization of **fan art** , that is, a model
or piece of 2d/3d art that depicts a design, logo, product or character
originally conceived by a third party artist or company not related to the
blend author or blend swap. [CLS] [SEP]

all blend swap users must know one very important thing, **fan art is not fair
use of third party designs and ideas** , as described in the english wikipedia
entry:

> the legal status of fan made art in america may be tricky due to the
> vagaries of the united states [copyright
> act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copyright_act "copyright act"). [CLS] [SEP] generally,
> the right to reproduce and display pieces of artwork is controlled by the
> original author or artist under [17
> u.s.c.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] "17 u.s.c.") â§ 106. [CLS] [SEP] however,
> fan art using settings and characters from a previously created work could
> be considered a [derivative
> work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derivative_work "derivative work"), which
> would place control of the copyright with the owner of that original work. [CLS] [SEP]
> display and distribution of fan art that would be considered a derivative
> work would be unlawful. [CLS] [SEP]
>
> however, american copyright law allows for the production, display and
> distribution of derivative works if they fall under a [fair
> use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fair_use "fair use") exemption, 17 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP]
> â§ 107. [CLS] [SEP] a court would look at all relevant facts and circumstances to
> determine whether a particular use qualifies as fair use; a multi-pronged
> rubric for this decision involves evaluating the amount and substantiality
> of the original appropriated, the transformative nature of the derivative
> work, whether the derivative work was done for educational or noncommercial
> use, and the economic effect that the derivative work imposes on the
> copyright holder's ability to make and exploit their own derivative works. [CLS] [SEP]
> none of these factors is alone dispositive. [CLS] [SEP]
>
> american courts also typically grant broad protection to
> [parody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parody "parody"), and some fan art may
> fall into this category. [CLS] [SEP] this has not explicitly been adjudicated with
> respect to fan art, however. [CLS] [SEP] moreover, while parody is typically afforded
> protection under â§ 107, a court must engage in a fact-intensive, case-
> specific inquiry for each work. [CLS] [SEP]

this means that we have to exclude your fan art from commercial use for it to
be _eligible_ for fair use exemption, this, however does **not** warrant any
type of fair use exclusion under us law (and other parts of the world), so the
copyright holder can still initiate a lawsuit for copyright infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

this is why we implemented the fan art mark on the site, to let people know,
that regardless of the license attached to the file,â nooneâ should ever use
the fan art marked works for commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

using copyrighted designs for commercial purposes without the consent of the
copyright holder is against the law in the us and most parts of the world, and
according to our terms of use, which you accept by just using the site, any
copyright infringement is your sole liability and blend swap is exempt from
your use of the site and the files you upload. [CLS] [SEP]

we must ask you to please mark your blends depicting any character, design,
product, logo etc, made by a third party unrelated to you as fan art so
everybody on the site knows about the restrictions actually ruling your file,
regardless of the cc license attached to it. [CLS] [SEP]

blend swap will stop serving or completely remove files reported for copyright
infringement by another user that presents evidence of the authorship problem
or if we receive a cease and desist request from a big company. [CLS] [SEP] as the
copyright holders companies have all their right to request complete removal
of files featuring their designs. [CLS] [SEP]

if you represent a company that has detected unlawful use of your company's
design please send a cease and desist note to:

  * blend swap, llc  
3208 e 17th st. [CLS] [SEP]  
sioux falls, sd 57103

with the following information:

  * names of the products/characters/etc
  * links of the offending models

and your request to pull the offending content offline. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

### note:

if the third party design is a cc licensed in an open source fashion, like the
open movie projects from the blender institute, or the design was released
under cc-by, cc-by-sa, cc-zero, by the original author, you don't have to mark
your blend as fan art, because this type of original material is open source
and as such, you only have to respect the original license. [CLS] [SEP] for more
information on how cc licenses apply, please read our
[licensing](/page/licenses) page. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

### remember:

according to our terms of use: by using the site and it's services and
features you accept the [terms of use](/page/terms-of-use "our terms of
use."), which clearly state all the content you submit or upload to the site
is your soleâ responsibilityâ including, but not limited to, files, comments,
feedback entries, messages, contact submissions, etc. [CLS] [SEP] ultimately, you are
responsible for copyright infringement and you have acknowledged that in no
instance shall blend swap be held responsible for the content you submit to
the website. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

### furthermore:

we do not tolerate plagiarism, ripping or impersonation. [CLS] [SEP] any user found to be
performing any of these faults, according to our [terms of use](/page/terms-
of-use), will be immediately and permanently blocked, if not banned. [CLS] [SEP] 3d art is
a very valuable asset and blatant plagiarism really does nothing good for your
reputation. [CLS] [SEP] **if you steal from another artist, sooner or later, we will
know.**

if you copy something, followed a tutorial, or revamped an open source
model/file, please say so. [CLS] [SEP] there's no shame in copying or modifying but there
is in stealing. [CLS] [SEP]
