## introduction

**we care about privacy.** we believe that privacy is a fundamental right for
all individuals. [CLS] [SEP] our clients entrust us with the personal information of their
employees and their users, who are often students. [CLS] [SEP] we take the obligations
that are attached to this information very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] we therefore have a
dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn
more about our data privacy program by visiting our [privacy
center](/privacy_center). [CLS] [SEP]

our business model is different from that of companies that collect your
personal information to monetize such data. [CLS] [SEP] we collect and use personal
information to allow us to provide our products and services to our clients
and end users. [CLS] [SEP] in most cases, we do this at the direction of our clients. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is
required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger
or acquisition. [CLS] [SEP] see vendors, partners & other types of disclosures for more
details on how we may disclose personal information in the context of changes
to our business structure. [CLS] [SEP]

we are a proud signatory of the privacy pledge 2020, and a member of the
future of privacy forum. [CLS] [SEP]

whether you are browsing our websites, receive our newsletters, or use an
online trial version of our products, this statement governs the use of
personal information for all our products and services that we provide
directly to you as a so-called ‘data controller.’

when your institution’s privacy statement/policy governs. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an end-
user of our client and we are providing our products and services to you on
our client’s (your institution’s) behalf, we are considered a ‘data
processor.’ in this case your institution’s privacy statement governs the use
of personal information. [CLS] [SEP] our privacy statement does not supersede the terms of
any agreements between us and your institution (or any other client or third
party), nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between you and your
institution. [CLS] [SEP]

such as with blackboard community and behind the blackboard. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] often you can also voluntarily provide additional information, such as a photo or biographical information, to make better use of our websites. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information you provide by completing forms or surveys on our websites. [CLS] [SEP] if you provide additional content through user forums, for example, when you communicate with others on blackboard community, we may link this information with your personal information if you are logged in. [CLS] [SEP]
  * indirectly from you. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information about the pages you visit and how you access and use our websites using cookies and third-party analytics tools.

#### how we use this information

we use this information to provide and improve our website services as
follows. [CLS] [SEP]

analytics and marketing. [CLS] [SEP] we analyze usage information for sales and marketing
purposes and for trends about our visitors and their demographics and how they
use our websites. [CLS] [SEP] this analysis is necessary to further our legitimate
interest in understanding our users and how they interact with us and our
websites, improving our websites and communication with you (including for
marketing purposes). [CLS] [SEP] [learn more about how we use personal information for
client engagement and marketing.](/privacy_statement#client-engagement-
marketing_otp-4)

personalization. [CLS] [SEP] for some of our websites we also use your information to
personalize the pages, which is necessary to provide more contextually
relevant information as you browse our websites. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you have
indicated your primary industry or your job title, we may present content
related to your role or industry as your browse our websites and return to
them. [CLS] [SEP]

communication. [CLS] [SEP] if you use behind the blackboard, blackboard community, or
other websites with logins, we use the contact details you provided to
communicate with you and to let you communicate with us and other blackboard
users. [CLS] [SEP] typically, we use information in this way because it is required to
provide this service to you and because it is in our legitimate interests to
ensure our services are being offered in a manner that meets our high
standards. [CLS] [SEP]

we keep website usage information for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes described above. [CLS] [SEP] this period of time will vary depending on the
services and websites you use and how you interact with us. [CLS] [SEP] account
information is kept until you delete the account and for a limited period
afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] where you provide information in forms, the information is kept
only as long as required. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may need to keep a record of the
correspondence with you if you have made a complaint for as long as it is
necessary to protect us from any legal claim. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you unsubscribe
from receiving marketing communications from us, will keep a record of this to
ensure you do not receive such communications in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

#### who we share this information with

third-party tools. [CLS] [SEP] where we use third-party tools (for example to understand
how our websites are used and make sure you see relevant ads and campaigns on
other websites), these third parties will have access to some of your personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] this includes analytics tools such as google analytics and

### end user of an institution that uses our products

    

your institution decides how your personal information is used. [CLS] [SEP] we provide
most of our products and services to end-users of an institution as a so-
called ‘data processor’ on behalf of our clients (for example, school,
districts, universities, and corporations). [CLS] [SEP] this means that the main
responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your institution as the
‘data controller.’ it also means that _**your institution’s privacy statement
governs**_ the use of your personal information (instead of ours). [CLS] [SEP] your
institution determines what information we collect through our products and
services and how it is used, and we process your information according to your
institution’s instructions and the terms of our contracts with your
institution. [CLS] [SEP]

information is used depends on your institution, so you should read your
institution’s privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

    * _location and events data_. [CLS] [SEP] for some of our campus enablement products and services, such as access cards and attendance, we will collect information about which premises, classes, and events you have visited and attended on behalf of your institution, as well as the time and date of such visits. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we may collect precise geolocation data when you use the mobile apps for some of our campus enablement products.

    * _information from social media sites_.

[CLS] [SEP] if your institution has enabled cloud profiles or social profiles, you can also connect your blackboard profile with your facebook and twitter account and use information from those accounts for your blackboard profile. [CLS] [SEP] the data we receive is dependent upon the social media service and your privacy settings with the social media service. [CLS] [SEP]
    * _social media posts_.
