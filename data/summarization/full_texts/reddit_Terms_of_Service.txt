# reddit user agreement

effective october 15, 2020. [CLS] [SEP] last revised september 15, 2020

**reddit powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities. [CLS] [SEP]  
** **this user agreement and your conduct make that possible.**

hello, redditors and people of the internet! this reddit user agreement (“
**terms** ”) applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps,
widgets, apis, emails, and other online products and services (collectively,
the “ **services** ”) provided by reddit, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“ **reddit** ,” “ **we** ,” “
**us** ,” or “ **our** ”). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
remember reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your
entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing or using our
services, you agree to be bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to these
terms, you may not access or use our services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
please take a look at reddit’s [privacy
policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) too—it explains how and why
we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our
services. [CLS] [SEP]

**1\. [CLS] [SEP] your access to the services**

children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise
use the services. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, you must be over the age required by the laws
of your country to create an account or otherwise use the services, or we need
to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, certain of our services or portions of our services require you
to be 18 years of age or older, so please read all notices and any additional
terms carefully when you access the services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are accepting these terms on behalf of another legal entity, including
a business or government entity, you represent that you have full legal
authority to bind such entity to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the services**

reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable,
limited license to use and access the services solely as permitted by these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

except as permitted through the services or as otherwise permitted by us in
writing, your license does not include the right to:

  * license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the services or content;
  * modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the services or content; or
  * access the services or content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the [reddit api terms of use](https://docs.google.com/a/reddit.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlseznddnk1-p8mspsbmtc2r86ee9zrbc66u929cg2gx0t9umyw/viewform). [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the services (in whole
or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] any future release,
update, or other addition to functionality of the services will be subject to
these terms, which may be updated from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we will
not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension,
or discontinuation of the services or any part thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

**3\. [CLS] [SEP] your reddit account and account security**

to use certain features of our services, you may be required to create a
reddit account (an “ **account** ”) and provide us with a username, password,
and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the [privacy
policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

you are solely responsible for the information associated with your account
and anything that happens related to your account. [CLS] [SEP] you must maintain the
security of your account and immediately [notify reddit
](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request)if you discover or suspect that
someone has accessed your account without your permission. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that
you use a strong password that is used only with your account and [enable two-
factor authentication](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-
reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication). [CLS] [SEP]

you will not license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written
approval. [CLS] [SEP]

**4\. [CLS] [SEP] your content**

the services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos,
or other materials (“ **content** ”), including content created or submitted
to the services by you or through your account (“ **your content** ”). [CLS] [SEP] we take
no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support,
or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any
of your content. [CLS] [SEP]

by submitting your content to the services, you represent and warrant that you
have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to your
content contained within these terms. [CLS] [SEP] because you alone are responsible for
your content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share
content without all necessary rights. [CLS] [SEP]

you retain any ownership rights you have in your content, but you grant reddit
the following license to use that content:

when your content is created with or submitted to the services, you grant us a
worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable,
and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative
works of, distribute, store, perform, and display your content and any name,
username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with your content in all
media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. [CLS] [SEP]
this license includes the right for us to make your content available for
syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies,
organizations, or individuals who partner with reddit. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that we
may remove metadata associated with your content, and you irrevocably waive
any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your
content. [CLS] [SEP]

any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about reddit or our services that you
provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that reddit may use such
ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you. [CLS] [SEP]

although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor your content, we
may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove your content at any time and for
any reason, including for violating these terms, violating our [content
policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), or if you
otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us. [CLS] [SEP]

**5\. [CLS] [SEP] third-party content, advertisements, and promotions**

the services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services,
which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other
users (“ **third-party content** ”). [CLS] [SEP] third-party content is not under our
control, and we are not responsible for any third party’s websites, products,
or services. [CLS] [SEP] your use of third-party content is at your own risk and you
should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any
transaction in connection with such third-party content. [CLS] [SEP]

the services may also contain sponsored third-party content or advertisements. [CLS] [SEP]
the type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and
you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with
the display of any content or information on the services, including your
content. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to use the services to conduct a promotion, including a contest
or sweepstakes (“ **promotion** ”), you alone are responsible for conducting
the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at your
own risk. [CLS] [SEP] your promotion must state that the promotion is not sponsored by,
endorsed by, or associated with reddit, and the rules for your promotion must
require each entrant or participant to release reddit from any liability
related to the promotion. [CLS] [SEP]

**6\. [CLS] [SEP] things you cannot do**

when using or accessing reddit, you must comply with these terms and all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations. [CLS] [SEP] please review the [content
policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) (and for rpan, the
[broadcasting content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/broadcasting-
content-policy)), which are part of these terms and contain reddit’s rules
about prohibited content and conduct. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to what is prohibited in the
[content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), you may
not do any of the following:

  * use the services in any manner that could interfere with, disable, disrupt, overburden, or otherwise impair the services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * gain access to (or attempt to gain access to) another user’s account or any non-public portions of the services, including the computer systems or networks connected to or used together with the services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the services any viruses, worms, malicious code, or other software intended to interfere with the services, including its security-related features. [CLS] [SEP]
  * use the services to violate applicable law or infringe any person’s or entity's intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights. [CLS] [SEP]
  * access, search, or collect data from the services by any means (automated or otherwise) except as permitted in these terms or in a separate agreement with reddit. [CLS] [SEP] we conditionally grant permission to crawl the services in accordance with the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file, but scraping the services without reddit’s prior consent is prohibited. [CLS] [SEP]
  * use the services in any manner that we reasonably believe to be an abuse of or fraud on reddit or any payment system. [CLS] [SEP]

we encourage you to [report](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
content or conduct that you believe violates these terms or our [content
policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). [CLS] [SEP] we also support
the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. [CLS] [SEP] to report a security
issue, please email [security@reddit.com](mailto:security@reddit.com). [CLS] [SEP]

**7\. [CLS] [SEP] moderators**

moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be
available to users of the services. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for actions taken
by the moderators. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to
moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach
of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to moderate a subreddit:

  * you agree to follow the [moderator guidelines for healthy communities](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/);
  * you agree that when you receive reports related to a subreddit you moderate, you will take appropriate action, which may include removing content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to reddit for review;
  * you are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on behalf of reddit;
  * you may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;
  * you may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from third parties;
  * if you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
  * you may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these terms, the [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), or the [moderator guidelines for healthy communities](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/). [CLS] [SEP]

reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or
decision of a moderator if reddit, in its sole discretion, believes that such
action or decision is not in the interest of reddit or the reddit community. [CLS] [SEP]

**8\. [CLS] [SEP] copyright, trademark, the dmca, and takedowns**

reddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of
our services do the same. [CLS] [SEP] we have a policy that includes the removal of any
infringing material from the services and for the termination, in appropriate
circumstances, of users of our services who are repeat infringers. [CLS] [SEP] if you
believe that anything on our services infringes a copyright or a trademark
that you own or control, you may notify reddit’s designated agent by filling
out our [copyright report form](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-

your violation of these terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or

**12\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability**

in no event and under no theory of liability, including contract, tort,
negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise, will the reddit entities
be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental,
special, or punitive damages, or lost profits arising from or relating to
these terms or the services, including those arising from or relating to
content made available on the services that is alleged to be defamatory,
offensive, or illegal. [CLS] [SEP] access to, and use of, the services is at your own
discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your
device or computer system, or loss of data resulting therefrom. [CLS] [SEP] in no event
will the aggregate liability of the reddit entities exceed the greater of one
hundred u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars ($100) or any amount you paid reddit in the previous six
months for the services giving rise to the claim. [CLS] [SEP] the limitations of this
section will apply to any theory of liability, including those based on
warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, and
even if the reddit entities have been advised of the possibility of any such
damage, and even if any remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its
essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing limitation of liability will apply to the
fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

**13\. [CLS] [SEP] governing law and venue**

we want you to enjoy reddit, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to
raise it and try to resolve it with us informally. [CLS] [SEP] you can contact us with
feedback and concerns [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
except for the government entities listed below, any claims arising out of or
relating to these terms or the services will be governed by the laws of
california, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. [CLS] [SEP] all disputes related

jurisdiction in these courts. [CLS] [SEP]

**government entities**

if you are a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] city, county, or state government entity, then this section
13 does not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal government entity, any claims arising out of or
relating to these terms or the services will be governed by the laws of the
united states of america without regard to its conflict of laws rules. [CLS] [SEP] to the
extent permitted by federal law, the laws of california (other than its
conflict of law rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law. [CLS] [SEP]
all disputes related to these terms or the services will be brought solely in
the federal or state courts located in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP]

**14\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to these terms**

we may make changes to these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we make changes, we
will post the revised terms and update the effective date above. [CLS] [SEP] if the
changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by
sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have
chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through
our services. [CLS] [SEP] by continuing to access or use the services on or after the
effective date of the revised terms, you agree to be bound by the revised
terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to the revised terms, you must stop accessing and
using our services before the changes become effective. [CLS] [SEP]

**15\. [CLS] [SEP] additional terms**

because we offer a variety of services, you may be asked to agree to
additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by reddit
(“ **additional terms** ”). [CLS] [SEP] to the extent any additional terms conflict with
these terms, the additional terms govern with respect to your use of the
corresponding service. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use reddit premium or virtual goods, you must also agree to the[ reddit
premium and virtual goods
agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/premium-and-virtual-goods-
agreement). [CLS] [SEP]

if you use the self-service platform for advertising, you must also agree to
our [reddit advertising platform
terms](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-
guidelines/advertising-terms-ads-platform). [CLS] [SEP]

if you use our public api, you must also agree to our [reddit api terms of
use](https://docs.google.com/a/reddit.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlseznddnk1-p8mspsbmtc2r86ee9zrbc66u929cg2gx0t9umyw/viewform). [CLS] [SEP]

if you use reddit gifts, you must agree to the [reddit gifts user
agreement](https://www.redditgifts.com/terms/). [CLS] [SEP]

**16\. [CLS] [SEP] termination**

you may terminate these terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your
account and discontinuing use of all services. [CLS] [SEP] if you stop using the services
without deactivating your account, your account may be deactivated due to
prolonged inactivity. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend or terminate your account, moderator status, or ability to
access or use the services at any time for any or no reason, including for
violating these terms or our [content
policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

the following sections will survive any termination of these terms or of your
account: 4 (your content), 6 (things you cannot do), 10 (indemnity), 11
(disclaimers), 12 (limitation of liability), 13 (governing law and venue), 16
(termination), and 17 (miscellaneous). [CLS] [SEP]

**17\. [CLS] [SEP] miscellaneous**

these terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your
access to and use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] our failure to exercise or enforce any
right or provision of these terms will not operate as a waiver of such right
or provision. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of these terms is, for any reason, held to be
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the rest of the terms will remain in
effect. [CLS] [SEP] you may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under
these terms without our consent. [CLS] [SEP] we may freely assign any of our rights and
obligations under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
