### __general questions

#### __q: what is telegram? what do i do here?

telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-
fast, simple and free. [CLS] [SEP] you can use telegram on all your devices **at the same
time** — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones,
tablets or computers. [CLS] [SEP] telegram has over **500 million** monthly active users
and is one of the **10 most downloaded apps** in the world. [CLS] [SEP]

with telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and
[**files**](/blog/shared-files) of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as
create groups for up to **200,000** people or [channels](/blog/channels) for
broadcasting to **unlimited** audiences. [CLS] [SEP] you can write to your phone contacts
and find people by their **usernames**. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, telegram is like sms and
email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging
needs. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted
[**voice**](https://telegram.org/blog/calls) and [**video
calls**](https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls), as well as [**voice chats in
groups**](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats) for thousands of
participants. [CLS] [SEP]

> follow our [**tips channel**](https://t.me/telegramtips) to learn more about
> telegram features. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: who is telegram for?

telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and
[calls](https://telegram.org/blog/calls). [CLS] [SEP] business users and small teams may
like the large groups, [usernames](https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-
me), [desktop apps](https://desktop.telegram.org) and powerful [file
sharing](https://telegram.org/blog/shared-files) options. [CLS] [SEP]

since telegram groups can have up to [200,000
members](https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers), we support
[replies, mentions and hashtags](https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-
hashtags) that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities
[efficient](https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers). [CLS] [SEP] you can
appoint [admins with advanced tools](https://telegram.org/blog/admin-
revolution) to help these communities prosper in peace. [CLS] [SEP] [public
groups](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups5k) can be joined by anyone and
are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback. [CLS] [SEP]

in case you're more into pictures, telegram has animated [gif
search](/blog/gif-revolution), a state of the art [photo
editor](https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes), and an [open
sticker platform](/blog/stickers-revolution) (find some cool stickers
[here](https://t.me/durov/40) or [here](https://t.me/sticker)). [CLS] [SEP] what's more,
there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. [CLS] [SEP] with telegram's
cloud support and [cache management options](https://telegram.org/blog/cache-
and-stickers), telegram can take up nearly **zero** space on your phone. [CLS] [SEP]

those looking for extra privacy should check out our [advanced
settings](/blog/privacy-revolution) and rather revolutionary
[policy](/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] and if you want secrecy, try our device-specific secret
chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app
with an additional [passcode](https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-
passcodes). [CLS] [SEP]

> we keep evolving — check out our [brief history of
> telegram](https://telegram.org/evolution) and follow us on
> [twitter](https://twitter.com/telegram) and
> [telegram](https://t.me/telegram) to stay in touch. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how is telegram different from whatsapp?

unlike whatsapp, telegram is a cloud-based messenger with **seamless sync**. [CLS] [SEP]
as a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once,
including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos,
videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to **2 gb** _each_. [CLS] [SEP]

telegram needs less than **100 mb** on your device – you can keep **all your
media** in the cloud without deleting things – simply [clear your cache to
free up space](https://t.me/telegramtips/206). [CLS] [SEP]

thanks to telegram' multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, is faster
and way more secure. [CLS] [SEP] on top of that, private messaging on telegram is free and
will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever. [CLS] [SEP]

telegram's api and code is open, and developers are welcome to create their
own telegram apps. [CLS] [SEP] we also have a [bot api](https://core.telegram.org/bots), a
platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools
for telegram, [integrate any services](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots),
and even [accept payments](https://telegram.org/blog/payments) from users
around the world. [CLS] [SEP]

and that's just the tip of the iceberg. [CLS] [SEP]

> follow our [**tips channel**](https://t.me/telegramtips) to learn more about
> telegram features. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how old is telegram?

telegram for ios was launched on **august 14, 2013**. [CLS] [SEP] the alpha version of
telegram for android officially launched on october 20, 2013. [CLS] [SEP] more and more
[telegram clients](/apps) appear, built by independent developers using
telegram's [open platform](//core.telegram.org/api). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: which devices can i use?

you can use telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers. [CLS] [SEP] we have apps
for [ios](https://telegram.org/dl/ios) (9.0 and above),
[android](https://telegram.org/dl/android) (4.1 and up), a native [macos
app](https://macos.telegram.org) and a universal [desktop
app](https://desktop.telegram.org) for windows, macos, and linux. [CLS] [SEP] [telegram
web](https://web.telegram.org) can also help to quickly do something on the
go. [CLS] [SEP]

> you can log in to telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all
> **at the same time**. [CLS] [SEP] just use your main mobile phone number to log in
> everywhere, your cloud chats will sync instantly. [CLS] [SEP]

the [telegram api](//core.telegram.org/api) is open for developers, should you
want to build your own applications for other platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: who are the people behind telegram?

telegram is supported by [pavel
durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_durov) and his brother nikolai. [CLS] [SEP]
pavel supports telegram financially and ideologically while nikolai's input is
technological. [CLS] [SEP] to make telegram possible, nikolai developed a unique custom
data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple
data-centers. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, telegram combines security, reliability and speed
on any network. [CLS] [SEP]

> see also: [articles about telegram](/press)

#### __q: where is telegram based?

the telegram development team is based in dubai. [CLS] [SEP]

most of the developers behind telegram originally come from st. [CLS] [SEP] petersburg,
the city famous for its unprecedented number of [highly skilled
engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acm_international_collegiate_programming_contest#winners). [CLS] [SEP]
the telegram team had to leave russia due to local it regulations and has
tried a number of locations as its base, including berlin, london and
singapore. [CLS] [SEP] we’re currently happy with dubai, although are ready to relocate
again if local regulations change. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: will you have ads in my private chats and groups? or sell my data?
or steal my beloved and enslave my children?

no. [CLS] [SEP] see [this post](https://t.me/durov/142) for details. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how are you going to make money out of this?

we believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free. [CLS] [SEP]

our founder and ceo [pavel durov](/press), who financed telegram throughout
most of its history, has outlined a **strategy to make telegram sustainable**
in [this post](https://t.me/durov/142). [CLS] [SEP]

while telegram will introduce monetization in 2021 to pay for the
infrastructure and developer salaries, making profits will never be an end-
goal for us. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what are your thoughts on internet privacy?

we think that the two most important components of internet privacy should be:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc. [CLS] [SEP]

telegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary
[privacy policy](/privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what about gdpr?

the general data protection regulation (gdpr) came into force in europe on may
25, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made
telegram, there wasn't much we had to change. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t use your data for ad
targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any ~~mafia
family~~ “family of companies.”

telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich
cloud service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your cloud chats – so that you can access them
from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts – so that
you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on telegram. [CLS] [SEP]
please see our [privacy policy](https://telegram.org/privacy) for more
information. [CLS] [SEP]

you can use [**@gdprbot**](https://t.me/gdprbot) to:

  * request a copy of all your data that telegram stores. [CLS] [SEP]
  * contact us about data privacy. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: there's illegal content on telegram. [CLS] [SEP] how do i take it down?

all telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not process any requests related to them. [CLS] [SEP]

but **sticker sets** , **channels** , and **bots** on telegram are _publicly
available_. [CLS] [SEP] if you find sticker sets or bots on telegram that you think are
illegal, please ping us at [abuse@telegram.org](mailto:abuse@telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP]

you can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see [this
post](https://t.me/isiswatch/2) on our official [@isiswatch
channel](https://t.me/isiswatch) for details. [CLS] [SEP]

> note: if a scammer is pretending to be you, contact
> [@notoscam](https://t.me/notoscam)

#### __q: a bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. [CLS] [SEP] what do i do?

all telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not process any requests related to them. [CLS] [SEP] but **sticker sets** ,
**channels** , and **bots** on telegram are _publicly available_. [CLS] [SEP]

if you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your
copyright, kindly submit a complaint to
[dmca@telegram.org](mailto:dmca@telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP] please note that such requests
should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act
on the owner’s behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: wait! 0_o do you process take-down requests from third parties?

our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works
everywhere on the planet. [CLS] [SEP] to do this in the places where it is most needed
(and to continue distributing telegram through the app store and google play),
we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal **public** content
(e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we can
take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. [CLS] [SEP]

user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are
not part of the core telegram ui. [CLS] [SEP] whenever we receive a complaint at
[abuse@telegram.org](mailto:abuse@telegram.org) or
[dmca@telegram.org](mailto:dmca@telegram.org) regarding the legality of public
content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed
appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that this does **not** apply to local restrictions on freedom of
speech. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country,
telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. [CLS] [SEP] this goes
against our founders' [principles](https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/russias-
mark-zuckerberg-pavel-durov/). [CLS] [SEP] while we do block terrorist (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] isis-related)
bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses
alternative opinions. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: my bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do i do?

if you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent
reasons, drop us a line at [abuse@telegram.org](mailto:abuse@telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: do you process data requests?

secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data
to disclose. [CLS] [SEP]

to protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, telegram
uses a distributed infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] cloud chat data is stored in multiple data
centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities
spread across different jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP] the relevant decryption keys are split
into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. [CLS] [SEP] as a
result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to
force us to give up any data. [CLS] [SEP]

thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of
like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of
expression. [CLS] [SEP] telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave
and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems
around the world. [CLS] [SEP]

to this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties,
including governments. [CLS] [SEP]

### __telegram basics

> follow our [**tips channel**](https://t.me/telegramtips) to learn more about
> telegram features. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: who can i write to?

you can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have telegram. [CLS] [SEP]
another way of contacting people is to type their telegram username into the
search field – you don't need to know their phone number to do this. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: who can contact me?

people can contact you on telegram if they **know your phone number** or if
you **message them first**. [CLS] [SEP]

if they don't know your phone number, they can find you in these cases:

  * when you both are members of the **same group**. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you set a **public username**. [CLS] [SEP] others can use **global search** and find you by your username. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you **opt-in** to appear in the people nearby section (this is **turned off** by default). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i know who in my contacts has telegram?

your contacts, who have telegram, are shown at the top of your contacts. [CLS] [SEP] they
also have pictures. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i invite my friends?

_ios:_ the basic invitations are simple sms messages. [CLS] [SEP] they will be charged as
standard outgoing sms by your carrier (unless sent via imessage). [CLS] [SEP] naturally,
you have other options to bring your friends here. [CLS] [SEP] try sending them a download
link via any other messaging service: email, facebook, whatsapp, an actual
telegram — you name it. [CLS] [SEP] the link:
[**<https://telegram.org/dl/>**](https://telegram.org/dl/)

_android:_ open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) > invite friends. [CLS] [SEP] then
choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations. [CLS] [SEP]

> you can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can
> easily find you on telegram even if they don't have your phone number. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what do the check marks mean?

_one check_ — message delivered to the telegram cloud and your friend has been
notified if he allows notifications. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _two checks_ — message read (your friend opened telegram and opened the
conversation with the message). [CLS] [SEP]

we don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because telegram can
run on as many devices as you want. [CLS] [SEP] so which particular one would that check
mean?

#### __q: can i hide my ‘last seen’ time?

you can choose who sees this info in [privacy and
security](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-revolution) settings. [CLS] [SEP]

remember that you won't see last seen timestamps for people with whom you
don't share your own. [CLS] [SEP] you will, however, see an approximate last seen value. [CLS] [SEP]
this keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person
is reachable over telegram. [CLS] [SEP] there are four possible approximate values:

  * **last seen recently** — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days
  * **last seen within a week** — between 2-3 and seven days
  * **last seen within a month** — between 6-7 days and a month
  * **last seen a long time ago** — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)

#### __q: who can see me'online'?

the last seen rules apply to your online status as well. [CLS] [SEP] people can only see
you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them. [CLS] [SEP]

there are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online. [CLS] [SEP]
regardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief
period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:

  * send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members. [CLS] [SEP]
  * read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat. [CLS] [SEP]
  * broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members. [CLS] [SEP]

if you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do
anything of the above, they'll never see you online. [CLS] [SEP] another way of achieving
this is to block that person. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what is people nearby?

people nearby is an _optional_ feature that allows telegram users to **explore
local groups** , **find friends** to chat with in their area, or quickly
**exchange contacts** with people who are close. [CLS] [SEP]

you can find it in _contacts > find people nearby_, as well as directly in the
side menu on android. [CLS] [SEP]

while you have the people nearby section **open on your screen** , people who
are _very close_ will be able to see you there. [CLS] [SEP] if you don't open the section,
others will **never** see you in 'people nearby'. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also choose to permanently add your profile to the list of nearby
people by tapping **make myself visible**. [CLS] [SEP] after becoming visible, you can
remove your profile from the list at any time by tapping **stop showing me**. [CLS] [SEP]

> **note:** people nearby is **never turned on by default** – users must
> manually enable it. [CLS] [SEP] if you are receiving messages from someone you don't
> know, see _q: who can contact me?_

#### __q: can i delete my messages?

yes. [CLS] [SEP] you can always delete any messages you **sent** or **received** for _both
sides_ in _any_ one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own
messages only). [CLS] [SEP] you can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. [CLS] [SEP] on
telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat. [CLS] [SEP]

together with privacy settings for [forwarded messages](/blog/unsend-privacy-
emoji#anonymous-forwarding), this makes exchanging telegram messages similar
to talking face to face (without a tape recorder). [CLS] [SEP] as a result, users no
longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the
years. [CLS] [SEP] both parties in a conversation have full control over what does and
what doesn't belong to their online identity. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i make calls via telegram?

yes! you can make end-to-end encrypted [voice
calls](https://telegram.org/blog/calls) and [video
calls](https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls). [CLS] [SEP]

if you want more participants, try starting a [voice
chat](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats) in one of the **groups** you
created. [CLS] [SEP] voice chats add a live layer of ephemeral talk to the group. [CLS] [SEP] they can
be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any
community. [CLS] [SEP] while voice chats are not group calls, they can achieve similar
goals. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how can i use emoticons?

type **one word** in your input field to get relevant [emoji
suggestions](https://t.me/telegramtips/221). [CLS] [SEP] you can also type “:” followed by
any keyword to open **emoji search** – like _:heart_. [CLS] [SEP]

you can suggest missing keywords for emoji in your language using [this
interface](https://translations.telegram.org/en/emoji) (this will open
suggestions for _english_ , don't forget to change to your _language_ in the
left menu). [CLS] [SEP]

### __groups and channels

#### __q: what makes telegram groups cool?

telegram groups can have up to **200,000 members** each and are extremely
powerful communication tools. [CLS] [SEP] here are a few key features that make them stand
out in the messaging world:

**unified history**  
edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for
everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

**cross-platform availability**  
access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop
devices. [CLS] [SEP]

**instant search**  
find the message you're looking for, even among millions. [CLS] [SEP] filter by sender to
make searching easier. [CLS] [SEP]

**replies, mentions, hashtags**  
easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the
group size. [CLS] [SEP]

**smart notifications**  
mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to
your messages. [CLS] [SEP]

**pinned messages**  
you can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen. [CLS] [SEP] all
members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from
your group. [CLS] [SEP]

**moderation tools**  
appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and
pin important messages. [CLS] [SEP] define their admin privileges with granular precision. [CLS] [SEP]

**group permissions**  
set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of
content. [CLS] [SEP] or even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let
the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching. [CLS] [SEP]

**file sharing**  
send and receive files of any type, up to 2 gb in size each, access them
instantly on your other devices. [CLS] [SEP]

**public groups**  
get a short link for your group and make it public, like
[t.me/publictestgroup](https://t.me/publictestgroup). [CLS] [SEP] this way, anybody can
view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages. [CLS] [SEP]

**customization via bots**  
create custom tools for any specific needs using our [bot
api](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and [inline
bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what's the difference between groups and channels?

telegram **groups** are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or
collaboration in small teams. [CLS] [SEP] but groups can also grow very large and support
communities of up to 200,000 members. [CLS] [SEP] you can make any group **public** ,
toggle **persistent history** to control whether or not new members have
access to earlier messages and appoint **administrators** with granular
privileges. [CLS] [SEP] you can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so
that all members can see them, including those who have just joined. [CLS] [SEP]

**channels** are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. [CLS] [SEP] in fact,
a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. [CLS] [SEP] when you post in a
channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your
own. [CLS] [SEP] each message in a channel has a **view counter** that gets updated when
the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i create a group?

_ios:_ start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in chats) >
'new group'. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _android:_ tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list > 'new group'. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _telegram desktop:_ click the menu button in the top left corner > 'new
group'. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i assign administrators?

you can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their
privileges with granular precision. [CLS] [SEP]

_ios:_ go to group info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s
chat screen) > edit > administrators. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _android:_ go to group info (tap the name in the header) > the pencil icon
(in the top right corner) > administrators. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _telegram desktop:_ when in the group, click '…' in the top right corner >
manage group > administrators. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i add more members? what's an invite link?

you can add your contacts, or using search by username. [CLS] [SEP]

it is easy to migrate existing groups to telegram by sending people an
**invite link**. [CLS] [SEP] to create an invite link, go to group info > add member >
invite to group via link. [CLS] [SEP]

anyone who has telegram installed will be able to join your group by following
this link. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately. [CLS] [SEP]

> [read more about invite links in our blog »](/blog/invite-links)

### __usernames and t.me

#### __q: what are usernames? how do i get one?

you can set up a **public** username on telegram. [CLS] [SEP] it then becomes possible for
other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search
under 'global results'. [CLS] [SEP] please note that people who find you will be able to
send you messages, even if they don't know your number. [CLS] [SEP] if you are not
comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in telegram. [CLS] [SEP]

you can set up a username in settings and use the universal search box in the
chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how does t.me work?

once you've set up a username, you can give people a
[t.me/username](https://t.me/username) link. [CLS] [SEP] opening that link on their phone
will automatically fire up their telegram app and open a chat with you. [CLS] [SEP] you
can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put
them up on your website. [CLS] [SEP]

this way people can contact you on telegram without knowing your phone number. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what can i use as my username?

you can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. [CLS] [SEP] usernames are case-insensitive, but
telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] telegram and
telegram is the same user). [CLS] [SEP] the username must be at least five characters
long. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: do i need a username?

you don't have to get one. [CLS] [SEP] remember that telegram usernames are public and
choosing a username on telegram makes it possible for people to find you in
global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number. [CLS] [SEP] if
you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: if someone finds me by username, messages and i reply — will they
know my number?

no. [CLS] [SEP] neither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by
your privacy settings). [CLS] [SEP] this is similar to the case when you message a person
who you've met in a telegram group. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i delete my username?

go to settings and save an empty username. [CLS] [SEP] this will remove your username;
people will no longer be able to find you via search. [CLS] [SEP] this will not affect
existing conversations. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what do i do if my username is taken?

telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis. [CLS] [SEP]

we understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some
of us. [CLS] [SEP] if your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you
acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same
username on at least **two** of these services: facebook, twitter, instagram. [CLS] [SEP]

due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel
usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots
and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames. [CLS] [SEP]

to request a username, contact [@username_bot](https://t.me/username_bot). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what if someone is pretending to be me?

if a scammer is pretending to be you, please contact
[@notoscam](https://t.me/notoscam). [CLS] [SEP]

### __security

> if you are an advanced user, you may find our [faq for the technically
> inclined](https://core.telegram.org/techfaq) useful as well. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how secure is telegram?

telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like whatsapp and line. [CLS] [SEP] we
are based on the mtproto protocol (see
[description](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and [advanced
faq](https://core.telegram.org/techfaq)), built upon time-tested algorithms to
make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak
connections. [CLS] [SEP] we are continuously working with the community to improve the
security of our protocol and clients. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what if i’m more paranoid than your regular user?

we've got you covered. [CLS] [SEP] telegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end
encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages
and don’t allow forwarding. [CLS] [SEP] on top of this, secret chats are not part of the
telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: so how do you encrypt data?

we support two layers of secure encryption. [CLS] [SEP] [server-client
encryption](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) is used in cloud chats (private
and group chats), secret chats use an additional layer of [client-client
encryption](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end). [CLS] [SEP] all data, regardless of
type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files. [CLS] [SEP]

our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric aes encryption, 2048-bit rsa
encryption, and diffie–hellman secure key exchange. [CLS] [SEP] you can find more info in
the [advanced faq](https://core.telegram.org/techfaq). [CLS] [SEP]

> see also: [do you process data requests?](https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-
> process-data-requests)

#### __q: why should i trust you?

telegram is open, anyone can check our [source code](/apps#source-code),
[protocol](//core.telegram.org/mtproto) and [api](//core.telegram.org/api),
see how everything works and make an informed decision. [CLS] [SEP] telegram supports
[verifiable builds](https://telegram.org/blog/verifiable-apps-and-more), which
allow experts to independently verify that our code published on github is the
**exact same code** that is used to build the apps you download from app store
or google play. [CLS] [SEP]

we welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at
[security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP]

on top of that, telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so
commercial interests will never interfere with our mission. [CLS] [SEP]

> see also: [articles about telegram](/press)

#### __q: do i need to trust telegram for this to be secure?

when it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized
key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings. [CLS] [SEP]
[more about this below](faq#q-what-is-this-39encryption-key-39-thing). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what if my hacker friend says they could decipher telegram messages?

anyone who claims that telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove
that claim in our competition and [win
$300,000](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest). [CLS] [SEP] you can check out the
[cracking contest description](https://core.telegram.org/contest300k) to learn
more. [CLS] [SEP]

any comments on telegram's security are welcome at
[security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP] all submissions which
result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging
from **$100** to [**$100,000**](https://telegram.org/blog/crowdsourcing-a-
more-secure-future) or more, depending on the severity of the issue. [CLS] [SEP] please
note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the
public before they are fixed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can telegram protect me against everything?

telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. [CLS] [SEP]
this means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive
via telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service
provider, owners of wi-fi routers you connect to, or other third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

but please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she
takes your unlocked phone without a passcode. [CLS] [SEP] or from your it-department if
they access your computer at work. [CLS] [SEP] or from any other people that get physical
or [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superuser) access to your phones or
computers running telegram. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly
recommend using only secret chats in official or at least verifiable open-
source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer. [CLS] [SEP]
we also recommend enabling 2-step verification and setting up a strong
passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in settings > privacy
and security. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how does 2-step verification work?

logging in with an sms code is an industry standard in messaging, but if
you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier
or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional
password. [CLS] [SEP]

you can do this in **settings > privacy and security > 2-step verification**. [CLS] [SEP]
once enabled, you will need both an sms code and a password to log in. [CLS] [SEP] you can
also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you
forget your password. [CLS] [SEP] if you do so, please remember that it's important that
the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-step
verification when possible. [CLS] [SEP]

[check this out](https://xkcd.com/936/) for tips on creating a strong password
that is easy to remember. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?

using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker
to gain full administrative control over your device — [root
access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superuser). [CLS] [SEP]

a user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the
operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the
[internal storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-
storage#filesinternal). [CLS] [SEP] once an attacker has root access, any efforts to
mitigate threats become futile. [CLS] [SEP] no application can be called safe under these
circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption. [CLS] [SEP]

### __secret chats

#### __q: how are secret chats different?

secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average
fella. [CLS] [SEP] all messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. [CLS] [SEP] this means only
you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them,
including us here at telegram (more on this here). [CLS] [SEP] on top of this, messages
cannot be forwarded from secret chats. [CLS] [SEP] and when you delete messages on your
side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be
ordered to delete them as well. [CLS] [SEP]

you can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a
set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] the
message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices. [CLS] [SEP]

all secret chats in telegram are device-specific and are not part of the
telegram cloud. [CLS] [SEP] this means you can only access messages in a secret chat from
their device of origin. [CLS] [SEP] they are safe for as long as your device is safe in
your pocket. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i start a secret chat?

open the profile of the user you want to contact. [CLS] [SEP] tap on ‘…’, then ‘start
secret chat’. [CLS] [SEP]

remember that telegram secret chats are device-specific. [CLS] [SEP] if you start a secret
chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on
that device. [CLS] [SEP] if you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. [CLS] [SEP] you can
create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do self-destructing messages work?

the self-destruct timer is available for **all messages** in secret chats and
for **media** in private cloud chats. [CLS] [SEP]

to set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on ios, top
bar on android), and then choose the desired time limit. [CLS] [SEP] the clock starts
ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets
two check marks). [CLS] [SEP] as soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from
**both** devices. [CLS] [SEP] we will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that the timer in secret chats only applies to messages that were
sent **after** the timer was set. [CLS] [SEP] it has no effect on earlier messages. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a
screenshot?

unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain
systems (most notably, some android and windows phone devices). [CLS] [SEP] we will make
every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your secret chats, but it
may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots
silently. [CLS] [SEP] we advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust. [CLS] [SEP]
after all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with
a different device or an old school camera. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what is this'encryption key' thing?

when a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption
keys using the so-called [diffie-hellman key
exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffie%e2%80%93hellman_key_exchange). [CLS] [SEP]
after the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a
picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. [CLS] [SEP] you can then compare
this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you
can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no [man-in-the-middle
attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle_attack) can succeed. [CLS] [SEP]

newer versions of telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a
textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!)
when both participants are using an updated app. [CLS] [SEP]

always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure —
it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the
conversation partner. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: why not just make all chats'secret'?

all telegram messages are always securely encrypted. [CLS] [SEP] messages in secret chats
use **client-client** encryption, while cloud chats use **client-
server/server-client** encryption and are stored encrypted in the telegram
cloud (more [here](https://telegram.org/privacy#4-1-storing-data)). [CLS] [SEP] this
enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from
any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether. [CLS] [SEP]

the problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected
device (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] when you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in
the end-to-end encryption paradigm. [CLS] [SEP] at the same time, reliable backups are an
essential feature for any mass-market messenger. [CLS] [SEP] to solve this problem, some
applications (like whatsapp and viber) allow [decryptable
backups](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/where-whatsapp-went-wrong-effs-
four-biggest-security-concerns) that put their users' privacy at risk – even
if they do not enable backups themselves. [CLS] [SEP] other apps ignore the need for
backups altogether and leave their users vulnerable to data loss. [CLS] [SEP]

we opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats. [CLS] [SEP]
telegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an
integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of cloud chats. [CLS] [SEP]
meanwhile, the separate entity of secret chats gives you full control over the
data you do not want to be stored. [CLS] [SEP]

this allows telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by
activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using telegram does not
mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries. [CLS] [SEP] we are
convinced that the separation of conversations into cloud and secret chats
represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular
messaging application. [CLS] [SEP]

### __your account

#### __q: who can see my phone number?

on telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making
your phone number visible. [CLS] [SEP] by default, your number is only visible to people
who you've added to your address book as contacts. [CLS] [SEP] you can further modify this
in _settings > privacy and security > phone number_. [CLS] [SEP]

> note that people will always see your number if they know it already and
> **saved** it in their address book. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: i have a new phone number, what do i do?

each phone number is a **separate** account on telegram. [CLS] [SEP] you have several
options if you are using multiple phone numbers:

  * if you will **no longer use the old number** (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to settings and change the number connected to your telegram account to the new number. [CLS] [SEP] **important:** make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you will use the new number for a **limited time** (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you want to keep using **both numbers** (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your telegram number. [CLS] [SEP] you _may_ create another telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated. [CLS] [SEP] it is possible to log in to one telegram app with up to **3** different [accounts](https://telegram.org/blog/autoplay#multiple-account-support) at once. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i log out?

most users don't need to log out of telegram:

  * you can use telegram on many devices **at the same time**. [CLS] [SEP] just use the same phone number to log in on all devices. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you can go to _settings > data and storage > storage usage> clear cache_ to **free up space** on your device without logging out. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you use telegram with **multiple phone numbers** , you can [switch between accounts](https://telegram.org/blog/themes-accounts#multiple-accounts) without logging out. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you use telegram on a **shared device** , you can set up a passcode in _settings > privacy and security_ to make sure only you have access to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:

_ios_ : go to settings > edit > log out. [CLS] [SEP]  
 _android_ , _telegram desktop_ : go to settings > … (in the top right corner)
> log out. [CLS] [SEP]

if you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages. [CLS] [SEP] however, you **will
lose** all your **secret chats** and **all messages** inside those secret
chats when you log out. [CLS] [SEP]

> note that logging out does **not** trigger remote deletion of your secret
> chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'clear history'
> first. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i change my phone number?

you can change your number in telegram and keep **everything** , including all
your contacts, messages, and media from the telegram cloud, as well as all
your secret chats on all devices. [CLS] [SEP]

to change your number, go to settings, then tap on your phone number (just
above the username), then 'change number'. [CLS] [SEP] if you already have a different
telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account
first. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i delete my account?

if you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the [deactivation
page](https://telegram.org/deactivate). [CLS] [SEP] deleting your account permanently
removes all your **messages** and **contacts**. [CLS] [SEP] all groups and channels that
you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their
rights. [CLS] [SEP]

this action must be confirmed via your telegram account and cannot be undone. [CLS] [SEP]

> we recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process. [CLS] [SEP]  
> note that you'll receive the **code** via **telegram** , not sms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what happens if i delete my account?

as was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system:
all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be
deleted. [CLS] [SEP] that said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups
that you have created, and they will still have _their_ copy of the messages
you sent them. [CLS] [SEP] so if you want to send messages that can vanish without a
trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead. [CLS] [SEP]

termination of a telegram account is irreversible. [CLS] [SEP] if you sign up again, you
will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups
back. [CLS] [SEP] people, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified. [CLS] [SEP]
the new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages
list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how does account self-destruction work?

telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space
greatly. [CLS] [SEP] if you stop using telegram and don't come online for at least six
months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts
and every other piece of data you store in the telegram cloud. [CLS] [SEP] you can change
the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in
settings. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: my phone was stolen, what do i do?

first of all, sorry about your phone. [CLS] [SEP] unfortunately, the phone number is the
only way for us to identify a telegram user at the moment. [CLS] [SEP] we don't collect
additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account. [CLS] [SEP]
this means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number
or to telegram itself on any of your devices. [CLS] [SEP]

###### __i have access to telegram on another device

  1. [CLS] [SEP] go to telegram settings > privacy and security and turn on two-step verification. [CLS] [SEP] this way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] go to settings > devices (or privacy & security > active sessions) and terminate your telegram session on the old device. [CLS] [SEP] whoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] contact your phone provider, so that they block your old sim and issue a new one with your number. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] if you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to settings, tap on your phone number and change your telegram number to the new one. [CLS] [SEP]

###### __i don't have access to telegram on any other devices

  1. [CLS] [SEP] first and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old sim and issue a new one with your number. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] wait till you receive your new sim with the old number, log in to telegram, then go to settings > devices (or privacy & security > active sessions) and terminate your telegram session on the old device. [CLS] [SEP]

###### __removing sensitive data

common thieves usually throw out the sim card immediately (the phone is harder
to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much
risk for the data in case of regular petty theft. [CLS] [SEP] but if you have reasons to
worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device,
it is best that you wipe it remotely. [CLS] [SEP] you can read more about it here: [apple
ios](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2701),
[android](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager). [CLS] [SEP] unfortunately, this
requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario. [CLS] [SEP]

you can delete your telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of
your other devices (mobile or desktop). [CLS] [SEP] note that inactive telegram accounts
self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the
default setting. [CLS] [SEP]

### __bots

> if you're a developer, you may find our [bots
> faq](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq) more useful. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: what are bots?

bots are like small programs that run right inside telegram. [CLS] [SEP] they are made by
third-party developers using the [telegram bot
api](https://core.telegram.org/bots). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: how do i create a bot?

creating telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills
in computer programming. [CLS] [SEP] if you're sure you're up to it, our [**introduction
for developers**](https://core.telegram.org/bots) is a good place to start. [CLS] [SEP]

unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you
are not a developer. [CLS] [SEP] but we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by
other people to play with. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: a bot is sending me messages, how do i make it stop?

if you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as
you would block a human user. [CLS] [SEP] some telegram clients have a 'stop bot' button
right in the bot's profile. [CLS] [SEP]

that said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its
_/help_ for clues. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: are bots safe?

yes. [CLS] [SEP] bots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for
example. [CLS] [SEP] they can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and
they can see messages you send to them, that's it. [CLS] [SEP] they can't access your last
seen status and **don 't** see your phone number (unless you decide to give it
to them yourself). [CLS] [SEP]

naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your
passwords, telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely. [CLS] [SEP]
also, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with
ordinary humans. [CLS] [SEP] example: if a bot sent us a file called _openme.exe_ , we
probably wouldn't open it. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: if i add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?

bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups. [CLS] [SEP] by default, bots only
see messages that are meant for them. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, you'll see 'has no access
to messages' in the group members list next to the bot. [CLS] [SEP]

some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy
mode. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you
will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot. [CLS] [SEP]

[learn more about privacy mode for bots
»](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode)

if your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid
adding bots you don't trust 100%. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: are bots made by telegram?

no. [CLS] [SEP] while we have some official bots for specific purposes (like
[@gif](https://t.me/gif) or [@gdprbot](https://t.me/gdprbot)), we don't
usually make bots. [CLS] [SEP] bots are made by third-party developers using the [telegram
bot api and platform](https://core.telegram.org/bots). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: where can i find more bots?

there is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends
or search the web for now. [CLS] [SEP] we're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play
with. [CLS] [SEP]

### __deeper questions

#### __q: can i get telegram's server-side code?

all telegram client apps are fully open source. [CLS] [SEP] we offer [verifiable builds
both for ios and android](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds) –
this technology allows to independently verify that the application you
download from the app stores was built using the **exact same code** that we
publish. [CLS] [SEP]

by contrast, publishing the server code doesn’t provide security guarantees
neither for secret chats nor for cloud chats. [CLS] [SEP] this is because – unlike with
the client-side code – there’s no way to verify that the **same code** is run
on the servers. [CLS] [SEP]

as for secret chats, you don’t need the server-side code to check their
integrity – the point of end-to-end encryption is that it must be solid
regardless of how the servers function. [CLS] [SEP]

> in a [post on his channel](https://t.me/durov/146), pavel durov explained
> why telegram hasn't published the server code, even as a publicity stunt. [CLS] [SEP]

the [encryption](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and
[api](https://core.telegram.org) used on telegram's servers are fully
documented and open for review by security experts. [CLS] [SEP] we welcome any comments at
_security@telegram.org_

#### __q: can i run telegram using my own server?

our architecture does not support federation yet. [CLS] [SEP] telegram is a unified cloud
service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different
telegram clouds is unacceptable. [CLS] [SEP] to enable you to run your own telegram server
while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself. [CLS] [SEP] at the moment, we
are undecided on whether or not telegram should go in this direction. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i use the telegram api?

yes. [CLS] [SEP] developers for all platforms are welcome to use our
[protocol](//core.telegram.org/mtproto), [api](//core.telegram.org/api) and
even [source code](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code). [CLS] [SEP] check out the
[getting started](//core.telegram.org/api#getting-started) section of the
docs. [CLS] [SEP]

> don't forget about our [bot api](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that lets
> you build cool stuff on our platform. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: do you have a privacy policy?

sure. [CLS] [SEP] check [this](/privacy) out. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: why do you have two apps in the mac app store?

one is our [app for macos](https://macos.telegram.org), the other is telegram
lite, the macos version of our [multi-platform
client](https://desktop.telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP] both apps are official. [CLS] [SEP] both started
out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design
and functionality. [CLS] [SEP]

[telegram for macos](https://macos.telegram.org) supports many platform-
specific features, such as the macbook pro touch bar, gesture navigation,
integration with the mac's share menu and more. [CLS] [SEP] it has every feature from the
ios version of the app including secret chats. [CLS] [SEP]

[telegram lite](https://desktop.telegram.org) is a lightning-fast app,
optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities. [CLS] [SEP] it offers a
three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media,
files and links shared in your chats. [CLS] [SEP] this app can also be used to [export
your telegram data and chats](https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i translate telegram?

telegram is officially available in english, spanish, german, dutch, italian,
french, arabic, portuguese, korean, malay, russian and ukrainian on most
platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the
apps. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t like how a specific element in telegram's interface is translated
in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out
our [localization platform](https://translations.telegram.org). [CLS] [SEP] everyone can
suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making telegram localization
a community-driven effort. [CLS] [SEP]

if you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would
like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a
continuous basis, you can contact
[@telegramauditions](https://t.me/telegramauditions). [CLS] [SEP] please include a hashtag
with the english name of your language (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] #albanian) and a few links to
phrases on this platform with your **translation suggestions** or
**comments**. [CLS] [SEP] be sure read the [**style
guide**](https://translations.telegram.org/#style-guide) carefully before you
apply. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __q: can i help?

yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support. [CLS] [SEP] if you
would be interested in answering questions about telegram to users from your
country, contact our auditions account. [CLS] [SEP]

before you apply, please check out the [telegram support
initiative](https://core.telegram.org/tsi). [CLS] [SEP]

### __passport

**telegram passport** is a unified authorization method for services that
require personal identification. [CLS] [SEP] with telegram passport, you can upload your
documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require
real-world id (finance, icos, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the telegram cloud
using **end-to-end encryption**. [CLS] [SEP] to telegram, this data is just random
gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your telegram
passport. [CLS] [SEP] when you share data, it goes directly to the recipient. [CLS] [SEP]

> you can find more information about telegram passport on our
> [blog](https://telegram.org/blog/passport). [CLS] [SEP]

if you're a developer or owner of a service that requires real-life id, kindly
take a look at [**this manual**](https://core.telegram.org/passport). [CLS] [SEP] you can
also try requesting telegram passport data using [this
page](https://core.telegram.org/passport/example). [CLS] [SEP]

### __troubleshooting

#### __login and sms

please make sure you are entering your mobile phone number in the
international format. [CLS] [SEP]  
i.e.: `+(country code)(city or carrier code)(your number)`

if you are having registration or login problems, please contact us using
[this form](https://telegram.org/support). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __getting a code via a phone call

for security reasons, login codes dictated via a phone call are only available
for accounts that have **two-step verification** enabled (settings > privacy &
security > two-step verification). [CLS] [SEP]

please also note that telegram accounts can only be connected to a mobile
number. [CLS] [SEP] we currently don't support landline numbers. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __getting a code via telegram

if you have recently used one of our apps on **another device** (it could also
be a different app on the same device), we may send the login code **via
telegram** instead of sms. [CLS] [SEP]

to receive such a code, just check telegram from any of your connected
devices. [CLS] [SEP] you will find it in the chat with telegram, a verified profile with a
blue check:

[![](/file/811140682/1a34/c6cnb93sl4w.36331/8d856ce132fda22ee0)](/file/811140682/1a34/c6cnb93sl4w.36331/8d856ce132fda22ee0)

login code sent via telegram

**warning!** please note that getting codes via telegram should not be
considered an alternative to using an **up-to-date phone number**. [CLS] [SEP] in case of
a change in numbers, always make sure telegram is connected to a phone number
**you control** , otherwise you risk losing access to your account forever. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __notification problems

> if the tips below don't help, check out this detailed guide on
> [**troubleshooting notification issues**](https://telegra.ph/notifications-
> fix). [CLS] [SEP]

**android**

  1. [CLS] [SEP] go to telegram settings — notifications and sounds, make sure that notifications are **on** and importance is set to **“high”** or greater. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] check whether contact or group is _muted_. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] make sure [google play services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms) are installed on your phone. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] check **notification priority** for telegram in **android settings** , it can be called _importance_ or _behaviour_ depending on your device. [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] if your phone uses some **battery saving software** , make sure that telegram is whitelisted in that application. [CLS] [SEP]

> note: **huawei** and **xiaomi** devices have evil task killer services that
> interfere with the telegram notification service. [CLS] [SEP] for our notifications to
> work, you need to add telegram to allowed apps in those devices' security
> settings. [CLS] [SEP] huawei: phone manager app > protected apps > add telegram to the
> list. [CLS] [SEP] xiaomi: services > security > permissions > autostart, find telegram
> and enable autostart. [CLS] [SEP]

**ios**

  1. [CLS] [SEP] go to telegram settings — notifications and sounds, make sure that notifications are on in telegram. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] check that notifications are **on** in phone settings. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] check, whether contact or group is _muted_. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] shut down telegram (go to home screen, double tap home button, kill telegram (swipe upwards), then go to phone settings, set the alert style for telegram to none. [CLS] [SEP] relaunch telegram, go to phone settings, set alert style back to banners. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __problems with contacts

if you know your friends have telegram, but you can't see them — or they
appear as numbers instead of names. [CLS] [SEP]

_android:_

  1. [CLS] [SEP] make sure you are using the latest version of the app. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again). [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again). [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] if that didn't help, re-login. [CLS] [SEP] remember that logging out kills your secret chats. [CLS] [SEP]

_ios:_

  1. [CLS] [SEP] force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] if that doesn't help, temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again). [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] if that doesn’t work, re-login: settings > edit > log out. [CLS] [SEP] remember that logging out kills all your secret chats. [CLS] [SEP] then log in again. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __deleting contacts on android

to delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo
in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner >
'delete'. [CLS] [SEP]

if you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them
from your phone contacts. [CLS] [SEP] telegram stays in sync and will add the contact back
if you don't. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __where did my secret chat messages go?

secret chats are established between the two devices they were created on. [CLS] [SEP]
this means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot
be accessed on other devices. [CLS] [SEP]

moreover, secret chats are also tied to your current login session on the
device. [CLS] [SEP] if you log out and in again, you will lose all your secret chats. [CLS] [SEP]

#### __can't send messages to non-contacts

when users report unwanted messages from a telegram account, we apply a limit:
reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved
as a contact. [CLS] [SEP]

this means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them
annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

if you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit
[this page](/faq_spam). [CLS] [SEP]

#### __telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!

telegram can use the **microphone** in the background if you minimize the app
when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message. [CLS] [SEP]

permission monitors on samsung and xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify
you that telegram requested access to **camera** in the background. [CLS] [SEP] this
happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the
camera. [CLS] [SEP] unfortunately it may look the same to the samsung and xiaomi
permission monitors. [CLS] [SEP]

camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or
start recording a video or a video message. [CLS] [SEP] if you do this and quickly close
the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the
app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app
to show a notification about a new message. [CLS] [SEP] in any case, these requests are
only for the camera info, the app _never_ uses the camera itself in the
background. [CLS] [SEP]

anyone can check telegram’s [open source
code](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code) and confirm that the app is not
doing anything behind their back. [CLS] [SEP] we also offer [reproducible
builds](https://telegram.org/blog/verifiable-apps-and-more) that can help you
prove that the version you downloaded from app store or google play is built
from the exact same source code we publish. [CLS] [SEP]
