that violates this agreement in any way may result in the suspension or
termination of the visitor’s registration and access to the sites, at the
sites’ sole discretion, in addition to any other remedies. [CLS] [SEP] the sites may
provide interactive activities on a number of topics, but our staff or
volunteer hosts participating in these activities do not offer professional
advice of any kind and are speaking from their own experience or opinion as is
helpful for the facilitation of the dialogue. [CLS] [SEP] these hosts claim no
professional expertise or authority. [CLS] [SEP] we may also post additional guidelines
and/or a code of conduct for certain interactive areas or events. [CLS] [SEP] any
additional posted rules will be incorporated into this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] to the
extent there is a conflict between the rules of a specific event and this
agreement, the rules of the specific event will govern. [CLS] [SEP] if you see
objectionable content or have any questions about this agreement, please
[contact us](/contact). [CLS] [SEP]

policy of removing user submissions that violate copyright law, suspending

action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of
committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it
restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-
notice, at company’s discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
released party.”

  19. [CLS] [SEP] ## arbitration agreement

please read the following arbitration agreement carefully because it requires
you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with vox media, llc, and any of
its subsidiaries, affiliates, brands and entities that it controls, including
sb nation, the verge, polygon, curbed, eater, vox.com, recode, new york
magazine, daily intelligencer, grub street, select all, the cut, the
strategist, vulture and other affiliated sites (collectively “vox media,”
“we,” “us,” or “our”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from
us. [CLS] [SEP] both you and vox media acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any
dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these terms, vox
media’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors
(“personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these terms, and that upon your
acceptance of these terms, personnel will have the right (and will be deemed
to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as the third-
party beneficiary hereof. [CLS] [SEP]

### arbitration rules; applicability of arbitration agreement

the parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of
these terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a
precondition to either party initiating arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if such negotiations do
not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in
washington, dc, district of columbia. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will proceed in the
english language, in accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules
and procedures (the “rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial
contract disputes. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list
of jams arbitrators in accordance with such rules. [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award
rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

### costs of arbitration

the rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. [CLS] [SEP] vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] will
pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000)
dollars. [CLS] [SEP] vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in
arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]

### small claims court; infringement

either you or vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] may assert claims, if they qualify, in small
claims court in washington, dc, district of columbia or any united states
county where you live or work. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing
obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue
injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent
jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

### waiver of jury trial

you and vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to
court and have a trial in front of a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] you and vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP]
are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less
costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review
by a court. [CLS] [SEP] in any litigation between you and vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] over whether to
vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] waive all
rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
judge. [CLS] [SEP]

### waiver of class or consolidated actions

all claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be
arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis. [CLS] [SEP]
claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated
jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. [CLS] [SEP] if however,
this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or
unenforceable, neither you nor vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] is entitled to arbitration;
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in
(g) below. [CLS] [SEP]

include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or
telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement
that you want to opt out of these terms’ arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] notices sent
to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will
not be accepted or effective. [CLS] [SEP]

### exclusive venue

if you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the
foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] to
litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these
terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to
either party, and both you and vox media, inc. [CLS] [SEP] agree that any judicial
proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or
federal courts located in, respectively, washington, dc, district of columbia,
or the federal district in which that county falls. [CLS] [SEP]

### severability

if the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of
third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the
preceding language in this arbitration agreement section will be null and
void. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your
relationship with vox media, inc.. [CLS] [SEP]

not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. [CLS] [SEP] for users outside of
