# domain name registration agreement

**last revised: 10/21/2020**

**please read this agreement carefully, as it contains important information
regarding your legal rights and remedies.**

****1\. [CLS] [SEP] overview****

this domain name registration agreement (this " _agreement_ ") is entered into
by and between godaddy.com, llc, a delaware limited liability company
("godaddy") and you, and is made effective as of the date of electronic
acceptance. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of
godaddy's domain name registration services (the " _domain name registration
services_ " or the " _services_ "). [CLS] [SEP] the terms "we", "us" or "our" shall refer
to godaddy. [CLS] [SEP] the terms "you", "your", "user" or "customer" shall refer to any
individual or entity who accepts this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise specified,
nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or
benefits. [CLS] [SEP]

your electronic acceptance of this agreement signifies that you have read,
understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this agreement, which
incorporates by reference each of (i) godaddy’s [universal terms of service
agreement](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-
service-agreement) (" _utos_ "), (ii) all agreements, guidelines, policies,
practices, procedures, registration requirements or operational standards of
the top-level domain (" _tld_ ") in which you register any domain (“ _registry
policies_ ”), and (iii) any plan limits, product disclaimers or other
restrictions presented to you on the domain name registration services landing
page of the godaddy website (this “ _site_ ”). [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that (i) godaddy, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may change or modify this agreement, and any policies or

changes or modifications have been made shall constitute your acceptance of
this agreement as last revised. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to be bound by this

important that you keep your shopper account (“ _shopper account_ ”)

liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email notification
if such failure results from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address. [CLS] [SEP]

") accredited registrar. [CLS] [SEP]

you acknowledge and agree that godaddy may modify this agreement in order to
comply with any terms and conditions set forth by (i) icann and/or (ii) the
registry applicable to the tld or country code top level domain (" _cctld_ ")
in question. [CLS] [SEP] the term “registry service provider” shall refer to the service
provider responsible for operating and managing the registry services on
behalf of the registry operator for its applicable tld or cctld. [CLS] [SEP] to identify
the sponsoring registrar, click [here](http://www.internic.net/whois.html). [CLS] [SEP]

operator have vested and that the registry operator has relied on its third

[CLS] [SEP] in no event shall the registry operator be liable to you or any other person for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages, including loss of profit or goodwill, for any matter, whether such liability is asserted on the basis of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of warranties, either express or implied, any breach of this agreement or its incorporated agreements and policies your inability to use the domain name, your loss of data or files or otherwise, even if the registry operator has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

[CLS] [SEP]

****3\. [CLS] [SEP] fees and payments****

**(a) general terms, including automatic renewal terms**

you agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for services purchased or
obtained at this site at the time you order the services. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy expressly
reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and
such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this site and
effective immediately without need for further notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
purchased or obtained services for a period of months or years, changes or
modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the services in
question come up for renewal as further described below. [CLS] [SEP]

unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted in
section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any tld will be
the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a
domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if the list
price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified,
then the renewal price is also $9.99. [CLS] [SEP] likewise, if a domain name has a sale
price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at
$9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*. [CLS] [SEP]

* renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal. [CLS] [SEP]

for all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and
billing, etc. [CLS] [SEP] applicable to the services offered under the scope of this
agreement, please refer to the “fees and payments” section of our [universal
terms of service](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-
service-agreement). [CLS] [SEP]

**(b) domain name renewal terms_**

when you register a domain name, you will have the following renewal options:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] **automatic renewal.** automatic renewal is the default setting. [CLS] [SEP] domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, and payment will be taken from the payment method you have on file with godaddy, at godaddy's then current rates. [CLS] [SEP] thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, godaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year. [CLS] [SEP] if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, godaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from your original term, as of 16 july 2020, you may manually renew the domain registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] **manual renewal.** if you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date by logging into your [account manager](https://account.godaddy.com) and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name. [CLS] [SEP]

all renewals will be subject to the terms of this agreement, as it may be
amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains. [CLS] [SEP] domain name
renewals will be non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that we are unable to
automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any
reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than
your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction
to succeed. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason godaddy is not able to take the payment from the
payment method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your
domain name registration will expire. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to keep your
payment method information current, which includes the expiration date if you
are using a credit card. [CLS] [SEP]

for certain cctlds (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn,
.de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz,
.tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will
occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration. [CLS] [SEP]

for certain cctlds (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de,
.eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc,
.tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal will occur, or
must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the
20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be
placed in non-renewal status. [CLS] [SEP] for some cctlds (.es) renewal must be processed
no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will
be placed in non-renewal status. [CLS] [SEP] when the domain name is in non-renewal
status, you can renew the domain name only by calling godaddy and requesting
that the domain name be renewed. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot renew the domain name through your
[account manager](https://account.godaddy.com). [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to manually
implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the
domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that godaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that
you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] in any case,
if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges
may apply. [CLS] [SEP] if you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or
any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services
will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for
renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you
cancel in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

if you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this
agreement, you agree that godaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your
expired domain name on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if godaddy decides to renew your expired
domain name on your behalf, you will have a renewal grace period during which
you must reimburse godaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name. [CLS] [SEP] the
renewal grace period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under
the terms of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

for certain cctlds (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu,
.fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk,
.tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no renewal grace period
after the expiration date of the domain name. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not reimburse godaddy
for the renewal during the renewal grace period your domain name will be
placed on hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a
30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain
name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay godaddy
a redemption fee. [CLS] [SEP]

the redemption fee is currently $80.00 usd and is subject to change under the
terms of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not redeem your domain name prior to the
end of the 30-day redemption period godaddy may, in its sole discretion,
delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]
during the redemption period your domain name may be parked. [CLS] [SEP]

if your domain name is deleted, the registry also provides a 30-day redemption
grace period during which you may pay godaddy a redemption fee and redeem your
domain name. [CLS] [SEP] the redemption fee is currently $80.00 usd and is subject to
change under the terms of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not redeem your domain
name prior to the end of the registry's redemption grace period the registry
will release your name and it will become available for registration on a
first-come-first-served basis. [CLS] [SEP]

renewal grace periods and redemption grace periods vary for different cctlds. [CLS] [SEP]
please refer to the specific terms for the applicable tld. [CLS] [SEP] in the event there
is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the cctld terms,
the cctld terms shall control. [CLS] [SEP]

our registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are
described [here](https://www.godaddy.com/help/expired-registration-recovery-
policy-errp-compliance-statement-8803). [CLS] [SEP]

**(c) free product terms**

in the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a
domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be
available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain
name is deleted or cancelled. [CLS] [SEP] for free domain names, you acknowledge and agree
that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the
first five (5) days after registration. [CLS] [SEP] in the event a free domain name is
offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name
registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the
registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount
paid and the value of the free domain. [CLS] [SEP] failed registrations associated with
promotional offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item
or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the
discounted item, in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

****4\. [CLS] [SEP] term of agreement; transfers; domain tasting** **

the term of this agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as
you have any domain name registered through godaddy. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through
godaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days
after its initial registration date. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you may not transfer any
domain name for ten (10) days after a change of account. [CLS] [SEP]

you further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the
five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain
name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the
marketability or viability of a domain name. [CLS] [SEP] if godaddy determines (which
determination shall be made by godaddy in its sole and absolute discretion)
that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then godaddy reserves the
right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any
refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. [CLS] [SEP]
godaddy will not charge you a fee if godaddy cancels your domain name during
the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your
control. [CLS] [SEP] the five (5) day grace period does not apply to premium domains,
which are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that godaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by
third parties who you may use to purchase services from godaddy, or (ii) any
statements of a general nature, which may be posted on godaddy's website or

****5\. [CLS] [SEP] up to date information; use of information and expiration****

you agree to notify godaddy within five (5) business days when any of the
information you provided as part of the application and/or registration
process changes. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to keep this information in a
current and accurate status. [CLS] [SEP] failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide
godaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual
basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this agreement and a
basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. [CLS] [SEP] failure by you,
for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries
made by godaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you,
shall also be considered to be a material breach of this agreement and a basis
for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to retain a
copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that for each domain name registered by you, the following contact
data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number, and if
available, a facsimile number for the registered name holder and, if different

you acknowledge and agree that domain name registration requires that your
contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the registry
operator, for their use, copying, distribution, publication, modification and
other processing for the purpose of administration of the domain name
registration, which may require such information be transferred back and forth
across international borders, to and from the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] to the eu, for example. [CLS] [SEP] as

godaddy's control. [CLS] [SEP]

both godaddy and the registry operator may be required to archive this
information with a third-party escrow service. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby consent and give
permission for all such requirements and disclosures. [CLS] [SEP] further, you represent
and warrant that, if you are providing information about a third party, you
have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the
disclosure and you have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]
registrar will not process data in a way that is incompatible with this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] registrar will take reasonable precautions to protect data from
loss or misuse. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that for each domain name registered by you the following

    * name of primary name server and secondary name server,
    * identity of the registrar. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that, to the extent permitted by icann, godaddy may make use of the
publicly available information you provided during the registration process. [CLS] [SEP]
if you engage in the reselling of domain names you agree to provide any
individuals whose personal information you've obtained, information about the
possible uses of their personal information pursuant to icann policy. [CLS] [SEP] you also
agree to obtain consent, and evidence of consent, from those individuals for
such use of the personal information they provide. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that godaddy has the right to make public and share with third
parties certain information in connection with the sale or purchase of domain
names on the website, including but not limited to (a) the name of the domain
name sold or purchased, (b) the sale or purchase price of the domain name sold
or purchased, and (c) information relating to the timing of the sale or
purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

in order for us to comply with any current or future rules and policies for
domain name systems including any rules or policies established by the cira or
any provincial or federal government or by other organization having control
or authority to establish rules or policies, you hereby grant to us the right
to disclose to third parties through an interactive publicly accessible
registration database the following information that you are required to
provide when applying for a domain name:  

    1. [CLS] [SEP] the domain or sub-domain name(s) registered by you;
    2. [CLS] [SEP] your organization name, type and postal address;
    3. [CLS] [SEP] the name(s), position(s), postal address(es), e-mail address(es), voice telephone number(s) and where available the fax number(s) of the technical and administrative contacts for your domain or sub-domain name(s);

    5. [CLS] [SEP] the corresponding names of those name servers;
    6. [CLS] [SEP] the original creation date of the registration; and
    7. [CLS] [SEP] the expiration date of the registration. [CLS] [SEP]

we may be required to make this information available in bulk form to third
parties. [CLS] [SEP] we may also transfer or assign this information to cira or such other
third party as we may decide, in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

****6\. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution policy****

you agree to be bound by our current dispute resolution policy. [CLS] [SEP] this policy is
incorporated herein and made a part of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you can view the
[uniform domain name dispute resolution
policy](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/domain-name-dispute-
resolution-policy) online. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that godaddy may from time to time modify
its dispute resolution policy. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy will post any changes to its dispute
resolution policy at least thirty (30) days before they become effective. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree that by maintaining your domain name registrations with godaddy after
the updated policy becomes effective that you agree to the dispute resolution
policy as amended. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to review godaddy's website periodically to
determine if changes have been made to the dispute resolution policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you
cancel or terminate your services with godaddy as a result of the modified
dispute resolution policy, no fees will be refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to
submit to proceedings commenced under icann's uniform rapid suspension system,
if applicable. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that if a dispute arises as a result of one (1) or more domain names
you have registered using godaddy, you will indemnify, defend and hold godaddy
harmless as provided for in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that if godaddy is
notified that a complaint has been filed with a governmental, administrative
or judicial body, regarding a domain name registered by you using godaddy,
that godaddy, in its sole discretion, may take whatever action godaddy deems
necessary regarding further modification, assignment of and/or control of the
domain name deemed necessary to comply with the actions or requirements of the
governmental, administrative or judicial body until such time as the dispute
is settled. [CLS] [SEP] in this event you agree to hold godaddy harmless for any action
taken by godaddy. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable
jurisdictions, to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of your domicile, (2)
where registrar is located or (3) where the registry operator is located
(e.g., china for .cn, columbia for .co, uk for .eu, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

in the case of .ca domain names, you agree that, if your use of the service or
the registration of a .ca domain name is challenged by a third party, you will
be subject to the provisions specified by cira in their dispute resolution
policy, in effect at the time of the dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

****7\. [CLS] [SEP] transfer of domain names****

if you transfer any domain name, you agree to provide the information required
by, and to abide by, the procedures and conditions set forth in our [domain
name transfer agreement](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/domain-name-
transfer-agreement) and [change of registrant
agreement](https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/change-of-registrant-
agreement). [CLS] [SEP] you may view the latest versions of our domain name transfer
agreement and change of registrant agreement online. [CLS] [SEP] in order to further
protect your domain name, any domain name registered with godaddy or
transferred to godaddy shall be placed on lock status, unless an opted-out has
occurred as defined in our change of registrant agreement or domain name proxy
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the domain name must be placed on unlock status in order to
initiate a transfer of the domain name away from godaddy to a new registrar. [CLS] [SEP]
you may log into your account with godaddy at any time after your domain name
has been successfully transferred to godaddy, and change the status to unlock. [CLS] [SEP]

****8\. [CLS] [SEP] your obligations; suspension of services; breach of agreement****

you represent and warrant to the best of your knowledge that, neither the
registration of the domain nor the manner it is directly or indirectly used,
infringes the legal rights of any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you will comply with all
applicable laws, including, but not limited to those relating to privacy, data
collection, consumer protection, fair lending, debt collection, organic
farming, and disclosure of data and financial disclosures. [CLS] [SEP] if you collect and
maintain sensitive health and financial data, you must implement reasonable
and appropriate security measures commensurate with the offering of those
services, as defined by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] you represent that you possess any
necessary authorization, charter, license, and/or other related credential for
participation in the sector associated with the associated registry tld
string. [CLS] [SEP] you will report any material changes to the validity of your
authorization, charter, license, and/or other related credential. [CLS] [SEP] you will
indemnify and hold harmless the registrar and registry operator, and their
directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against any and all
claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) arising out of or related to the domain name registration. [CLS] [SEP]
this obligation shall survive expiration or termination of this agreement or
the domain name registration. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that, in addition to other events set forth in this agreement:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] your ability to use any of the services provided by godaddy is subject to cancellation or suspension in the event there is an unresolved breach of this agreement and/or suspension or cancellation is required by any policy now in effect or adopted later by icann;
    2. [CLS] [SEP] your registration of any domain names shall be subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer pursuant to any icann adopted specification or policy, or pursuant to any godaddy procedure not inconsistent with an icann adopted specification or policy (a) to correct mistakes by godaddy or the registry operator in registering any domain name; or (b) for the resolution of disputes concerning any domain name. [CLS] [SEP]

  
you acknowledge and agree that godaddy and registry reserve the right to deny,
cancel or transfer any registration or transaction, or place any domain
name(s) on lock, hold or similar status, as either deems necessary, in the
unlimited and sole discretion of either godaddy or the registry: (i) to comply
with specifications adopted by any industry group generally recognized as
authoritative with respect to the internet (e.g., rfcs), (ii) to protect the
integrity and stability of, and correct mistakes made by, any domain name
registry or registrar, (iii) for the non-payment of fees to registry, (iv) to
protect the integrity and stability of the registry, (v) to comply with any
applicable court orders, laws, government rules or requirements, requests of
law enforcement, or any dispute resolution process, (vi) to comply with any
applicable icann rules or regulations, including without limitation, the
registry agreement, (vii) to avoid any liability, civil or criminal, on the
part of registry operator, as well as its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers,
directors, and employees, (viii) per the terms of this agreement, (ix)
following an occurrence of any of the prohibited activities described in
section 8 below, or (x) during the resolution of a dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that your failure to comply completely with the terms and conditions
of this agreement and any godaddy rule or policy may be considered by godaddy
to be a material breach of this agreement and godaddy may provide you with
notice of such breach either in writing or electronically (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] email). [CLS] [SEP] in the
event you do not provide godaddy with material evidence that you have not
breached your obligations to godaddy within ten (10) business days, godaddy
may terminate its relationship with you and take any remedial action available
to godaddy under the applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] such remedial action may be implemented
without notice to you and may include, but is not limited to, cancelling the
registration of any of your domain names and discontinuing any services
provided by godaddy to you. [CLS] [SEP] no fees will be refunded to you should your
services be cancelled or terminated because of a breach. [CLS] [SEP]

godaddy's failure to act upon or notify you of any event, which may constitute
a breach, shall not relieve you from or excuse you of the fact that you have
committed a breach. [CLS] [SEP]

****9\. [CLS] [SEP] restriction of services; right of refusal****

if you are hosting your domain name system (“ _dns_ ”) on godaddy’s servers,
or are using our systems to forward a domain name, url, or otherwise to a
system or site hosted elsewhere, or if you have your domain name registered
with godaddy, you are responsible for ensuring there is no excessive
overloading on godaddy’s servers. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use godaddy’s servers and your
domain name as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination
address for mail bombs, internet packet flooding, packet corruption, or other
abusive attack. [CLS] [SEP] server hacking or other perpetration of security breaches is
prohibited. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that godaddy reserves the right to deactivate your
domain name from its dns if godaddy deems it is the recipient of activities
caused by your site that threaten the stability of its network. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that godaddy, in its sole discretion and without liability to you,
may refuse to accept the registration of any domain name. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy also may in
its sole discretion and without liability to you delete the registration of
any domain name during the first thirty (30) days after registration has taken
place. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event godaddy refuses a registration or deletes an existing
registration during the first thirty (30) days after registration, you will
receive a refund of any fees paid to godaddy in connection with the
registration either being cancelled or refused. [CLS] [SEP] in the event godaddy deletes
the registration of a domain name being used in association with spam or
morally objectionable activities, no refund will be issued. [CLS] [SEP]

****10\. [CLS] [SEP] default settings; parked page****

_choosing your domain name settings._ when you register a domain name with
godaddy, you will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the
checkout process. [CLS] [SEP] if you plan on using another provider for your website or
hosting needs, then you should enter the name servers of such provider when
you choose your domain name settings. [CLS] [SEP] this will direct your domain name away
from godaddy’s name servers. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an existing godaddy customer and have
already set up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for
new domain name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again
during the checkout process. [CLS] [SEP]

_godaddy’s default settings._ if you do not direct your domain name away from
godaddy’s name servers as described above, godaddy will direct your domain
name to a “ _parked page_ ” (“ _default setting_ ”). [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree
that godaddy has the right to set the default setting. [CLS] [SEP]

_parked page default setting._ godaddy's parked page service is an online
domain monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of
pay per click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used
as websites. [CLS] [SEP] if your domain name is directed to a parked page, you acknowledge
and agree that godaddy may display both (a) in-house advertising (which
includes links to godaddy products and services) and (b) third-party
advertising (which includes links to third-party products and services) on
your parked page through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows,
banner advertisements, audio or video streams, or any other advertising means,
and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies
and other similar means. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-
house and third-party advertising will be selected by godaddy and its
advertising partners, as appropriate, and you will not be permitted to
customize the advertising, or entitled to any compensation in exchange
therefor. [CLS] [SEP] please note that the third-party advertising displayed on godaddy’s
parked pages may contain content offensive to you, including but not limited
to links to adult content. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy makes no effort to edit, control, monitor,
or restrict the content and third-party advertising displayed on godaddy’s
parked pages, and expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility to you
or any third party in connection therewith. [CLS] [SEP]

_changing godaddy’s default settings._ you may change godaddy’s default
settings at any time during the term of your domain name registration. [CLS] [SEP]

    1. [CLS] [SEP] _content displaying on your parked page._ you can not modify the content displaying on your parked page. [CLS] [SEP] you may select one of the other options listed below. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP] _participating in domain name monetization._ if you wish to participate in the domain monetization potential presented by godaddy’s parked page service, please review and consider purchasing our cashparking® service. [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] _no content._ if the options listed above are not acceptable to you, please contact customer support to learn what other options might be available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_return to parked page default setting upon domain name expiration._ upon
domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during
the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically
return to the parked page default setting described above. [CLS] [SEP] as used in this
paragraph, “expiration” is deemed to include any “renewal period” or
“redemption period” immediately after the domain name expires, but before the
domain name is returned to the registry. [CLS] [SEP] once your domain name has returned to
the parked page default setting described above, the only way to opt out of
the parked page service is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name
in accordance with section 2(b), domain name renewal terms, of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

****11\. [CLS] [SEP] domain add-ons****

**business registration** : business registration allows you to display
additional information about the business that is the basis of your domain
name, including, but not limited to, such information as your fax number,
street address, and hours of operation. [CLS] [SEP]

**expiration consolidation.** you understand and acknowledge the expiration
consolidation service may only be used to consolidate the expiration of .com
and .net domain names. [CLS] [SEP] the service may not be used to consolidate domains that
are on registrar hold, registry hold, or pending transfer status. [CLS] [SEP] you
acknowledge the service may only be used to push the expiration date of your
domains forward in time, at least one (1) month forward and no more than ten
(10) years forward, and then, only for a period lasting less than twelve (12)
months. [CLS] [SEP] once the service has been used to consolidate domains, the new
expiration date may not be reversed. [CLS] [SEP] to ensure the service is not abused or
used as an alternative to renewals, you may only use the service on each
domain once in any 12-month period. [CLS] [SEP] the service may only be used on domain
names that have not passed their expiration date. [CLS] [SEP] in order to change the
expiration date again, you will be required to renew the domain name first. [CLS] [SEP]
you further understand and acknowledge the service may only be used to
coordinate domains where we are the registrar of record. [CLS] [SEP] domains not
registered with us must be transferred before we can perform the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**discount domain club.** in exchange for purchasing a discount domain club
membership, you will be able to purchase discounted products and services from
us, including discounts on selected domain registrations, one (1) free
auctions account, one (1) free cashparking account, and discounts on domain
buy service. [CLS] [SEP] you are required to keep your membership current as long as you
have free or discounted products or services that are purchased with us. [CLS] [SEP] if
you fail to renew your membership, without canceling your discounted domain
registration or other services, we will automatically renew your products and
services at the regular pricing in effect at the time of renewal, charging the
payment method on file for you, and you will be unable to purchase any more
discounted products or services, or use your free accounts until the
membership agreement fee has been paid. [CLS] [SEP] all membership fees are non-
refundable. [CLS] [SEP]

**backordering/monitoring.** you agree a domain name that has expired shall be
subject first to a grace period of twelve (12) days, followed by the icann-
mandated redemption grace period of thirty (30) days. [CLS] [SEP] during this period of
time, the current domain name registrant may renew the domain name and retain
registration rights. [CLS] [SEP] we do not guarantee your backorder will result in you
obtaining the domain name and expressly reserves the right to (a) refuse
additional backorders or (b) cancel existing backorders at any time for any
reason. [CLS] [SEP] if your backorder is refused or cancelled, we agree to promptly refund
any fees paid for such domain name backorder. [CLS] [SEP] the domain name may also be
placed in a secondary market for resale through the auctions® service. [CLS] [SEP] after
your first year of auctions membership, you agree that unless otherwise
advised, we will automatically renew your auctions membership using the
payment method you have on file for so long as your backorder credit is
active. [CLS] [SEP] you may learn more about auctions by visiting the auctions website. [CLS] [SEP]
the domain name may also be subject to a drop pool process before it is
available for purchasing. [CLS] [SEP] you understand we and our registrar affiliates use
our services, including backordering. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, the domain name may be
registered with a different registrar, but can be managed through your
account. [CLS] [SEP] by using the services, you will be able to, among other things:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] backorder any domain name under the top level domains .com, .net, .us, .biz, .info, .org, .mobi. [CLS] [SEP] a backorder for a domain name will include the price of up to a one-year domain name registration. [CLS] [SEP] should you successfully backorder any domain name, you will be subject to the terms and conditions of the domain name registration and related agreements, which are incorporated herein by reference. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP] change your backorder until you obtain a domain name. [CLS] [SEP] you will have the opportunity to change the credit to a different domain name until you successfully capture one. [CLS] [SEP] after three (3) years, if the credit is not used, we reserves the right to remove the credit. [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] subscribe monthly to an expiring domain name list. [CLS] [SEP] you may also choose to purchase a subscription to a list of domain names expiring within the next five (5) days. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribe to the expiring domain name list, you agree the payment method you have on file may be charged on a monthly subscription basis for the term of the services you purchase. [CLS] [SEP]
    4. [CLS] [SEP] select domain names off the expiring domain name list you would like to register. [CLS] [SEP] each domain name you attempt to backorder will include the price of up to a one-year domain name registration, as set forth in subsection (i) above. [CLS] [SEP]
    5. [CLS] [SEP] monitor your currently registered domain names for changes in registrar, status, expiration date or name servers at no additional cost. [CLS] [SEP]
    6. [CLS] [SEP] subscribe to domain alert pro or monitoring, which enables you to monitor any currently registered domain name, regardless of registrar, for historical tracking of status changes and designation of multiple email notification addresses. [CLS] [SEP]

**domain ownership protection**. [CLS] [SEP] domain ownership protection generally allows
you to: (i) prevent accidental loss of a domain name due to an expired credit
card or invalid payment method for a period of ninety (90) days before the
domain goes through its normal expiration process; and (ii) lock your domain
name to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

the service will not, however, prevent transfers resulting from your action of
listing your domain for sale on any of godaddy's platforms, including premium
listings, regardless of when you purchased the service. [CLS] [SEP]

once you have elected to purchase the service for any and all domain names,
the automatic renewal function will be activated for each domain name and
those names will not be transferable until you elect to remove the service or
sell the domain as mentioned above. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, you acknowledge and agree you
have carefully considered the implications accompanying the purchase of the
service and understand the restrictions the service will place upon your
ability to transfer any domains for which you have purchased the service. [CLS] [SEP]
furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that the service includes additional
steps to verify your ownership prior to deactivation. [CLS] [SEP] while you can elect to
deactivate the service at any time, you also acknowledge and agree that the
service is subject to our refund policy, and that you may not be entitled to a
refund. [CLS] [SEP]

**premium domain listing and buying services.**

    1. [CLS] [SEP] **description of service.** the premium domain listing and buying service (“service”) is provided to facilitate the buying and selling of currently registered domain names only, and not the purchase or sale of associated website content.. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy provides a venue and a transaction facilitation process and will take a stated commission for each completed transaction. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy is not an escrow agent. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, godaddy does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of many of the domain names. [CLS] [SEP] domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by us. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that your transaction will be handled by godaddy's “transaction assurance” process. [CLS] [SEP] by using godaddy's “transaction assurance” process, you authorize godaddy to perform tasks on your behalf in order to complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] in these transactions, godaddy acts as a transaction facilitator to help you buy and sell domain names. [CLS] [SEP] godaddy will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge godaddy is not a bank and the service is a payment processing service rather than a banking service. [CLS] [SEP] you further acknowledge godaddy is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds. [CLS] [SEP] in all transactions, where the domain name is registered to us, domain names purchased through the service may not be transferred away from us to another registrar for a period of sixty (60) days following the change of registrant date. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] **your obligations.**  
  
 **listing domain names.** you may use the services to list domain names to
which you: (i) have registration rights for sale; and (ii) are able to
transfer in accordance with your obligations under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] by using
the services for such purposes, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have
all rights, titles and interests in the domain name necessary to complete the
transaction; (ii) the domain name does not infringe on the intellectual
property rights of anyone else; (iii) you have the right to transfer the
domain name in accordance with your obligations under this agreement; and (iv)
any domain ownership protection service that is present on the domain will not
prevent you from listing the domain name and having its registration rights
transferred away from you. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you further agree the domain name is not currently or will not in the
foreseeable future be associated with a uniform dispute resolution policy
dispute or other such litigation. [CLS] [SEP] in the event you are unable to comply or
fail to comply with your obligations under this agreement, we expressly
reserve the right to delist any or all of your domain names immediately upon
becoming aware of your failure to comply. [CLS] [SEP] you may list your domain name for
any duration offered on the web site. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to pay the listing fee
associated with the duration period you choose at the time of the listing. [CLS] [SEP] you
may choose to supplement the listing with various additional services
provided, if any. [CLS] [SEP] by using the additional services, you agree to pay any
additional charges we may associate with the additional services. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve
the right to modify its pricing structure at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if you find a buyer
using the services, the transaction must be completed within the services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
for each transaction completed within the services, you agree to pay us a
transaction fee according to the fee schedule published on the site. [CLS] [SEP] such
transaction fee will be payable directly to us. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to sell the
domain name to any buyer found through the services without using the services
to complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] should we find you are circumventing the
services, we reserve the right to terminate your account and cancel all of
your listings. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you update your sale price, you acknowledge
and agree that it may take up to 24 hours to update the price shown to buyers. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event your domain name sells prior to the price being updated on the
website, you agree that the price listed will be enforced. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **purchasing domain names.** as a buyer, you are obligated to complete the
transaction if you purchase the domain name. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that some listed
domain names may be subject to an additional registration fee. [CLS] [SEP] for those

availability (defined below). [CLS] [SEP] you shall receive service credits for any outage
(defined below) of the service covered by the service uptime guarantee. [CLS] [SEP] the
service credits shall be applied as extensions to the terms of the affected
service. [CLS] [SEP] the service uptime guarantee shall become effective fourteen (14)
days after your purchase of the service covered by the service uptime
guarantee to allow both parties time to properly configure and test the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

__definitions.__ for the purposes of the service uptime guarantee, the
following definitions shall apply:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] _“global nameserver infrastructure”_ : the group of systems (servers, hardware, and associated software) that are responsible for delivering the services. [CLS] [SEP] the global nameserver infrastructure does not include web-based user interfaces, zone transfer mechanisms, update systems, or other customer-accessible data access or manipulation methods. [CLS] [SEP]
    2. [CLS] [SEP] _“99.999% availability”_ : a guarantee that the global nameserver infrastructure shall be available to respond to dns queries 99.999% of the time. [CLS] [SEP]
    3. [CLS] [SEP] _“outage”_ : a period in which the global nameserver infrastructure did not maintain 99.999% availability. [CLS] [SEP]

__exclusions__. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of the service uptime guarantee, downtime due
to the following events shall not be considered an outage:

    1. [CLS] [SEP] service interruptions caused by “ _regularly scheduled maintenance_ ”, which shall be defined as any maintenance performed on the global nameserver infrastructure of which customer is notified twenty-four (24) hours in advance. [CLS] [SEP] email notice of regularly scheduled maintenance shall be provided to customer’s designated email address;

    5. [CLS] [SEP] service interruptions beyond the reasonable control of us or that are not reasonably foreseeable by us, including, but not limited to, power outages, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, network congestion or other failures. [CLS] [SEP]

we, in our sole and absolute discretion, shall determine whether an event
shall be considered an outage. [CLS] [SEP]

__remedies__. [CLS] [SEP] for the purposes of the service uptime guarantee, when the

service uptime guarantee. [CLS] [SEP]

to qualify for a service credit, you must have a current and valid
subscription to the services affected, and must have an account in good
standing with us. [CLS] [SEP] service credits will not apply to any charges or services
other than the services for which the service uptime guarantee was not met. [CLS] [SEP]
customers with subscriptions for more than one service will not receive
credits for unaffected services. [CLS] [SEP] the remedies set forth herein shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies if we do not meet the service uptime guarantee. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event either party is unable to carry out its material obligations
under this agreement by reason of force majeure those obligations will be
suspended during the continuance of the force majeure, provided the cause of
the force majeure is remedied as quickly as practicable. [CLS] [SEP] the term “ _force

responsibility regarding the same. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, dnssec responses are
authenticated, but not encrypted. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that dnssec does
not provide confidentiality of data, and we assume no liability or
responsibility regarding the same. [CLS] [SEP]

recursive dns services and reserves the right to remove any servers from the
network that violate this restriction. [CLS] [SEP]

government; or (ii) you notify us of your intent to cancel for any reason
within the first five (5) days after the registration (i.e., after it is
deemed permissible by the chinese government). [CLS] [SEP] for the avoidance of doubt,
refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances after five (5) days from
the date of registration, including, for example, in the event real name
verification is not successful or if the chinese government determines after
registration that the domain name should not have been registered (and directs
us to delete). [CLS] [SEP]

**_(d) provisions specific to .jp registrations_**  
__registration restrictions__. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you have a local

names are reserved and can only be registered by certain parties. [CLS] [SEP] these
include: (i) tlds, other than cctlds, as determined by icann; (ii)
geographical-type .jp domain names that are defined as metropolitan,
prefectural, and municipal labels; (iii) names of primary and secondary
educational organizations; (iv) names of organizations related to internet
management; (v) names required for .jp domain name operations; and (vi)
character strings which may be confused with ascii-converted japanese domain
