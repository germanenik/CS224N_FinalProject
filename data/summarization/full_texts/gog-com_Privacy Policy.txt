also collect technical logs, information about achievements in games you play
and how long you play them; your multiplayer sessions and your activities in
the gog galaxy app and on other platforms connected to your gog account for
the general operational purposes of gog galaxy. [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to connect your

about your activity (specific examples opposite). [CLS] [SEP] we need this to run gog
galaxy and to provide you with its cool features. [CLS] [SEP]

4.5 a quick word about bug reports and crash logs: gog software will generate
bug or crash reports regarding gog services – these reports will not mention
your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] you can decide whether to submit these reports to
gog automatically. [CLS] [SEP] if you manually submit bug or crash reports to us, or if we
contact you asking for feedback regarding crash or bug reports, then we may
store them alongside your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

if gog services crash, we might ask you to send us crash logs/bug reports. [CLS] [SEP]

this is a matter for the relevant payment method/platform/processor. [CLS] [SEP] we
process only limited payment processing information on a hashed/anonymised

are notified by the payment processor once a transaction takes place and of
course we make sure you receive your purchased item, but we will not receive
any of your actual payment details. [CLS] [SEP]

[here](https://support.gog.com/hc/fr/articles/115000498685-politique-des-
cookies). [CLS] [SEP] the cookie policy forms part of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

read our cookie policy too (link opposite). [CLS] [SEP]

### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] why do we use your data? (legal grounds for data processing)

7.1. [CLS] [SEP] when we process information about you, we do so as necessary to provide
gog services you use (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] to perform agreement between us, enable you to play
gwent or use gog galaxy features), meet our legal obligations (f.ex. [CLS] [SEP] tax,
accounting) or to fulfill the so-called “legitimate interests” of gog or other
reasons described in the “how we use your data” section. [CLS] [SEP] to clarify, by
legitimate interests we mean lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected
(like informing you about games we distribute and making sure our marketing is
relevant for you, protecting the security of our websites and systems,
conducting anti-cheat analysis and anti-fraud checks). [CLS] [SEP] when we rely on the
legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and
your rights. [CLS] [SEP] for other purposes we will ask for your consent and you will be
entitled to withdraw this consent any time, with no impact on the validity of
the processing before your consent has been withdrawn. [CLS] [SEP]

in essence, we process your data to provide you with gog services, to meet our
legal obligations and for other reasons that are important for us like
informing you about our games and ensuring security of our website. [CLS] [SEP] in other
cases, we will ask for your consent in advance and you will always have the
right to withdraw it anytime you like. [CLS] [SEP]

7.2 when we transfer your data outside of the european economic area, we do so
on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “trusted
partners”. [CLS] [SEP]  
  

### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] how we handle your information

8.1 all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those
of our trusted partners. [CLS] [SEP] we implement appropriate technical and organisational
measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful
processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. [CLS] [SEP]

all information you provide to us is stored either on our secure servers or
those of our trusted partners. [CLS] [SEP]

8.2 how long are we going to keep your data? we will retain your personal
information only for as long as we will be required in order to fulfil the
purposes outlined in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] in certain special cases, a longer
retention period might be required by law e.g. [CLS] [SEP] tax, accounting purposes or
other legal requirements and obligations. [CLS] [SEP] as soon as we will no longer require
your personal data to provide our services for other purposes mentioned above,
we will promptly delete or anonymize it. [CLS] [SEP] in particular:

  * (a) we will keep information that is associated with your gog account for the duration of your agreement for the access to gog services (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] until you close your gog account). [CLS] [SEP] if you choose to close your gog account, limited data that we collect about you may still be retained for tax, legal and accounting purposes;
  * (b) if you don’t have a gog account and contact us we will retain correspondence with you as long as necessary to help you out and then for the period necessary for legal or accountability purposes;
  * (c) information that you post on our public forums and your game reviews will be retained until you decide that it should be removed as well. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t want to interfere with your posts and expressions without your permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * (d) we will keep data that is associated with your gwent account for the duration of the agreement to access gwent services (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] until you close your gwent account). [CLS] [SEP] following account closure, limited data that we collect about you will still be retained for an additional few years for tax, legal and accounting purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * (e) if you use gog galaxy and connect your accounts from other platforms with gog galaxy we’ll be storing your imported data only as long as you stay connected with the relevant platform. [CLS] [SEP] this information will be deleted once you disconnect with the platform or anytime you ask us to delete your data. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you purchased any content via gog galaxy store, we will need to retain your payment history, product id and entitlement id for tax, legal and accounting purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

in general, we’ll store your data until you close your gog account (or gwent
account if applicable). [CLS] [SEP] if you do, we may still use limited information about
you for tax, legal or accounting purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

legal situation. [CLS] [SEP] if you decide that you no longer want to receive personalized
offers, product recommendations from us, or no advertising news at all, you
can object to this at any time. [CLS] [SEP] you can also choose whether to receive
marketing communication from us, including personalized and targeted marketing
emails by managing subscriptions on your gog account subscription page,
following the link "unsubscribe" attached to our marketing emails or just
contacting us directly here. [CLS] [SEP]

ranking of gwent players, (iv) calculate conversion rates and other elements
of gwent performance; (v) maintain technical support services for game users;

we can use your data to help us operate and improve gwent (assuming you play
it ofc – hey, it’s a great game you know :)!)

9.4 non-personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we might process some aggregated and general non-
personal data on user behaviour (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] sales per region, number of support
tickets) and share it with trusted partners who work with us to provide gog
services to you (for example, with games developers/publishers selling games
on gog.com or with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend
gog services or to help them to improve their products, which you have bought. [CLS] [SEP]
we may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help
us run gog.com. [CLS] [SEP] fear not, as mentioned above, everything’s anonymised, so you
cannot be identified. [CLS] [SEP]

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] data sharings

your use of gog services are accessible to other gog users. [CLS] [SEP] for example: other
users of gog services will be able to see your username and avatar (if you
choose to have one). [CLS] [SEP] we may also display other information derived from your
activity on gog services. [CLS] [SEP] we do this to help gog users to find gamers with
similar tastes and to build the gog user community. [CLS] [SEP] you can manage the privacy
settings of your gog user profile in your gog account. [CLS] [SEP]

can disable this function and manage the visibility of your profile through
your gwent account settings at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

via multiplayer games like gwent) may reveal your screen name, other details
about you and the content of any communications by you with other users (see
further section 10.2 above re gwent). [CLS] [SEP] also, any information and content you
share publicly using gog services (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] on our forums or your gog user
profile) will be accessible to gog users and others. [CLS] [SEP] consider carefully with
whom you share your information and avoid sharing contact or private
information about yourself. [CLS] [SEP]

information with others (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] in chat) but it's your responsibility. [CLS] [SEP]

our trusted partners

10.4. [CLS] [SEP] in general, we do not disclose information about you to third parties
without your consent. [CLS] [SEP] we may share your data only with the following
categories of third parties who were engaged by us to help deliver our

(particularly comments). [CLS] [SEP] use of the recaptcha service is subject to the google

10.7 your information may be processed, stored and transferred outside your
country of residence and beyond the european economic area (eea) and
switzerland, such as the united states, canada or brazil. [CLS] [SEP] privacy laws in
these countries may not offer the same level of protection as in your country
or in the eea. [CLS] [SEP] but whenever we’re sharing your personal information outside
the eea and switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the eu standard
contractual clauses and/or other lawful measures to transfer your data and
establish adequate protection of your personal information

### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] third party information collection and external services

11.1 gog services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the
websites or services of third parties (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] to games developers whose games
are on gog). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, third parties (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] games developers/publishers) may
also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] your email address or
name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any
such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. [CLS] [SEP]
this may include saving information to your gog profile in relation to their
games (such as, for example, saving game progress). [CLS] [SEP] our privacy policy does
not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to
their privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] this also applies to gog galaxy integrations created
by the community. [CLS] [SEP]

you may find links on gog.com that lead outside our website. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes we
might need to direct you elsewhere (like a developer’s website) if you want to
access additional features built into your games. [CLS] [SEP] these sites might collect
your information under their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

11.2 gog services may also offer you easy and optional access to gog-approved
trusted partners’ services, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] the websites and games provided by our
related company cd projekt. [CLS] [SEP] in order to do this, we will need to share some of
your personal information (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] your email address) with them, as long as you
agree to it. [CLS] [SEP] this personal information will be protected under our trusted
partner’s privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

you can use gog services to access cool stuff from gog-approved trusted
partners. [CLS] [SEP] we will need to share some personal information with them (which you
control). [CLS] [SEP] it is up to you if you want to use your gog account for this or not. [CLS] [SEP]

11.3 a quick word about gog connect (which you can read more about here). [CLS] [SEP] in
order for us to provide this (optional) feature to you, we will need access to
valve’s service allowing us to retrieve certain data regarding steam and games
available via steam (“steam data”). [CLS] [SEP] we will treat the steam data consistent
with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] we will only retrieve steam data regarding your
steam account as requested by you and we will notify you what if any steam
data is stored by us. [CLS] [SEP] we will not intercept, store or use your steam password
or login. [CLS] [SEP] in accordance with valve’s requirements, steam data is provided: (i)
"as is," "with all faults" and "as available," and the entire risk as to
satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with you. [CLS] [SEP] to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, valve, steam game publishers and
developers, and their suppliers make no representations, warranties or
conditions, express or implied. [CLS] [SEP] valve, steam game publishers and developers,
and their suppliers expressly disclaim any and all warranties or conditions,
express, statutory and implied, including without limitation (a) warranties or
conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike
effort, accuracy, title, quiet enjoyment, no encumbrances, no liens and non-
infringement, (b) warranties or conditions arising through course of dealing
or usage of trade, and (c) warranties or conditions of uninterrupted or error-
free access or use. [CLS] [SEP] (ii) in no event will valve or any supplier be liable for
any damages, including without limitation any indirect, consequential,
special, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of, based on, or
resulting from its api terms of use or your use of steam web api, steam data,
or valve brand & links, even if such party has been advised of the possibility
of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusion of damages under this paragraph is independent
of your exclusive remedy and survives in the event such remedy fails of its
essential purpose or is otherwise deemed unenforceable. [CLS] [SEP] these limitations and
exclusions apply without regard to whether the damages arise from (a) breach
of contract, (b) breach of warranty, (c) negligence, or (d) any other cause of
action, to the extent such exclusion and limitations are not prohibited by
applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree with any part of the above, or you have
any dispute or claim against valve or its suppliers with respect to the above,
then your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the steam web api,
steam data, and valve brand & links. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’d like to use our gog connect feature, we’ll require access to your
“steam data” (more info opposite). [CLS] [SEP] there are some legal rules that valve
requires us to follow. [CLS] [SEP]

accounts we may transfer personally identifiable information to an involved
third party who will protect this to at least the same level as we do in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

regardless of any reorganisations, acquisitions, etc., your personal
information will be protected the same way as it is right now. [CLS] [SEP] fear not!
