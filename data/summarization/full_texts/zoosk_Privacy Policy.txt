collect certain types of usage information when you visit or interact with our
email communications, websites and other online services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may
collect log data about your device and its software, such as your ipâ address,

third-party partners and providers may also collect personal information about
your online activities over time and across different websites when you use
our websites and online services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **what types of cookies does the company use?**

the types of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of
the following categories: strictly necessary, analytics, functionality,
advertising, social media and fraud prevention. [CLS] [SEP] in order to provide you with
the best browsing experience, the company and our third party partners may use
cookies from all of these categories. [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more about the cookies
we use from each of the categories in the table below. [CLS] [SEP]

 **strictly necessary cookies**|  these cookies are essential to make our
website work. [CLS] [SEP] they enable you to move around our site and use its features. [CLS] [SEP]
without these cookies, services that are necessary for you to be able to use
the site such as accessing secure areas canât be provided. [CLS] [SEP] these include
cookies used to authenticate users during log-in. [CLS] [SEP]  
---|---  
 **analytics cookies**|  these cookies collect information about how people
are using our website, for example which pages are visited the most often, how
people are moving from one link to another and if they get error messages from
certain pages. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies donât gather information that identifies you. [CLS] [SEP]
all information these cookies collect is grouped together with information
from other peopleâs use of the website on an anonymous basis. [CLS] [SEP] overall, these
cookies provide us with analytical information about how our website is
performing and how we can improve it. [CLS] [SEP]  
 **functionality cookies**|  these cookies allow us to remember choices you
make and tailor our website to provide enhanced features and content to you. [CLS] [SEP]

or on other devices you use. [CLS] [SEP]  
 **social media cookies**|  in order to enhance your internet experience and

 **third party data collection & interest-based advertising**

we participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising
companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. [CLS] [SEP]
we permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and
other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our
online services over time so that they may play or display ads on our
services, on other websites, or services you may use, and on other devices you
may use. [CLS] [SEP] typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based
advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web
beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar
technology (collectively, âtracking technologiesâ), which recognize the
device you are using and collect information, including click stream
information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, adid, precise
geolocation and other information. [CLS] [SEP] we may share a common account identifier
(such as a hashed email address or user id) with our third-party advertising
partners to help identify you across devices. [CLS] [SEP] we and our third-party partners
use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant
to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as
reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use
services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve
targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. [CLS] [SEP] we may do this by providing
a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform
provider. [CLS] [SEP] see â **your choices about online ads** â here, to learn more

features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies. [CLS] [SEP]

we display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as

companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct
advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those
users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share
similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. [CLS] [SEP] we may
share a unique identifier, such as a user id or hashed email address, with
these platform providers or they may collect information from our website
visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising
to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. [CLS] [SEP] these

companies that provide them. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want to receive targeted ads on
your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences
