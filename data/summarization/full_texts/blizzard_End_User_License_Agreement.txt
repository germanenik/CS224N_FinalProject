      6. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the platform to interact with blizzard and other players is governed by blizzard’s code of conduct (the “code of conduct”) and applicable in-game policies (the “in-game policies”).

      3. [CLS] [SEP] you may not transfer your rights and obligations to use the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] you agree to be solely responsible for any taxes, fees, charges, duties, withholdings, assessments, and the like, together with any interest, penalties, and additions imposed in connection with such transfer. [CLS] [SEP] other than as set forth above, blizzard does not recognize any purported transfer of the games. [CLS] [SEP]

      5. [CLS] [SEP] some of the games may be subject to specific license terms that may include the following:

        1. [CLS] [SEP] trial or “starter” versions of games allow you to play a limited version of the game before you will be required to purchase a game license from blizzard. [CLS] [SEP] licenses to use the full version of these games can be purchased through the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

        2. [CLS] [SEP] in certain cases, the “full version,” of games can only be played after you purchase and add a game license to your account. [CLS] [SEP]

      6. [CLS] [SEP] you may play the game(s) you have licensed at authorized publicly-available cyber cafés or computer gaming centers on the platform through an account registered to you. [CLS] [SEP]

      7. [CLS] [SEP] certain games may be obtained through the platform, but may not be playable on the platform. [CLS] [SEP] in such an event, the game will be provided with a separate end user license agreement that will govern your installation and use of the game post purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

      8. [CLS] [SEP] games which are produced by blizzard’s licensors and distributed through, and/or played upon, the platform will require that you agree to the licensor’s end user license agreement prior to your being able to play the game on the platform, and the terms and conditions of licensor’s end user license agreement are hereby incorporated into this agreement by this reference. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a conflict between the terms between this agreement and a licensor’s end user license agreement pertaining to the use of the licensor’s game, the licensor’s end user license agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the licensor’s game. [CLS] [SEP] however, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this agreement and the licensor’s end user license agreement pertaining to any other aspect of the platform, this agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] **license limitations.** blizzard may suspend or revoke your license to use the platform, or parts, components and/or single features thereof, if you violate, or assist others in violating, the license limitations set forth below.
