email is piped to our application by postfix. [CLS] [SEP]

our server uses postfix as the mail server software and nginx as the web
server. [CLS] [SEP] nginx access and error logs are kept which do record ip addresses. [CLS] [SEP]
default log settings are used for postfix. [CLS] [SEP] all log files are rotated daily and
retained for 7 days, old log files are deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

server logs are only used to improve our service and prevent abuse or
prohibited use. [CLS] [SEP] this information will not be provided under any circumstances
to any parties other than when compelled by law. [CLS] [SEP]

authentication code (mac) to detect any modifications to the encrypted string. [CLS] [SEP]
two factor authentication (2fa) is also available on our site and we encourage

opportunistic dane tls encryption with strong cipher preference is used for
all emails sent through our service. [CLS] [SEP] our mail server also utilises starttls,

protect emails sent to/from our server against mitm (man in the middle)
downgrade attacks and also against the risk of email forgery. [CLS] [SEP]

security), a strict csp (content security policy), subresource integrity,
expect ct and xss protection. [CLS] [SEP]
