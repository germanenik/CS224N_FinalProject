if you are an owner of an account on this website, you are solely responsible
for maintaining the confidentiality of your private user details (username and
password). [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all activities that occur under your
account or password. [CLS] [SEP] do not give out or share your private account information
to others. [CLS] [SEP] you may be held responsible for damages occurring from the misuse
or abuse of your account. [CLS] [SEP] you must notify diy tube video community immediately
of any improper use of/or breach in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve all rights to terminate accounts, edit or remove content and cancel
orders at our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]



**optional personal information**

the following information is optional and is not required to sign up for an
account. [CLS] [SEP] members may continue to use their account freely, as long as they
like, without entering the following personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the extended
personal information will be required in order to receive payments in the
future. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to receive payments, members will have to maintain current and valid
personal information including full name, address and email. [CLS] [SEP] this is in order
for diy tube video community to comply with all federal and local tax laws for
each country in which a member resides. [CLS] [SEP] as with any site which pays its
members, some personal information is required for payment purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

it is the member's responsibility to maintain up to date personal information
in their account. [CLS] [SEP] diy tube video community cannot be held responsible for lost
or missing payments due to incorrect personal information. [CLS] [SEP]



**rewards and payments**

after october 10, 2019, diy tube coin will be launched on our own blockchain. [CLS] [SEP]
diy tube coins are rewards for members of the diy tube video community
website. [CLS] [SEP] once diyt coin is openly trading on exchanges, it will have real
value and can be traded or sold or exchanged for fiat currency. [CLS] [SEP] for this
reason each member is responsible for maintaining their personal information
and protecting their passwords and usernames. [CLS] [SEP] diyt coins should be treated as
money due to their value on the coin exchanges and for use inside the
community. [CLS] [SEP]

members are paid for video views, comments and thumbs up on both their
comments and their videos. [CLS] [SEP] payments are made every 24 hours inside the diy
tube video community. [CLS] [SEP]

diy tube video community will take every precaution to protect its members
personal information and rewards. [CLS] [SEP] diy tube cannot be held liable for loss of
data or theft due to hacked accounts or weak passwords. [CLS] [SEP]

diy tube video community reserves the right to close any account found
violating these terms and conditions, including the freezing of assets or
returning any earned rewards to the community pool wallet. [CLS] [SEP] this will only
happen under extreme circumstances and after multiple fair warnings. [CLS] [SEP] frozen
accounts will be retained for a period of time in order to allow the member to
later return after a suspension. [CLS] [SEP] only after multiple warnings and suspensions
for violation of these terms will an account be fully closed and its funds
returned to the pool. [CLS] [SEP] this is an extreme situation and not the norm. [CLS] [SEP]

diy tube video community reserves the right to immediately terminate an
account without warning for the protection of the community as a whole, if
needed. [CLS] [SEP] this situation could occur, for example, when a member uploads
copyrighted materials and diy tube receives a copyright complaint from the
original content owner. [CLS] [SEP]

copy/paste spam, comment spam or manipulation of video views in order to
falsely increase earnings will result in immediate termination of a member's
account, thereby freezing all earnings in the virtual wallet. [CLS] [SEP] this includes,
but is not limited to, the use of bots or other programs or apps which are
used to falsely increase video views or generate comments. [CLS] [SEP] diy tube video
community software searches for patterns of abuse which are then confirmed by
a live administrator. [CLS] [SEP]

since early 2018 members have been receiving virtual diy tube coins inside diy
tube video community. [CLS] [SEP] virtual diy tube coins have been a sort of iou for the
launch of the official blockchain and diy tube coin. [CLS] [SEP] diy tube video community
cannot predict the future nor guaranty success and can therefore make no
promises on the future value of diyt coin and the blockchain. [CLS] [SEP] we can, at this
time, only offer hope that as we grow together, we can all share the wealth in
the future. [CLS] [SEP]

together we can grow the value of the diy tube video community and the value
of diy tube coins by uploading videos, commenting, interacting and spreading
the word. [CLS] [SEP] as the community grows, so will its value. [CLS] [SEP]

no guaranty of diyt coin value will be made at this time, nor can it be
guaranteed in the future. [CLS] [SEP] the success of the community depends on its overall
growth and future coin value. [CLS] [SEP] diyt coins are useful inside the community for
purchasing perks and upgrades, trading and tipping others for a good video. [CLS] [SEP]
other uses for internal virtual diyt and more perks are planned for the future
as well as an internal store where members will be able to purchase items with
their diyt coins. [CLS] [SEP]



**spam, plagiarism, harassment or abuse**

spam, plagiarism, or other copyright violations will not be tolerated. [CLS] [SEP] videos
portraying parodies of another member of the diy tube video community will be
removed without notice. [CLS] [SEP] harassment, trolling or other related behavior is not
acceptable and may get your account suspended. [CLS] [SEP] copy/paste comments will be
removed without notice by the diy tube team. [CLS] [SEP]



**freedom of speech**

diy tube video community supports the freedom of speech as long as that
freedom does not impinge on another member's freedom. [CLS] [SEP] members are free to
upload content or leave comments as long as they do not violate the terms and
conditions in this contract. [CLS] [SEP]

channel owners and video owners reserve the full right to modify, filter or
delete any comments or content on their own channel which they deem unfit or
in violation of their own freedom. [CLS] [SEP]

in the diy tube video community the freedom of speech does not imply the
ability to slander, harass or otherwise violate the freedom of another member
of the community. [CLS] [SEP]

simply stated: your freedom ends when it impinges on another member's freedom
or rights. [CLS] [SEP]

a channel is a member's personal space. [CLS] [SEP] consider this: if you came to my house
and spray painted vulgar obscenities about my family on my house - do i not
have the right to remove it?

diy tube is intended to be a family oriented community and all state and
federal laws apply. [CLS] [SEP]



**other**

violation of any of these terms may result in termination of your account. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to amend or modify these terms without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP]
although the diy tube video team will attempt to contact members about major
changes to these terms, there is no guaranty we can reach everyone due to a
full inbox, incorrect email addresses or other issues. [CLS] [SEP] it is the
responsibility of the individual to read these terms and check back from time
to time for updates. [CLS] [SEP]
