a home to explore, contribute to, and celebrate the world of pop culture. [CLS] [SEP] our
privacy policy (“ **privacy policy** ”) is designed to help you understand how
we collect, use and share your personal information and to assist you in
exercising the privacy rights available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

## scope

(corporate number c2935209), whose registered office is at 130 sutter street,
4th floor, san francisco, ca 94104 and we are the data controller of the
personal information that we collect from you as described in this privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy applies to personal information processed by us in our
business, including on our websites, mobile applications, and our related
online and offline offerings (collectively, the “ **services** ”). [CLS] [SEP] the
services include websites at fandom.com, wikia.com and wikia.org, and the
respective subdomains, and the mobile apps provided under the fandom brand. [CLS] [SEP]
the services also include the d&d beyond mobile app and the websites at
dndbeyond.com, futhead.com, gamepedia.com, muthead.com, playbook.gg, and
strawpoll.me. [CLS] [SEP]

we respect your right to privacy. [CLS] [SEP] our overall aim is to ensure that our
collection and use of personal information is appropriate to the provision of
the services for our users, and is in accordance with applicable data
protection laws. [CLS] [SEP]

## personal information we collect

the categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact
with our services, and the requirements of applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] **visitors** are
people who access the services. [CLS] [SEP] visitors include **registered users** who
access the services through their accounts and **non-registered users** who
access the services without using an account. [CLS] [SEP] we recognize that most visitors
are non-registered users. [CLS] [SEP]

you do not need to be a registered user in order to access most information on
the services. [CLS] [SEP] being a registered user is only required for certain activities,
such as creating, managing, or administrating a fandom community, making a
contribution to a fandom community that does not allow for contributions by
non-registered users, submitting comments about other content on the services,
or participating in a chat forum. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you must be a registered user
in order to view certain content on our mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP]

**information you provide to us**

**account creation**. [CLS] [SEP] when you create an account on the services in order to
become a registered user, we collect information such as your username and
password, valid email address, and date of birth. [CLS] [SEP] you may optionally provide
us with additional information including your first and last names, your
gender, and your interests and hobbies. [CLS] [SEP] certain websites and apps in the

postal mailing address, telephone number, and payment information. [CLS] [SEP] we refer to
the information provided at account creation as “ **registration data**.”

**visitors**. [CLS] [SEP] we collect the information you provide when modifying the
content of a page on the services (such as making edits, uploading images,
etc.). [CLS] [SEP] your username or another indicator that you provided the information is
left on the history tab associated with the edited page or appropriate
special/image page, on the recent changes link, and in your user
contributions. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information you provide when you upload,
purchase, view, or download certain content or products from the services. [CLS] [SEP]
further, the fandom mobile app asks you to indicate the communities in which
you are particularly interested. [CLS] [SEP] we refer to this information collected from
visitors as “ **visitor data**.”

**payment information**. [CLS] [SEP] you may purchase digital items or other goods using
the services. [CLS] [SEP] we use a third-party payment provider to process payments on the
services. [CLS] [SEP] we may receive information associated with your payment information,
such as billing address and transaction information, but we do not directly
store payment information on the services. [CLS] [SEP]

**your communications with us**. [CLS] [SEP] we collect personal information from you such
as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request
information about our services, register for our newsletters, request customer

participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include
personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

**interactive features**. [CLS] [SEP] we offer interactive features such as forums, blogs,
chat and messaging services, and social media pages. [CLS] [SEP] we and others who use our
services may collect the information you submit or make available through
these interactive features. [CLS] [SEP] any content you provide via the public sections of
these features will be considered “public” and is not subject to the privacy
protections referenced herein. [CLS] [SEP] by using these interactive features, you assume
the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used
by third parties for their own purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

**registration for sweepstakes or contests**. [CLS] [SEP] we may run sweepstakes and
contests. [CLS] [SEP] contact information you provide may be used to inform you about the
sweepstakes or contest and for other promotional, marketing and business
purposes, if permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP] in some jurisdictions, we are required to
publicly share information of winners. [CLS] [SEP]

**conferences, trade shows, and other events**. [CLS] [SEP] we may attend conferences,
trade shows, and other events where we collect personal information from
individuals who interact with or express an interest in the services. [CLS] [SEP] if you
provide us with any information at one of these events, we will use it for the
purposes for which it was collected. [CLS] [SEP]

**business development and strategic partnerships**. [CLS] [SEP] we may collect personal
information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential
business opportunities. [CLS] [SEP]

**job applications**. [CLS] [SEP] we may post job openings and opportunities on the

information contained therein to assess your suitability, aptitude, skills,
and qualifications for employment. [CLS] [SEP]

**information collected automatically**

**automatic data collection**. [CLS] [SEP] we may collect certain information
automatically when you use the services. [CLS] [SEP] this information may include your
internet protocol (ip) address, user settings, mac address, cookie
identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers,
details about your browser, operating system or device, location information
(including inferred location based off of your ip address), internet service
provider, pages that you visit before, during, and after using the services,
information about the links you click, information about how you interact with
the services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, the
search requests you submit on the services, and other information about how
you use the services. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect may be associated with accounts
and devices. [CLS] [SEP]

**cookies, pixel tags/web beacons, and analytics information**. [CLS] [SEP] we, as well as
third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the
services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies
(“technologies”) to automatically collect information through the services. [CLS] [SEP]
technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that
allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you
visit or interact with our services. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **cookies**. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you do that, the services may not work properly. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **pixel tags/web beacons**. [CLS] [SEP] a pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the services that collects information about engagement on the services. [CLS] [SEP] the use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. [CLS] [SEP] we may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **flash cookies**. [CLS] [SEP] we may, in certain situations, use adobe flash player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. [CLS] [SEP] to improve your user experience, local shared objects (commonly known as “flash cookies”) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. [CLS] [SEP] flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser. [CLS] [SEP] this means it is not possible to manage flash cookies at the browser level, in the same way you would manage cookies. [CLS] [SEP] instead, you can access your flash management tools from adobe’s website directly. [CLS] [SEP] the [adobe website](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable flash cookies. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that if you disable or reject flash cookies for the services, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in. [CLS] [SEP]

**analytics**. [CLS] [SEP] we may use google analytics, quantcast, comscore and other
service providers to collect and process analytics information on our
services. [CLS] [SEP] google analytics uses cookies to aid us in traffic analysis and
informing improvements to the services. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about google
analytics, please visit
[www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). [CLS] [SEP]
you can opt out of google’s collection and processing of data generated by
your use of the services by going to
<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. [CLS] [SEP] quantcast and comscore collect
information about the number of visitors to our services and extrapolate
market research from that data. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about quantcast, please
visit [www.quantcast.com/docs/privacy](http://www.quantcast.com/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] for
more information about comscore, please visit
<https://www.comscore.com/about/privacy-policy>. [CLS] [SEP]

**information from other sources**

we may obtain information about you from other sources, including through
third party services and organizations to supplement information provided by
you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you access our services through a third-party
application, such as an app store, a third-party login service, or a social
networking site, we may collect information about you from that third-party
application that you have made public via your privacy settings. [CLS] [SEP] information
we collect through these services may include your name, your user
identification number, your username, location, gender, birth date, email,
profile picture, and your contacts stored in that service. [CLS] [SEP] we use this
information to supplement the information we collect about you in order to
provide more relevant, safer experiences for you with the services and improve
the services, analytics, and advertising. [CLS] [SEP] if we combine or associate
information from other sources with information that we collect through the
services, we will treat the combined information in accordance with this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## additional provisions of this privacy policy that are applicable to eea and
uk residents

**what is our justification for handling your personal data?**

under european and uk data protection laws, we have to ensure that we process
your personal information fairly and lawfully. [CLS] [SEP] this means that we must have a
“legal basis” for each of our processing activities where they relate to the
personal data of an individual within the eea. [CLS] [SEP] these bases include:

  * **consent** – we may decide to obtain your specific, freely given consent to one or more processing activities;
  * **legal obligation** – we may need to process your data where it is necessary to comply with applicable laws that we are subject to;
  * **performance of a contract** – we may process your data if we are entering into a contract with you, or taking preparatory steps to do so;
  * **legitimate interests** – we may process your personal data where we believe that we have a legitimate interest in doing so, and we have analyzed this and determined that our interests are not overridden by the impact on your rights and freedoms under data protection law. [CLS] [SEP]

we rely on these legal bases in different ways, and in relation to different
types of processing of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

**consent**

we process your personal information collected through the use of advertising
or targeting related cookies (as described above) on the basis of your
consent, which we ask for when you first visit a website within the services. [CLS] [SEP]
you are entitled to withdraw your consent to our use of these cookies. [CLS] [SEP] the
list of partners for which we request consent is located at our [vendor
list](https://www.fandom.com/partner-list). [CLS] [SEP] in order to change your consent,
please utilize the “clear cookies” functionality in your browser (this will
prompt us to ask for your consent when you next visit a website within the
services). [CLS] [SEP]

**legitimate interests**

we believe that our use of your other personal information described herein is
necessary for our legitimate interests, which are as follows:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] to run, grow and develop our business;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] to operate the services;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] for marketing, market research and business development; and
  4. [CLS] [SEP] for internal administrative purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

if we rely on our, or another person’s, legitimate interests for using your
personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our
(or the other person’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection. [CLS] [SEP] you can
ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details
provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

we process your personal information collected through the use of
operationally necessary, performance related, and functionality related
cookies (as described above) on the basis of our legitimate interests. [CLS] [SEP] we also
rely on legitimate interests to use your personal information in order to
provide you with access to the services, and to make sure that they work

different parts of our services. [CLS] [SEP]
