# privacy policyâ¶

effective date: **september 30, 2019**

welcome to read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] at read the docs, we believe in protecting the
privacy of our users, authors, and readers. [CLS] [SEP]

## the short versionâ¶

we collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the
minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the
purpose of your interaction with us; we donât sell it to third parties; and
we only use it as this privacy policy describes. [CLS] [SEP]

of course, the short version doesnât tell you everything, so please read on
for more details!

## our servicesâ¶

read the docs is made up of:

readthedocs.org (âread the docs communityâ)

    

this is a website aimed at documentation authors and project maintainers
writing and distributing technical documentation. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy applies
to this site in full without reservation. [CLS] [SEP]

readthedocs.com (âread the docs for businessâ)

    

this website is a commercial hosted offering for hosting private documentation
for corporate clients. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy applies to this site in full
without reservation. [CLS] [SEP]

readthedocs.io, readthedocs-hosted.com, and other domains (âdocumentation
sitesâ)

    

these websites are where read the docs hosts documentation (â[user-generated
content](terms-of-service.html#user-generated-content)â) on behalf of
documentation authors. [CLS] [SEP] a best effort is made to apply this privacy policy to
these sites but the documentation may contain content and files created by
documentation authors. [CLS] [SEP]

all use of read the docs is subject to this privacy policy, together with our
[terms of service](terms-of-service.html). [CLS] [SEP]

## what information read the docs collects and whyâ¶

### information from website browsersâ¶

if youâre **just browsing the website** , we collect the same basic
information that most websites collect. [CLS] [SEP] we use common internet technologies,
such as cookies and web server logs. [CLS] [SEP] we collect this basic information from
everybody, whether they have an account or not. [CLS] [SEP]

the information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:

  * the visitorâs browser type

  * language preference

  * referring site

  * the date and time of each visitor request

we also collect potentially personally-identifying information like internet
protocol (ip) addresses. [CLS] [SEP]

#### why do we collect this?â¶

we collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use
read the docs, and to monitor and protect the security of the website. [CLS] [SEP]

### information from users with accountsâ¶

if you **create an account** , we require some basic information at the time
of account creation. [CLS] [SEP] you will create your own user name and password, and we
will ask you for a valid email account. [CLS] [SEP] you also have the option to give us
more information if you want to, and this may include âuser personal
information.â

âuser personal informationâ is any information about one of our users
which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him
or her. [CLS] [SEP] information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real
name, and a photograph are examples of âuser personal information.â

user personal information does not include aggregated, non-personally
identifying information. [CLS] [SEP] we may use aggregated, non-personally identifying
information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service. [CLS] [SEP]

#### why do we collect this information?â¶

  * we need your user personal information to create your account, and to provide the services you request. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we use your user personal information, specifically your user name, to identify you on read the docs. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we will use your email address to communicate with you but it is not shared publicly. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we limit our use of your user personal information to the purposes listed in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] if we need to use your user personal information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. [CLS] [SEP] you can always see what information we have in your [user account](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/edit/). [CLS] [SEP]

## what information read the docs does not collectâ¶

we do not intentionally collect **sensitive personal information** , such as
social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious
information. [CLS] [SEP]

documentation sites hosted on read the docs are public, anyone (including us)
may view their contents. [CLS] [SEP] if you have included private or sensitive information
in your documentation site, such as email addresses, that information may be
indexed by search engines or used by third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

read the docs for business may host [private projects](terms-of-
service.html#private-projects) which we treat as confidential and we only
access them for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for
security reasons

if youâre a **child under the age of 13** , you may not have an account on
read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] read the docs does not knowingly collect information from or
direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn or
have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will
unfortunately have to close your account. [CLS] [SEP] we donât want to discourage you
from writing software documentation, but those are the rules. [CLS] [SEP]

## how we share the information we collectâ¶

we **do not** share, sell, rent, or trade user personal information with third
parties for their commercial purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not disclose user personal information outside read the docs, except in
the situations listed in this section or in the section below on compelled
disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]

we **do** share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information
with others about how our users, collectively, use read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
we may compile statistics on the prevalence of different types of
documentation across read the docs for a blog post or popularity of
programming languages for advertising partners. [CLS] [SEP]

we **do** host advertising on documentation sites. [CLS] [SEP] this advertising is first-
party advertising hosted by read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] we **do not** run any code from
advertisers and all ad images are hosted on read the docsâ servers. [CLS] [SEP] for more
details, see our document on [advertising details](advertising/advertising-
details.html). [CLS] [SEP]

we may use user personal information with your permission, so we can perform
services you have requested. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you request service on
commercially hosted docs, we will ask your permission to sync your private
repositories. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share user personal information with a limited number of third party
vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and
who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]
for more details, see our next section on third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

### third party vendorsâ¶

as we mentioned, we may share some information with third party vendors or it
may be collected by them on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] the information collected and stored
by third parties is subject to their policies and practices. [CLS] [SEP] this list will be
updated from time to time and we encourage you to check back periodically. [CLS] [SEP]

#### payment processingâ¶

should you choose to become a
[supporter](https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/), purchase a [gold
membership](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/gold/), or become a subscriber to
read the docsâ commercial hosting product, your payment information and
details will be processed by stripe. [CLS] [SEP] read the docs does not store your payment
information. [CLS] [SEP]

#### site monitoringâ¶

read the docs uses sentry and new relic to diagnose errors and improve the
performance of our site. [CLS] [SEP] both companies take part in the eu-us privacy shield
framework. [CLS] [SEP] we aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but
the information may include your ip address. [CLS] [SEP]

#### analyticsâ¶

we go into detail on analytics in a separate section specific to analytics. [CLS] [SEP]

#### support deskâ¶

read the docs uses intercom to manage support requests for documentation
hosted through read the docs for business. [CLS] [SEP] if you request support â
typically via email â intercom may process your contact information. [CLS] [SEP]

#### email newsletterâ¶

if you sign up for the [read the docs email
newsletter](http://readthedocs.us3.list-
manage.com/subscribe?u=a6a22369cc2b356379cf789ca&id=a85a83a5a5), your email
address and name will be stored by mailchimp. [CLS] [SEP] this newsletter is separate from
creating a read the docs account and signing up for read the docs does not opt
you in for the newsletter. [CLS] [SEP]

you can manage your email subscription including unsubscribing and deleting
your records with mailchimp. [CLS] [SEP] there is a link to do so in the footer of any
newsletter you receive from us. [CLS] [SEP]

### public information on read the docsâ¶

most of read the docs is public-facing including user names, project names,
and documentation sites. [CLS] [SEP] if your content is public-facing, third parties may
access it. [CLS] [SEP] we do not sell that content; it is yours. [CLS] [SEP]

## our use of cookies and trackingâ¶

### do not trackâ¶

read the docs supports do not track (dnt) and respects usersâ tracking
preferences. [CLS] [SEP] specifically, we support the [w3câs tracking preference
expression](https://www.w3.org/tr/tracking-dnt/) and the [effâs dnt
policy](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track). [CLS] [SEP]

for read the docs, this means:

  * we **do not** do behavioral ad targeting regardless of your dnt preference. [CLS] [SEP]

  * when dnt is enabled, both logged-in and logged-out users are considered opted-out of analytics. [CLS] [SEP]

  * regardless of dnt preference, our logs that contain ip addresses and user agent strings are deleted after 10 days unless a dnt exception applies. [CLS] [SEP]

  * our full dnt policy is [available here](https://readthedocs.org/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt). [CLS] [SEP]

our dnt policy applies without reservation to read the docs community and read
the docs for business. [CLS] [SEP] a best effort is made to apply this to documentation
sites, but we do not have complete control over the contents of these sites. [CLS] [SEP]

for more details about dnt, visit [all about do not
track](https://www.allaboutdnt.com). [CLS] [SEP]

important

due to the nature of our environment where documentation is built as
necessary, the dnt analytics opt-out for documentation sites only applies for
those sites generated after may 1, 2018. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookiesâ¶

read the docs uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and
meaningful. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences,
and provide information for future development of read the docs. [CLS] [SEP]

a cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer
or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. [CLS] [SEP]
cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting read the
docs; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. [CLS] [SEP]
the cookies read the docs sets are essential for the operation of the website,
or are used for performance or functionality. [CLS] [SEP] by using our website, you agree
that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. [CLS] [SEP] if you
disable your browser or deviceâs ability to accept cookies, you will not be
able to log in to read the docs. [CLS] [SEP]

### google analyticsâ¶

we use google analytics as a third party tracking service, but we donât use
it to track you individually or collect your user personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we use
google analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how
our users, in general, navigate through and use read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] this helps us
evaluate our usersâ use of read the docs; compile statistical reports on
activity; and improve our content and website performance. [CLS] [SEP]

google analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying
information over time, such as your ip address, browser type, internet service
provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your
use of read the docs. [CLS] [SEP] we do not link this information to any of your personal
information such as your user name. [CLS] [SEP]

read the docs will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the google
analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any user personal
information other than ip address; or correlate your ip address with your
identity. [CLS] [SEP] google provides further information about its own privacy practices
and offers a [browser add-on to opt out of google analytics
tracking](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). [CLS] [SEP] you may also opt-out of
analytics on read the docs by enabling do not track. [CLS] [SEP]

## how read the docs secures your informationâ¶

read the docs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect user personal
information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain
data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of user personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it. [CLS] [SEP]

no method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. [CLS] [SEP]
therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. [CLS] [SEP]

## read the docsâ global privacy practicesâ¶

**information that we collect will be stored and processed in the united
states** in accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] however, we understand that
we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy
expectations, and we try to meet those needs. [CLS] [SEP]

we provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the
world, regardless of their country of origin or location, additionally, we
require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to user personal
information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable
data privacy laws. [CLS] [SEP]

in particular:

  * read the docs provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

## resolving complaintsâ¶

if you have concerns about the way read the docs is handling your user
personal information, please let us know immediately by emailing us at
[privacy@readthedocs.org](mailto:privacy%40readthedocs.org). [CLS] [SEP]

## how we respond to compelled disclosureâ¶

read the docs may disclose personally-identifying information or other
information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid
subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we
believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our
property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. [CLS] [SEP]

in complying with court orders and similar legal processes, read the docs
strives for transparency. [CLS] [SEP] when permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to
notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited
by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

## how you can access and control the information we collectâ¶

if youâre already a read the docs user, you may access, update, alter, or
delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user
account](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/edit/). [CLS] [SEP]

### data retention and deletionâ¶

read the docs will retain user personal information for as long as your
account is active or as needed to provide you services. [CLS] [SEP]

we may retain certain user personal information indefinitely, unless you
delete it or request its deletion. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we donât automatically
delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we
will retain your account information indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP]

if you would like to delete your user personal information, you may do so in
your [user account](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/delete/). [CLS] [SEP] we will retain
and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements,
we will delete your full profile. [CLS] [SEP]

our web server logs for read the docs community, read the docs for business,
and documentation sites are deleted after 10 days barring legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

## changes to our privacy policyâ¶

we reserve the right to revise this privacy policy at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if we change
this privacy policy in the future, we will post the revised privacy policy and
update the âeffective date,â above, to reflect the date of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]

## contacting read the docsâ¶

questions regarding read the docsâ privacy policy or information practices
should be directed to
[privacy@readthedocs.org](mailto:privacy%40readthedocs.org). [CLS] [SEP]
