# riot games® terms of service

_last modified: january 15, 2020_

greetings players,

these terms of service (the “ **terms** ”) set out the terms and conditions by
which riot games offers you access to use and enjoy our games, apps, websites
and other services (the “ **riot services** ”). [CLS] [SEP] riot games is a global gaming
company headquartered in los angeles with offices and operations around the
world. [CLS] [SEP] when we say “ **riot games** ,” we’re referring to the riot games
entity responsible for providing the riot services in your region (see section
19, below) and these terms are an agreement between you and that entity. [CLS] [SEP]

please read these terms carefully and pay particular attention to these items:

  * **_dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP] if you reside in the united states, please read the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver inpart a of section 17. [CLS] [SEP] it affects how disputes between us are resolved._**
  

  * **_virtual content_**. [CLS] [SEP] when you click to purchase, earn or are gifted virtual content, you only get a license to access virtual content. [CLS] [SEP] you have no ownership in any of the virtual content you unlock and you can’t transfer it to someone else. [CLS] [SEP] virtual content has no monetary value, is generally game specific and you can’t redeem virtual content for any type of “real world” money. [CLS] [SEP] 
  

  * **_refund policy_**. [CLS] [SEP] you lose the right to change your mind, cancel the order and get a refund if you get immediate access to or download your digital content. [CLS] [SEP] there are some exceptions to this rule, but we have a strict policy on refunds. [CLS] [SEP] read about it [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-content-refund-faq). [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * **_user rules_**. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to follow our user rules (section 7). [CLS] [SEP] these rules govern both in-game behavior and certain out-of-game conduct while using the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] your account

#### 1.1. [CLS] [SEP] _am i eligible to create an account and use the riot services?_
**(you either must be an adult or have permission from your parents or legal
guardian.)**

to create an account and use the riot services, you must: (i) be an adult;
(ii) be an emancipated minor; or (iii) have valid parent or legal guardian
consent to be bound by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you’re not an adult or emancipated
minor, or don’t understand this section, please talk to your parents or legal
guardian and ask for help. [CLS] [SEP] if you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor
who creates an account with us, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound
by these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you are also responsible for all use of the account and
compliance with these terms by the minor, including all purchases made on the
account. [CLS] [SEP] you may not create or use an account or use any of the riot services
on behalf of any other person or other legal entity or for a commercial
purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1.2. [CLS] [SEP] _do i need to provide my real name and stuff?_ **(yes. [CLS] [SEP] please don’t
try to pull any kind of “definitely not blitzcrank” or “definitely not udyr”
funny business.)**

you must always supply us with accurate and complete info including your real
name. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1.3. [CLS] [SEP] _i have a ton of different email accounts. [CLS] [SEP] does it matter which one
i use to register my account?_ **(yes. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, you might miss important
notices!)**

we send account, legal and service related notices to the email address
registered to your account. [CLS] [SEP] these notifications may be really important (e.g.,
a notification that we intend to terminate your account for inactivity) so you
must keep the email address associated with your account current and (if we
ask) verified. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 1.4. [CLS] [SEP] _can i share or sell my account or login credentials?_ **(no.)**

when you create an account with us, we require you to select a unique username
and password (collectively, your “ **login credentials** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you agree that:

  * you can’t share your account or login credentials with anyone. [CLS] [SEP] 
  

  * you can’t sell, transfer or allow any other person to access your account or login credentials, or offer to do so. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  * you must keep your login credentials secret. [CLS] [SEP] 
  

you must notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security,
including any unauthorized account access or any loss, theft or unauthorized
use or disclosure of your login credentials or payment info so we can take
appropriate steps. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for all losses (including loss or use
of virtual content) on your account where you have shared your login
credentials or have failed to keep your account or login credentials secure. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] account termination

#### 2.1. [CLS] [SEP] _how can my account be suspended or terminated?_ **(if you break the
rules, demacian justice will be visited upon your account!)**

2.1.1. [CLS] [SEP] **_you._** you may terminate or suspend your account at any time by
contacting us at [support@riotgames.com](mailto: support@riotgames.com) . [CLS] [SEP]

2.1.2. [CLS] [SEP] **_us._** we may terminate or suspend your account without notice to
you if we reasonably determine, that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] you have breached any part of these terms (including the user rules);
  

  2. [CLS] [SEP] doing so would be in the best interests of our community or the riot services or is required for upholding a third party’s rights;
  

  3. [CLS] [SEP] we have stopped offering the riot services in your region (though we’ll normally post advance notice on our website, app or game if we plan to stop offering a material core feature of a game or all of the riot services in your region);
  

  4. [CLS] [SEP] you have failed to pay any fees you owe us (except in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct) or we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your account; or
  

  5. [CLS] [SEP] you have (or we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you have) made unauthorized use of someone else’s payment info. [CLS] [SEP]

we can make such determinations, with the assistance of automated systems and
machine learning tools or by using other methods that we think are
appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] if you think that we have made a mistake, please contact us with
details and we will review your case, though we may suspend your account
during our review. [CLS] [SEP] you can also challenge our determinations (see section 17). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2.2. [CLS] [SEP] _will riot maintain my account forever, even if i stop using it?_
**(if you abandon your account for a very long period of time, we may
terminate it after giving you notice and an opportunity to re-activate it.)**

if you do not use your account for a prolonged period of time, we reserve the
right to take measures against your account, including suspension or
termination. [CLS] [SEP] if we plan to take measures against your account based on
prolonged period of inactivity, we will let you know first (e.g., by email to
the email address registered to your account) and give you ample opportunity
to avoid such measures (e.g., deletion of your account). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 2.3. [CLS] [SEP] _what happens if riot terminates my account?_ **(no games for you
and you will lose access to any purchases including game currency and virtual
goods.)**

if your account is terminated, you’ll no longer have access to your account,
including any of the associated data or virtual content (including game
currency) (though this does not limit or affect any rights you have under data
or consumer protection laws). [CLS] [SEP] where we terminate for a legitimate reason (e.g. [CLS] [SEP]
where you have breached these terms):

  * you’ll not be entitled to any refunds and we’ll have no liability to you; and
  

  * we also reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created, as well as your access to any other riot services (also without any refunds or liability to you). [CLS] [SEP]
  

you understand and agree that using the riot services comes with the risk that
your account may be terminated or suspended in accordance with these terms and
that, whenever you use the riot services, you’ll bear this risk in mind and
always conduct yourself appropriately. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] limited license

#### 3.1. [CLS] [SEP] _what can i do with the riot services?_ **(you can enjoy the riot
services for your own, personal, non-commercial use.)**

we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to
use and enjoy the riot services (and any virtual content) for your individual,
non-commercial, entertainment purposes only and expressly conditioned upon
your compliance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if we terminate your account, any license
granted by us to you in the riot services and any virtual content ends
immediately. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise expressly authorized by us in a signed written
contract, you may not sell, copy, exchange, loan, reverse engineer, decompile,
derive source code from, translate, lease, grant a security interest in,
transfer, publish, assign or otherwise distribute any of the riot services or
any of riot games’ intellectual property, including any of our computer code
or virtual content. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 3.2. [CLS] [SEP] _can i do stuff with riot’s intellectual property?_ **(we reserve
all the rights to our ip, but do allow for some personal, non-commercial uses,
like fan art.)**

we (and our licensors) own and reserve all rights, title and interest in and
to the riot services, and all data and content posted, generated, provided or
otherwise made available in or through the riot services, including, user
accounts, computer code, titles, objects, artifacts, characters, character
names, chat logs, game recordings and broadcasts, locations, location names,
stories, dialog, catch phrases, artwork, graphics, structural or landscape
designs, animations, sounds, musical compositions and recordings, virtual
goods, in-game currency, audio-visual effects, character likenesses, methods
of operation and gameplay (collectively, “ **game content** ”). [CLS] [SEP] for clarity,
game content includes virtual content. [CLS] [SEP] you can’t create any work of authorship
based on the game content or riot services except as expressly permitted by
us. [CLS] [SEP] for more info about what fan uses we currently permit, please read our
[legal jibber jabber](http://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber) policy
(though be aware that we change this from time to time). [CLS] [SEP]

you also agree that unless we grant you a license, in a written contract
signed by us, you may never use any of our trademarks, service marks, trade
names, logos, domain names, taglines, or trade dress. [CLS] [SEP] any reproduction,
redistribution, or modification of the riot services, or use of the riot
services not in accordance with these terms, is expressly prohibited and may
result in severe civil and/or criminal penalties. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] virtual goods, game currency and purchases

#### 4.1. [CLS] [SEP] _what is virtual content?_ **(virtual content includes stuff like
game currency and virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes,
accessories, etc.)**

when using the riot services, we may provide you with opportunities to acquire
a limited license to access virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes,
etc., (“ **virtual goods** ”) and in-game currency (“ **game currency** ”),
associated with your account (collectively, “ **virtual content** ”). [CLS] [SEP]

game currency may only be used for the specific game for which it was
purchased unless we say otherwise at the time of purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4.2. [CLS] [SEP] _how do i get a “license” to access virtual content?_ **(buy it,
earn it, or receive it.)**

we may provide you with various opportunities to acquire a limited license to
access game currency or virtual content, including:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] purchasing it (e.g., with a credit card); 
  

  2. [CLS] [SEP] earning it (e.g., by accomplishing game missions or tasks); or
  

  3. [CLS] [SEP] receiving it (e.g., from another player as a gift or using crafting functionality like hextech®). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4.3. [CLS] [SEP] _do i “own” the virtual content i unlock?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] what you “unlock”
is not the virtual good itself, but rather, a non-transferable limited license
to access it.)**

you have no ownership or other property interest in any of the virtual content
you unlock, regardless of how you acquired access to it. [CLS] [SEP] virtual content has
no monetary value. [CLS] [SEP] you can’t transfer (unless we allow it in the functionality
of the riot services) or redeem virtual content for any type of “real world”
money. [CLS] [SEP] you can’t obtain any refunds for purchasing a license to access virtual
content, except as expressly permitted by us. [CLS] [SEP] you can find our current content
refund policy [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-
us/articles/201751864-content-refund-faq). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 4.4. [CLS] [SEP] _once again: i don’t _own_ my virtual content?_ **(“no!” shouted all
the lawyers.)**

when you obtain virtual content from us, what we are actually giving you is a
personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable,
limited right and license to use that virtual content only in connection with
your use of the applicable riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

**_notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these terms, you acknowledge
and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in your
account, and that all rights in and to your account are and shall forever be
owned by and inure to the benefit of riot games. [CLS] [SEP] you further acknowledge and
agree that you have no title, ownership, or other proprietary interest in any
virtual content, regardless of any consideration offered or paid in exchange. [CLS] [SEP]
furthermore, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence, or to
the extent these terms say otherwise, riot games shall not be liable in any
manner for the destruction, deletion, modification, impairment, hacking, or
any other damage or loss of any kind caused to virtual content, including the
deletion of virtual content upon the termination or expiration of your account
or our reasonable changes to the riot services._**

#### 4.5. [CLS] [SEP] _will my virtual content always be available?_ **(not necessarily,
no.)**

in an effort to constantly improve the riot services, evolve our games and
keep the riot services, safe, fun, and secure, we have the right to delete,
alter, move, remove, re-package, re-price, or transfer any and all game
content, including virtual content, in whole or in part, at any time, with or
without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
your virtual goods may (and likely will) evolve over time to improve the riot
services or for regulatory or legal reasons. [CLS] [SEP] if we decide to entirely retire
certain virtual goods that you recently purchased, we will provide you with a
replacement. [CLS] [SEP] we won’t delete your game currency without notice (such as
through posts on our website, app or game), unless your account is terminated
by us for a legitimate reason or by you under section 2.1.1. [CLS] [SEP] we may sometimes
change the purchasing power of game currency (for example, we might increase
the number of game currency needed to purchase virtual goods, such as skins). [CLS] [SEP]
we normally only do this in incremental steps but we’ll give you notice (such
as through posts on our website, app or game) if we plan to make changes that
will significantly impact your game currency in a negative way. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t
provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaim, any value, cash or otherwise,
attributed to any data residing on servers we operate or control, including
any game content or virtual content attributed to your account. [CLS] [SEP] if we allow
the sale or transfer of your right to access certain game content or virtual
content, it may only be conducted via services approved or provided by us, if
any. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] fees & taxes

#### 5.1. [CLS] [SEP] _is everything about the riot services free?_ **(no.)**

some aspects of the riot services may require you to pay a fee, and you agree
that you’ll provide accurate and complete payment info to us or the third-
party payment provider used by us. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree to pay all fees and
applicable taxes incurred on your account. [CLS] [SEP] we may revise the pricing for any
part of the riot services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] this can impact on the purchasing power
of your game currency, though we normally only do this in incremental steps. [CLS] [SEP]
all fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at
the time the fee or the charge becomes due and payable. [CLS] [SEP] we may, from time to
time, modify, amend, or supplement our fees and fee-billing methods, and such
changes shall be effective immediately upon posting in these terms or
elsewhere on our websites, apps or in our games. [CLS] [SEP] except in cases of our gross
negligence or willful misconduct, if you fail to pay any fees you owe to us or
we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your
account, we may suspend or terminate your account. [CLS] [SEP] see section 2 (account
termination) for more info. [CLS] [SEP]

**_subject to applicable law, any applicable fees and other charges for fee-
based services (including game currency) are payable in advance and aren’t
refundable in whole or in part except as expressly provided in these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
except in cases of riot’s gross negligence, or willful misconduct or to the
extent these terms say otherwise, you’re fully liable for all charges to your
account, including any unauthorized charges._**

#### 5.2. [CLS] [SEP] _what are my responsibilities relating to game currency?_ **(pay
applicable taxes; verify that all transactions with us are correct, etc.)**

you’re solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to
acquiring, using, or accessing game currency. [CLS] [SEP] game currency may be sold or
issued by us in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you
purchase and where you’re purchasing. [CLS] [SEP] as we feel it necessary, in our
reasonable discretion (or as prescribed by law), we may limit the total amount
of game currency that may be purchased for any one game or that may be held in
your account in the aggregate. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, price and availability of game
currency and virtual goods are subject to change. [CLS] [SEP] we may restrict how much
game currency you can purchase and/or use based on your location as we have
different approaches in different locations. [CLS] [SEP]

you should verify that the proper amount of game currency has been added to or
deducted from your account during any given transaction. [CLS] [SEP] please notify us
immediately if you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your
game currency balance. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll investigate your claim, and in doing so, may
request some additional info to verify it. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] unsolicited idea submission policy

#### 6.1. [CLS] [SEP] _can i submit ideas for improving the game to riot?_ **(please
don’t. [CLS] [SEP] if you do anyways, we’ll have the absolute right to use it forever.)**

we value your feedback on the riot services, but please don’t submit any
creative ideas, suggestions or materials to us (collectively, “ **unsolicited
ideas** ”). [CLS] [SEP] we may freely use any unsolicited ideas you provide. [CLS] [SEP] this policy
is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when the riot
services might seem similar to unsolicited ideas that people submit. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not have any legal rights in the unsolicited ideas you insist on
sending to us, but if you do, we will be allowed to use all or some of your
unsolicited ideas for any reason we choose and without any payment to you. [CLS] [SEP]

in legal terms, this means that if you submit unsolicited ideas to us, then
you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable,
transferable, assignable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free right and license to
use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works
based upon, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have
made, sell, offer for sale, and import your unsolicited ideas, including all
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, designs, industrial rights,
and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related to them, in any
media now known or in the future developed, for any purpose whatsoever,
commercial or otherwise, including giving the unsolicited ideas to others,
without any compensation to you. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent necessary, you agree that you
undertake to execute and deliver any and all documents and perform any and all
actions necessary or desirable to ensure that the rights to use the
unsolicited ideas granted to us as specified above are valid, effective, and
enforceable and you waive and agree never to assert those rights to the
maximum extent permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] user rules

#### 7.1. [CLS] [SEP] _can i troll, flame, threaten or harass people while using the riot
services?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] if you do, we might take action such as banning your
account.)**

while using the riot services, you must comply with all laws, rules and
regulations in the jurisdiction in which you reside. [CLS] [SEP] you must also comply with
the acceptable use and behavioral policies that we publish from time to time
on our websites, apps and games and the behavioral rules listed below
(collectively the “ **user rules** ”). [CLS] [SEP] the user rules posted to our websites,
apps and games or set out in this section are not meant to be exhaustive, and
we reserve the right to modify them, as well as take appropriate disciplinary
measures including temporary bans, account suspension or termination and
deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the riot services, regardless
of whether a specific behavior is listed in the user rules as inappropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

the following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] impersonating any person, business or entity, including an employee of riot games, or communicating in any way that makes it appear that the communication originates from riot games;
  

  2. [CLS] [SEP] publicly posting identifying info about yourself, riot games employees, or other players;
  

  3. [CLS] [SEP] harassing, stalking or threatening other players or riot games employees;
  

  4. [CLS] [SEP] removing, altering or concealing any copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary rights notice of riot games contained within the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] you also may not transmit content that violates or infringes the rights of others, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, publicity, personal rights or other rights;
  

  5. [CLS] [SEP] transmitting or communicating any content which we reasonably believe to be offensive to players, including language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethically, or otherwise objectionable;
  

  6. [CLS] [SEP] transmitting or facilitating the transmission of any content that contains a virus, corrupted data, trojan horse, bot keystroke logger, worm, time bomb, cancelbot or other computer programming routines that are intended to and/or actually damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or mine, scrape or expropriate any system, data or personal info;
  

  7. [CLS] [SEP] avoiding, bypassing, removing, deactivating, impairing, descrambling or otherwise circumventing any technological measure implemented by riot or any third party to protect the riot services;
  

  8. [CLS] [SEP] spamming chat, whether for personal or commercial purposes, by disrupting the flow of conversation with repeated postings;
  

  9. [CLS] [SEP] participating in any action which we reasonably believe does or may defraud any other player, including by scamming or social engineering;
  

  10. [CLS] [SEP] using any unauthorized third party programs, including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers and automation programs that interact with the riot services in any way, for any purpose, including any unauthorized third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication relating to the riot services and any unauthorized third party programs that collect info about the riot services by reading areas of memory used by the riot services to store info;
  

  11. [CLS] [SEP] accessing or attempting to access areas of the riot services that are not made available to the public;
  

  12. [CLS] [SEP] selecting an account or user name that is falsely indicative of an association with riot games, contains personally identifying info, or that is offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent this restriction on name choices, like user names. [CLS] [SEP] riot games may modify any name which riot games reasonably believes violates this provision, without notification to you, and may take further disciplinary measures, including account termination for repeated violations;
  

  13. [CLS] [SEP] non-participation, logging out or exiting a game during live game-play. [CLS] [SEP] riot games may track this data over time and issue a temporary ban when a player is determined to have left mid-game too many times. [CLS] [SEP] the length of the temporary ban will increase over time if a particular account continues to leave live game play; 
  

  14. [CLS] [SEP] playing on another person’s account or otherwise engaging in activity intended to “boost” an account’s status or rank;
  

  15. [CLS] [SEP] inducing or encouraging others to breach the user rules or these terms; or
  

  16. [CLS] [SEP] using the riot services for any business purpose without our express written consent or after we’ve asked you to stop using the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] user generated content

#### 8.1. [CLS] [SEP] _am i responsible for the content that i post on/in the riot
services?_ **(yes, and we can use what you post.)**

apart from unsolicited ideas (which we address separately, in section 6,
above), you’re also responsible for any other communications, user names,
images, sounds, or other material and info that you create, upload, use or
transmit with or through the riot services (“ **your content** ”). [CLS] [SEP]

you should upload or transmit your content only if you agree that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] you grant us, from the time of uploading or transmission of your content, a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, non-exclusive and royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works based upon, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, and import your content, including, all copyrights, publicity rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, industrial rights and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related to them, for the purpose of providing the riot services without any compensation to you; 
  

  2. [CLS] [SEP] you waive any moral rights you may have in your content with respect to our use of your content to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] if local laws do not allow for waiver of moral rights, instead you grant riot games the right to use your content and all elements of your content with or without your name or pseudonym, as well as to freely edit your content. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  3. [CLS] [SEP] you represent, warrant and agree that none of your content will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on the part of riot games and riot games won’t be liable for any use or disclosure of your content. [CLS] [SEP] 
  

  4. [CLS] [SEP] you further represent, warrant and agree that your content shall not violate any third-party rights. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] monitoring

we may actively monitor the use of the riot services (but have no obligation

variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking,
reducing toxic player behavior, and improving the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] please be
sure to read our [privacy notice](https://www.riotgames.com/en/privacy-notice)
for important details about how we obtain and process info in connection with
your use of the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] updates and modifications

#### 10.1. [CLS] [SEP] _will these terms change in the future?_ **(yes.)**

we may (and probably will) create updated versions of these terms in the
future as the riot services and applicable laws evolve. [CLS] [SEP] when we do, we’ll
inform you of the new agreement which will supersede and replace these terms. [CLS] [SEP]
you’ll be given an opportunity to review any new agreement we present to you
and decide whether you wish to agree to the revised terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you accept the
new agreement, you’ll be able to continue using the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] if you
decline the new agreement, you won’t be able to use the riot services anymore. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 10.2. [CLS] [SEP] _will the riot services stay the same?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] like kha’zix, they
will evolve.)**

in an effort to constantly improve the riot services, evolve our games and
keep the riot services, safe, fun, and secure, you agree that we may change,
modify, update, suspend, “nerf,” or restrict your access to any features or
parts of the riot services, including virtual goods (e.g., we might change
some features of virtual goods for regulatory or legal reasons or to improve
the game experience), and may require that you download and install updates to
any software required to support the riot services, at any time without
liability to you. [CLS] [SEP] you also understand and agree that any such changes or
updates to the riot services might change the system specifications necessary
to play our games, and in such a case, you, and not riot games, are
responsible for purchasing any necessary additional software or hardware in
order to access and play our games. [CLS] [SEP] you also understand and agree that we may
use background patching to automatically update our games and software with or
without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] boards and links

#### 11.1. [CLS] [SEP] _can i use the message boards?_ **(so long as you have a valid
account and act maturely.)**

if you have a valid, active account, you may use the boards section of our
website or apps (the “ **boards** ”) provided that you abide by the user rules
and any other posted rules. [CLS] [SEP] we may revoke your access to the boards at any
time if we believe you have breached the user rules. [CLS] [SEP] if you think we have made
a mistake, please contact us with details and we will review your case though
your account may be suspended during our review. [CLS] [SEP] use the boards at your own
risk. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor and police the
boards. [CLS] [SEP] we aren’t responsible for the content on the boards. [CLS] [SEP] except in cases
of our gross negligence or willful misconduct, we will have no liability to
you for any harm you may experience by using the boards. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 11.2. [CLS] [SEP] _what about links in the riot services? are those safe?_ **(like
bard’s magical journeys, you might find something dangerous waiting for you on
the other side. [CLS] [SEP] proceed with caution….)**

the riot services may contain links to websites operated by other parties. [CLS] [SEP]
again, we do not own or operate those other websites. [CLS] [SEP] we provide these links
to you as a convenience, or other users might be posting these links as user-
provided content. [CLS] [SEP] use these links and the corresponding external websites at
your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] we don’t control the linked sites, and we’re not responsible
for the content available there. [CLS] [SEP] such links don’t imply our endorsement of
info or material on any other site, and we disclaim all liability with regard
to your access to and use of such linked websites. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] notice and procedure for claims of copyright infringement

#### 12.1. [CLS] [SEP] _what should i do if someone is infringing my copyrighted work in
the riot services?_ **(send us a copyright take-down notice.)**

riot games respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same. [CLS] [SEP] it is
our policy to terminate accounts in appropriate circumstances of users who
infringe or are believed to infringe the rights of copyright holders. [CLS] [SEP] riot
games will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed
using the riot games website or other online network accessible through a
mobile device or other type of device (the “ **sites** ”) that are reported to
riot games’ designated copyright agent, identified in the sample notice below. [CLS] [SEP]

if you’re a copyright owner, are authorized to act on behalf of one, or
authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report
alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through the sites by
submitting a notice that contains all of the following:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or - if multiple copyrighted works are covered by this notice - you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  2. [CLS] [SEP] identify the material that you claim is infringing (or to be the subject of infringing activity) and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including at a minimum, if applicable, the url of the link shown on the site(s) where such material may be found. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  3. [CLS] [SEP] provide your mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, email address. [CLS] [SEP]
  

  4. [CLS] [SEP] include both of the following statements in the body of the notice: 
    * “i hereby state that i have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use).”
    * “i hereby state that the information in this notice is accurate and[, under penalty of perjury,]* that i am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that is allegedly infringed.”
  

  5. [CLS] [SEP] provide your full legal name and your electronic or physical signature. [CLS] [SEP]

* _you only need to include this language if you live in the united states of america._

deliver this notice (“ **notice** ”), with all items completed, to riot games’
copyright agent to the address of the riot games entity responsible for
providing the riot services in your region (see section 19). [CLS] [SEP] be sure to mark
it “attn: copyright agent” (and not “attn: legal dept) so it gets to the right
person quickly. [CLS] [SEP] you can send your notice instead by email to:
[copyright@riotgames.com](mailto: copyright@riotgames.com). [CLS] [SEP] this email address
is intended solely for the receipt of copyright take-down notices and not for
general inquiries or requests of riot games. [CLS] [SEP] attachments cannot be accepted at
the email address for security reasons. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, any notice submitted
electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that the notices are legal notices and that riot games may provide
copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to third parties,
at its discretion or as required by law. [CLS] [SEP] upon receipt of such a notice, riot
games will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate,
including removal of the challenged material from the sites. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] warranty disclaimer

#### 13.1. [CLS] [SEP] _does riot make any warranties about the riot services?_ **(it
depends where you are - prepare for some more lawyer shouting!)**

**_you assume all responsibility for the installation and use of, and results
obtained from the riot services (no matter where you are based)._**

also, if you are based in **north, central or south america** :

**_the riot services are provided to you on an “as is” and “as available”
basis without warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied. [CLS] [SEP]
you assume all responsibility for your use of the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, riot games disclaims all
warranties, express or implied, which might apply to the riot services,
including implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, any warranties that may arise from course of
dealing, course of performance or usage of trade, and any warranties as to the
accuracy, reliability or quality of any content or info contained within the
riot services._**

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification

#### 14.1. [CLS] [SEP] _if someone sues riot based on my use or misuse of the riot
services, do i have to pay for riot’s legal expenses?_ **(yes.)**

to the extent permitted by law, except in cases involving our gross negligence
or willful misconduct, you hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
riot games and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors from and
against any and all claims, lawsuits, losses, liabilities and costs that arise
or result from your misuse of the riot services, any violation by you of any
of the provisions of these terms (for example, if you use any hacks, cheats or
bots with the riot services or you infringe our ip rights), or any
infringement by you of any third party’s rights. [CLS] [SEP] riot games reserves the
right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume
the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
indemnification by you, in which event you’ll cooperate with riot games in
asserting any available defenses. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, if you use the riot services as part of a business operation
(something you’re not allowed to do) and we get sued because of something you
do in breach of these terms, you’ll have to defend us in court and pay for any
damages we incur. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

#### 15.1. [CLS] [SEP] _is there a limit on riot’s potential liability under these terms?_
**(yes.)**

**_to the extent permitted by law, our total liability to you (whether for
breach of this contract, negligence or for any other reason whatever) for any
loss, harm or damage suffered by you in connection with your downloading, use
and/or access of the riot services is limited to the total amounts paid by you
to riot during the six (6) months immediately prior to the time your cause of
action first arose._**

**_we only make the riot services available for domestic and private use. [CLS] [SEP] we
are not liable for business losses (such as any loss of profit, loss of
business, business interruption, loss of goodwill or loss of business
opportunity). [CLS] [SEP] we also won’t have responsibility for any damage which arises
because you failed to install any update when it is made available by riot
games or where you fail to maintain the minimum system specifications
required. [CLS] [SEP] separately, we are not responsible for: (i) any loss that was not
foreseeable at the time you entered into these terms; or (ii) any loss that we
both knew might happen only because of your special circumstances existing at
the time you entered into these terms (including all indirect damages)._**

**_despite anything else we say in these terms, we do not exclude or limit in
any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so, including
our liability for: (i) death or personal injury arising from our negligence;
(ii) our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (iii) willful or grossly
negligent behavior; (iv) for damage arising from a negligent breach of an
obligation that is essential for the performance of the contract by riot games
(“cardinal duties”) to the extent that is typical and foreseeable; (v) for any
guarantee given by us to you; or (vi) for any liability under a jurisdiction’s
applicable product liability legislation._**

**_you may also have specific rights under local law in addition to those set
out above._**

## 16\. [CLS] [SEP] governing law

#### 16.1. [CLS] [SEP] _what law applies to these terms or if we get into a dispute?_
**(that depends on where you live and what riot games entity provides you with
riot services.)**

please review below to determine what law applies to your use of the riot
services. [CLS] [SEP] irrespective of this choice-of-law, you may have the benefit of
other or additional mandatory rights or remedies provided by local law in
addition to those set out in these terms. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in these terms limits or
affects those rights. [CLS] [SEP]

**_if you live in north, central or south america (excluding brazil)_**

these terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these terms
will be governed by the federal arbitration act with respect to section 17
“dispute resolution,” and the laws of the state of california, without regard
to its conflict of laws provisions. [CLS] [SEP] except as otherwise expressly set out in
section 17 “dispute resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes
that you and riot games are not required to arbitrate will be the state and
federal courts located in the los angeles county, california, and you and riot
games each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. [CLS] [SEP]

**_if you live in south korea_**

these terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these terms
shall be governed by the laws of korea. [CLS] [SEP]

**_if you live in japan_**

these terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these terms
shall be governed by the laws of japan. [CLS] [SEP]

**_if you live in singapore, philippines, thailand, malaysia, indonesia and
cambodia (“sea”)_**

these terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these terms

these terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these terms
shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of ireland,
without regard to conflict of law principles. [CLS] [SEP]

## 17\. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution

#### 17.1. [CLS] [SEP] _i have an issue that i haven’t been able to sort out with riot
games. [CLS] [SEP] what’s the path to resolving this dispute?_ **(that depends on where
you live)**

if you live in:

  * **north, central or south america (except for brazil)** , you’ll be contracting and dealing with riot games inc. [CLS] [SEP] and you need to read part a (general dispute resolution terms) and part b of this section;
  

  * **south korea** , you’ll be contracting and dealing with riot games korea limited and you need to read part a (general dispute resolution terms) and part c of this section;
  

  * **japan** , you’ll be contracting and dealing with riot games, llc and you need to read part a (general dispute resolution terms) and part d of this section; 
  

  * **sea** , you’ll be contracting and dealing with riot games services pte. [CLS] [SEP] ltd. [CLS] [SEP] and you need to read part a (general dispute resolution terms) and part e of this section; or
  

  * **the european economic area, uk, brazil or any other region/country that isn’t listed above** , you’ll be contracting and dealing with riot games limited and you need to read part a (general dispute resolution terms). [CLS] [SEP] if you are based in the eu, part f of this section will also apply. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part a: general dispute resolution (no matter where you live)_**

#### 17.2. [CLS] [SEP] _if we have a dispute, can we 1 v 1 instead?_ **(no, we should
negotiate first.)**

disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties (justice doesn’t
come on swift wings outside valoran). [CLS] [SEP] in an effort to accelerate resolution
and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to these terms (“
**claim** ”), you and riot games agree to first attempt to informally
negotiate any claim for at least thirty (30) days (except as set out in
section 17.4 below). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.3. [CLS] [SEP] _how does negotiation get started?_ **(one of us sends the other
one a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)**

riot games will send its notice to the email address associated with your
account. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t have an account with riot games, we will send the notice
to the email address which you used to write to us about the claim. [CLS] [SEP] you must
send your notice to the riot games entity that is responsible for providing
the riot services to you (see section 19 for contact details). [CLS] [SEP] please note
that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory
limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a claim. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.4. [CLS] [SEP] _what claims are we agreeing to submit to negotiation?_ **(depends
on the type of dispute)**

to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and without limiting your
statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding, you and riot games agree that
the following claims are not subject to the other provisions in this part a
concerning negotiations: (i) any claims seeking to enforce or protect, or
concerning the validity of, any of your or riot games’ intellectual property
rights; (ii) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for
equitable relief (such as an injunction). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, either party may assert
an individual action in small claims court for claims that are within the
scope of such courts’ jurisdiction instead of litigation. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part b: dispute resolution for north, central or south america
(excluding brazil)_**

#### 17.5. [CLS] [SEP] _what the heck is arbitration?_ **(a private dispute resolution
method. [CLS] [SEP] no courtrooms or juries.)**

arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties
agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a
sitting judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes
privately and without the formality of going to court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration follows
different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited
review by courts. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.6. [CLS] [SEP] _will arbitration allow for the same type of relief as a court?_
**(yes.)**

the arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable
relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitrator’s decision (called an “ **award** ”) will consist of a written
statement stating the disposition of each claim and provide a concise written
statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
based. [CLS] [SEP] the award will be final and binding upon the parties, may be confirmed
by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then enforced like any other court
order or judgment. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.7. [CLS] [SEP] _what claims are we agreeing to submit to arbitration?_ **(almost
everything.)**

any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to these terms or
the riot services shall be resolved exclusively by private, binding
arbitration, rather than in court, except that qualifying small claims may be
submitted in small claims court and either party may seek emergency,
provisional relief before the appointment of an arbitrator as specified in
section 17.14, below. [CLS] [SEP] this means that, except for qualifying small claims
actions and emergency situations covered by section 17.14 below, **you and
riot games each waive the right to bring such claims to court, including the
right to a jury trial**. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.8. [CLS] [SEP] _can i bring a class or collective action claim?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] sorry for
more lawyer-shouting, but this is very important.)**

**_you and riot games agree that each of us may bring claims against the other
only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class or representative action or proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] unless both you and
riot games agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more
than one person’s or party’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] also, the
arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory
relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual
claim(s)._**

#### 17.9. [CLS] [SEP] _what issues will the arbitrator decide?_ **(pretty much
everything.)**

the arbitrator shall decide all issues in dispute between you and riot games. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.10. [CLS] [SEP] _who will administer the arbitration?_ **(jams, using its
“comprehensive arbitration rules.”)**

the arbitration shall be administered by [jams](https://www.jamsadr.com/)
pursuant to its [comprehensive arbitration rules and
procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/) (“
**jams rules** ”). [CLS] [SEP] a sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to these
rules. [CLS] [SEP] judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.11. [CLS] [SEP] _how does arbitration get started?_ **(one of us sends the other
one and jams a written notification describing the situation and relief
sought.)**

either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] the party commencing the
arbitration is called the “claimant.” a party who wishes to start arbitration
must submit a written demand for arbitration to jams and give notice to the
other party. [CLS] [SEP] jams provides a form demand for arbitration on its
[website](https://www.jamsadr.com/). [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.12. [CLS] [SEP] _who’s gonna pay for the arbitration?_ **(we pay filing fees for
lesser claims, but you have to pay filing fees for larger claims. [CLS] [SEP] we won’t
seek attorney fees for arbitration from you unless your claim is found to be
frivolous.)**

payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
the jams rules. [CLS] [SEP] we’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees
and expenses if your dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator
finds your dispute frivolous. [CLS] [SEP] if we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of
our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. [CLS] [SEP] if you
prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.13. [CLS] [SEP] _where and how will the arbitration take place?_ **(over the
phone, in writing, or in your hometown—your choice.)**

you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another
mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.14. [CLS] [SEP] _what about intellectual property infringement?_ **(either party
may go to court for the limited purpose of seeking a “provisional” remedy.)**

either party may seek emergency provisional remedies, including injunctive or
similar relief, pursuant to the jams rules or from a court of competent
jurisdiction located in los angeles county, california, where necessary to
protect that party’s rights and interests for the infringement or
misappropriation of intellectual property rights pending the appointment of an
arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.15. [CLS] [SEP] _can either of us tell our friends and twitter followers about the
arbitration?_ **(nope.)**

you and riot games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been
submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement
agreement, shall be kept confidential. [CLS] [SEP] however, the prevailing party in any
arbitration may file the arbitration award with any court of competent
jurisdiction in order to have that award confirmed in a court order or
judgment. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 17.16. [CLS] [SEP] _what if part of this agreement to arbitrate isn’t enforceable?_
**(the rest stays—we keep as much of it as can be enforced under the law.)**

you and riot games agree that if any part of this arbitration agreement is
declared unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the remainder of this
arbitration agreement shall be given full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] however, if
section 17.8, above (entitled, “can i bring a class action claim?”), or any
part of it is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration
agreement (i.e., all of part a of section 17) shall be severed from these
terms and all claims between you and riot games shall be exclusively decided
by a court located in los angeles county, california as set out in the
relevant part of section 16 above. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part c: dispute resolution for south korea_**

any dispute arising under these terms or riot services will be brought in the
court having jurisdiction in accordance with the code of korean civil
procedure. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part d: dispute resolution for japan_**

the tokyo district court shall have the exclusive jurisdiction in the first
instance over any dispute between riot games and you arising out of, or in
connection with, these terms or any riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part e: dispute resolution for sea_**

any dispute, controversy, claim or difference of any kind whatsoever arising
out of or in connection with these terms or riot services shall be referred to
and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the singapore
international arbitration centre (“ **siac** ”) in accordance with the
arbitration rules of the singapore international arbitration centre (“ **siac
rules** ”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this section. [CLS] [SEP] the seat of the arbitration shall
be singapore. [CLS] [SEP] the tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators and the
language of the arbitration shall be english. [CLS] [SEP]

#### **_part f: dispute resolution for eea residents_**

  

#### 17.17. [CLS] [SEP] _do i have other dispute resolution options?_

if you live in the eea, you may refer the dispute to the [european
commission’s online dispute resolution
platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooselanguage)
(see ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr). [CLS] [SEP]

within a year after you submit your complaint to us, you may also try to
resolve your dispute with riot games through a mediation procedure. [CLS] [SEP] this does
not limit your statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

## 18\. [CLS] [SEP] additional terms applicable to riot services

#### 18.1. [CLS] [SEP] _general terms_

you may access riot services we make available from certain authorized third

cause beyond riot games’ control such as: (a) hacking, cyber-attacks, data
corruption/loss (where we have taken the steps that would reasonably be taken
by companies like us to avoid this event occurring); or (b) acts of god, war,
terrorism, bomb-threats, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military
authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation
facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.5. [CLS] [SEP] _do these terms mean we’re partners?_ **(not in a legal sense,
no.)**

you agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
relationship exists between you and riot games as a result of these terms or
your use of the riot services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.6. [CLS] [SEP] _if i breach these terms and riot does nothing for a long time,
does that mean i’m off the hook?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve all of our rights.)**

riot games’ failure to enforce any provision of these terms shall in no way be
construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way
affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision after
that. [CLS] [SEP] any waiver by riot games of any provision, condition or requirement of
these terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply
with such provision, condition or requirement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.7. [CLS] [SEP] _what remedies are available to riot games if i breach these
terms?_

you agree that riot games would suffer irreparable harm if a breach of certain
of these terms (such as section 3.2) was not specifically enforced and that
damages would not be an adequate remedy for riot games as a result. [CLS] [SEP] we may
rely upon this section to ask a court for injunctive relief or specific
performance. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.8. [CLS] [SEP] _if i need to send a legal notice to riot, where do i send it?_
**(we hope you never need to send us a legal notice, but if you do….)**

except as otherwise expressly provided in these terms, all notices given by
you or required under these terms shall be in writing and addressed to the
riot games entity that provides you with the riot services at issue. [CLS] [SEP] see
section 19 for the address of the relevant riot games entity. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.9. [CLS] [SEP] _can i play the game if the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] government thinks i might be a
terrorist or i live in an embargoed country?_ **(no.)**

much of the riot services are developed in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] so you cannot use them if:
(1) the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury
department lists you as a specially designated national and/or blocked person;
(2) the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of
commerce lists you on its denied persons list or lists of parties of concern;
or (3) you’re on any similar list promulgated by an official agency or
department of the united states government. [CLS] [SEP] you warrant and represent that
you’re not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
embargoed country. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.10. [CLS] [SEP] _if part of these terms is invalidated, what happens to the rest?_
**(like zac, these terms might lose a part or two, but what’s left lives
on.)**

except as otherwise provided in these terms, if any provision of these terms
is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
considered severed from these terms and the remainder of these terms shall
continue in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.11. [CLS] [SEP] _are these silly headings legally binding?_ **(no. [CLS] [SEP] these headings
are just our lawyers’ way of trying to be engaging and funny. [CLS] [SEP] other lawyers
find these headings to be appropriately engaging and funny.)**

the headings and parentheticals in these terms are provided for informational
and entertainment purposes only. [CLS] [SEP] they have no legal effect whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.12. [CLS] [SEP] _how long does this agreement last?_ **(for as long as you use the
riot services or until your account is terminated. [CLS] [SEP] some provisions have been
chronoshifted, though, and last forever.)**

these terms begins on the date you first accept them and last for as long as
you use or maintain an account on the riot services. [CLS] [SEP] however, sections 2.3,
3.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 6, 8, and 13-19 inclusive, shall survive the
termination of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

#### 20.13. [CLS] [SEP] _where we say “including” in these terms, is that language
limiting?_ **(no.)**

whenever we use “including” in these terms, we mean “including without
limitation.”

**you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand these terms, and
that by selecting the “accept” button below or otherwise using or accessing
the riot services, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions
set out in these terms.**
