# copyright policy

  

**copyright and your deviantart submission**

here at deviantart we respect the rights of all artists and creative people
worldwide and we expect our members to also demonstrate that respect and
assist us in creating a beneficial and positive atmosphere for all deviantart
visitors and members. [CLS] [SEP]

the bottom line is: just about anything that is on this site, on the web, on
tv, on cd's, on dvd's, in books & in magazines is probably copyrighted by
someone. [CLS] [SEP]

copyright can be a confusing territory for many people. [CLS] [SEP] in many cases the
natural confusion over the sometimes varied circumstances surrounding
copyright will lead people to rely on rumor or myth more often than the actual
law which naturally confuses the matter even more. [CLS] [SEP]

in this document we will attempt to eliminate some of the confusion and
counter many of the myths surrounding copyright and to present clearly the
deviantart policies and practices with regard to copyright. [CLS] [SEP] the availability
of this document should not be construed as rendering legal or other
professional advice, and this document is not a substitute for the advice of
an attorney. [CLS] [SEP] if you require legal advice, you should seek the services of a
qualified attorney. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**how do i get copyright?**

under most national laws and international copyright treaties you receive a
copyright automatically in any original work as you make it. [CLS] [SEP] registration may
be required to exercise some rights, like commencing a lawsuit. [CLS] [SEP] copyright does
not protect ideas. [CLS] [SEP] copyright protects the expression of ideas or the ways in
which an idea is materially placed or expressed in the work. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**what is copyright infringement?**

to simplify this question, copyright infringement occurs when you do certain
things with a creative work which someone else produced without first getting
the proper permission. [CLS] [SEP]

some examples of copyright infringement (this is only a partial listing) can
include:

  * placing someone else's photograph or creative work online without proper permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * using a creative work commercially without permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * adapting someone else's creative work found in one medium to another medium, such as making a book into a movie or a photograph into a painting. [CLS] [SEP]
  * modifying or editing a creative work without proper permission. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**how can i avoid infringing on someone's copyright?**

the best way to avoid infringing on the rights of another creative person is
to use your skill, talent and imagination to create your own completely
original work. [CLS] [SEP] when we use the word 'original' we don't mean that you must
come up with an idea which hasn't been used before - recall that copyright
does not protect ideas. [CLS] [SEP] when used in reference to copyright "original" means
that you created your work without referencing or deliberately copying anyone
else's work during the process. [CLS] [SEP]

ensure that all parts of your work, both visual and audio, are your own
original creations. [CLS] [SEP] if you have used materials which are owned by other people
or companies make certain that you have obtained proper permission or
licensing for the use before you place your work online. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also obtain permission to use a copyrighted work by license. [CLS] [SEP] you can
read more [here](https://help.deviantart.com/157/) and
[here](https://help.deviantart.com/193/). [CLS] [SEP]

  

**what sort of things are copyrighted?**

the easy answer to this question is that just about any creative work that is
less than 150 years old you might find should be considered copyrighted by
default. [CLS] [SEP]

a work is not required to have a copyright statement printed on it or near it
in order to be considered copyrighted so do not assume that the work is
unprotected simply because you cannot see a notice written anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]

also do not confuse the fact that a work is publicly available with the idea
that it is in the public domain or free for use. [CLS] [SEP] being easy to find on the
internet does not affect a work's copyrighted status. [CLS] [SEP]

there are many exceptions to the 150 year guideline, but you are best advised
to obtain legal advice from an expert if you intend to rely on the possibility
that a modern work is not copyrighted. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**some cautions**

  * in most cases it does not matter how much of the material you have used, whether it's a single frame, a few moments of audio, a short clip of video or any other sampling it's still considered to be protected by copyright and you still require the owner's permission for use. [CLS] [SEP]
  * it doesn't matter how you obtained the material, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * it doesn't matter whether or not you've credited the proper owner, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * it doesn't matter if you are not selling it or making a profit, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * it doesn't matter if you can find other people using things without permission, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * it doesn't matter if you've edited it a little bit or made a few alterations, if it's recognizable it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. [CLS] [SEP]
  * read licenses carefully to understand the type of permission they provide. [CLS] [SEP] for example, there are many versions of the [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) \- each giving different permissions. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**what happens when you submit infringing works to deviantart?**

any copyright owner following the procedures in this copyright policy can
require deviantart to remove his or her copyrighted content in use by a member
of deviantart. [CLS] [SEP] when through the proper notice we become aware that a
submission to deviantart infringes upon the copyrights of another artist,
creative person or company, we will immediately delete it. [CLS] [SEP] this is a legal
requirement which we fulfill immediately; you will not receive an advanced
warning and you will not be given an opportunity to 'fix it'. [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that a submission on deviantart infringes on your copyright you
may either report the submission using our internal reporting system or send
us a copyright notice via mail or email. [CLS] [SEP] a member of staff will review your
notice and act accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that one of your submissions was removed in error you may
contact our helpdesk or otherwise file a counter notice. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are found to repeatedly post infringing content, your account will be
suspended and serious offenders will have their account banned and
deactivated. [CLS] [SEP] we consider three strikes as an indication of being a repeat
infringer subject to ban. [CLS] [SEP] if you are found deliberately misrepresenting the
copyrighted work of another as your own your account will be immediately
banned and deactivated. [CLS] [SEP]

the copyright owner may also decide to sue you directly if you infringe his or
her copyright in posting content to deviantart. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**what about "fair use"**

"fair use" is the notion that some public and private uses of copyrighted
works should not require the permission of a copyright owner. [CLS] [SEP] these
circumstances are very limited, complex to analyze under the law and require
the help of expert advice from a lawyer. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend you talk to your own
lawyer if you want to know more about fair use as it applies to the work you
are doing. [CLS] [SEP] if it turns out that it isn't fair use, you may be liable for very
serious money damages. [CLS] [SEP]

to learn more about fair use you can go

[here](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/copyright_and_fair_use_overview/chapter9/),
[here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/fairuse/), and
[here](http://w2.eff.org/ip/eff_fair_use_faq.php). [CLS] [SEP]

  

**if you take my work down am i protected from a lawsuit?**

no. [CLS] [SEP] even if deviantart takes an infringing work down, you may still be
responsible for very significant damages if the copyright owner decides to sue
you. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**notification of copyright infringement**

**instructions for copyright owners**

this section contains the formal requirements of the copyright act with

authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed. [CLS] [SEP]

if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single
notification, a representative list of such works at that site. [CLS] [SEP]

3\. [CLS] [SEP] identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be
