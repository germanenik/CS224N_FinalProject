[CLS] [SEP] if you are at least age 16 and signing up for an account and tutoring sessions for yourself, your tutoring sessions will occur online and be recorded via videoconferencing technology. [CLS] [SEP] your video, voice, text chat, or images displayed via screen sharing will be collected online as a part of that recording. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, to the extent you email in connection with the service (e.g., with a tutor), we will collect the email correspondence. [CLS] [SEP]

      * submit a help request, a customer services inquiry or other inquiry to us, or fill in any other forms for the purposes of receiving our services;

(including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the
time the location information was recorded, and we may use that information to
customize the services with location-based information, advertising, and
features. [CLS] [SEP] some of these services require us to associate location data with
your device id and other information we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP]

    * cookies and other trackers. [CLS] [SEP] 
      * **what is a cookie?** cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. [CLS] [SEP] a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear gif) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the sites, analyzing how users navigate around the sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors. [CLS] [SEP] some ad companies and game developers use “flash cookies” for ads and games that use flash media technology. [CLS] [SEP] we use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. [CLS] [SEP] we use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the services and generally improve your experience. [CLS] [SEP] ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our sites and third party websites that are more relevant to you and your interests.there are two broad categories of cookies: 
        * first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]
        * third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of
time. [CLS] [SEP] some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while
your browser is open. [CLS] [SEP] these are deleted automatically once you close your
browser. [CLS] [SEP] other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive
after your browser is closed. [CLS] [SEP] they can be used by websites to recognize your
computer when you open your browser and browse the internet again. [CLS] [SEP]

      * how do we use cookies? we use cookies to: 
        * track traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with our services;
        * understand the total number of visitors to our sites on an ongoing basis and the types of internet browsers (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] chrome, safari or edge), operating systems (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] windows or mac os), and screen resolutions used by our visitors;
        * monitor and analyze the performance of our services and to continually improve them;
        * customize and enhance your online experience; and
        * enable dictionary and third-party advertising both on and off our sites. [CLS] [SEP]

third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through
the services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or
similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for
information about their cookies and other practices. [CLS] [SEP] we do not control the
practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their
interactions with you. [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to read their privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

      * _what types of cookies do we use?_ the types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with the services can be classified into one of the five categories below. [CLS] [SEP] we’ve set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties set in the following table. [CLS] [SEP]  
**type of cookie** | **what it does**  
---|---  
strictly necessary cookies | these cookies are essential to operate the sites
and provide the services by helping us provide basic functionality such as
loading and rendering pages on the sites and enabling your navigation around
the sites and use of certain features. [CLS] [SEP] they are also used to identify and
prevent fraud and improve security. [CLS] [SEP]  
functionality cookies | functionality cookies record information about choices
you’ve made and allow us to tailor the sites to you. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies mean that
when you continue to use or come back to the sites, we can provide you with
our services as you have asked for them to be provided. [CLS] [SEP] for example, these
cookies allow us to store language preference. [CLS] [SEP] they may also be used to
provide certain functionality such as playing video content. [CLS] [SEP]  
performance / analytics cookies | we use performance/analytics cookies to
analyze how the sites are accessed, used, or is performing in order to provide
you with a better user experience and to maintain, operate and continually
improve the sites. [CLS] [SEP] for example, these cookies allow us to:

        * better understand our website visitors so that we can improve how we present our content;
        * test different design ideas for particular pages, such as our homepage;
        * collect information about site visitors such as where they are located and what browsers they are using;
        * determine the number of unique users of the sites;
        * improve the sites by measuring any errors that occur; and
        * conduct research and diagnostics to improve product offerings. [CLS] [SEP]  
advertising and tracking cookies | as you use our sites, you will notice that
it includes advertising. [CLS] [SEP] we allow third party advertising companies to place
cookies on our sites. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies enable such companies to track your
activity across various sites where they display ads and record your
activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you
browse the web. [CLS] [SEP]  
cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you’ve seen an ad or a
type of ad, and how long it has been since you’ve last seen it. [CLS] [SEP] this
information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you
see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads. [CLS] [SEP]  
social media cookies | third parties that make their applications available
through/on our sites may set their own cookies in order to track the
performance of their applications or customize those applications for you. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our
sites (e.g., facebook, twitter, or instagram), the social network that has
created the button will record that you have done this. [CLS] [SEP] because of how cookies
work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the
data in cookies used by us. [CLS] [SEP] some pages of our website may also contain
embedded content, such as video content from youtube, and these sites may set
their own cookies. [CLS] [SEP]  
      * _cookie controls._ you can control your cookie settings as explained below. [CLS] [SEP] we may disclose your opt-out choices to third parties so that they can honor your preferences in accordance with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] 
        * web browser controls. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. [CLS] [SEP] users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones we uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies. [CLS] [SEP] these settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. [CLS] [SEP] in order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the “help” option in your browser for more details. [CLS] [SEP]
        * [cookie settings in microsoft edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy)
        * [cookie settings in internet explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)
        * [cookie settings in firefox](http://support.mozilla.com/en-us/kb/cookies)
        * [cookie settings in chrome](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647)
        * [cookie settings in safari web](http://support.apple.com/kb/ph5042) and [ios.](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1677)

we note that an optional browser setting known as do not track allows you to
express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-
parties. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated dnt
signals, as the internet industry is currently still working toward defining
exactly what dnt means, what it means to comply with dnt, and a common
approach to responding to dnt. [CLS] [SEP]

        * flash cookie controls. [CLS] [SEP] you can manage the use of flash technologies with the flash management tools available at adobe’s website. [CLS] [SEP]
        * web-beacons.

[CLS] [SEP] see the “help” section of your email client for instructions. [CLS] [SEP] please see the all about cookies website for further information about managing your options. [CLS] [SEP]
        * mobile apps. [CLS] [SEP] with respect to our mobile apps, you can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. [CLS] [SEP] also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]

    * except for small claims disputes or claims related to intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to the services resolved in court. [CLS] [SEP] instead, disputes relating in any way to the services must be submitted to binding arbitration administered by jams.

[CLS] [SEP] the most recent version of the jams rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator, not the court, will resolve the issue of arbitrability. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the services is personal to you and us and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining jams fees and costs. [CLS] [SEP] for any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all jams fees and costs. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to an in-person arbitration hearing in your hometown area. [CLS] [SEP] any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof may enter judgment of any award the arbitrator renders. [CLS] [SEP]
    * you have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email to privacy@dictionary.com. [CLS] [SEP] in order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] by opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the section, “governing law and forum selection.”
    * if any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these terms of use; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]
  13. [CLS] [SEP] general terms. [CLS] [SEP] these terms and any posted rules on the services constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
