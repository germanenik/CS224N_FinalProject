# privacy policy

welcome to clockify's privacy policy!

please note that this privacy policy applies to personal data that is
collected and processed by coing inc., having its registered seat at 2100 geng
road, suite 210, palo alto, ca 94303, usa ( **"coing"** , **"we"** , **"our"**
or **"us"** ). [CLS] [SEP]

coing, as a data controller, collects and processes personal data relating to
interactions on the website (as defined in section 1 of the [terms of
use](/terms)). [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy describes how coing uses and protects any
information that you give us. [CLS] [SEP]

we believe in full transparency, which is why we keep our privacy policy
simple and easy to understand. [CLS] [SEP]

we strongly urge you to read this privacy policy and make sure that you fully
understand and agree with it. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree to this privacy policy,
please do not access or otherwise use the website. [CLS] [SEP]

any capitalized but undefined term in this privacy policy shall have the
meaning given to it in the definitions section of the [terms of use](/terms). [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] definitions

when we say **"you"** , **"your"** or **"data subject"** we mean any natural
person that shares personal data with us via website. [CLS] [SEP]

when we say **"processing"** we mean any operation or set of operations which
is performed on personal data or sets of personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this includes
activities such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage,
adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. [CLS] [SEP]

when we say **"personal data"** or **"data"** we mean any information relating
to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural
person is one who can be identified, either directly or indirectly. [CLS] [SEP] therefore,
data about a company or any legal entity is not considered to be personal data
but registering on behalf of a legal entity may include sharing personal data. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, the information in relation to one-person companies may
constitute personal data where it allows the identification of a natural
person. [CLS] [SEP] the rules also apply to all personal data relating to natural persons
in the course of professional activity, such as the employees of a company or
organization, business e-mail addresses like
**"firstname.surname@company.com"**. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy does not apply to
information from which no individual can reasonably be identified (anonymized
information). [CLS] [SEP]

when we say **"data processors"** or **"processor"** we mean any natural or
legal person who processes the data on behalf of the data controller. [CLS] [SEP] in some
cases, coing is a data processor and in others, data controller (as further
explained in section 2). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may use the services of various
service providers to process your data more effectively. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, they
are either our processors or sub-processors. [CLS] [SEP]

when we say **"cookies"** we mean small pieces of data stored on your device
(computer or mobile device). [CLS] [SEP] this information is used to track your use of the
website and to compile statistical reports on website activity. [CLS] [SEP] for further
information about the use of cookies and how you can manage them, please read
our [cookie policy](/cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

when we say **"consent"** we mean your explicit consent on the processing of
personal data. [CLS] [SEP] persons who are 15 years of age or older may give free consent
to the processing of their personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] data controller or data processor

in relation to your personal data processed on or via the website and the
service, coing may be either a data controller or data processor. [CLS] [SEP]

when coing acts in the capacity of a data controller, coing determines the
purposes and means of the processing of personal data. [CLS] [SEP] the purpose of data
processing is the reason why we process your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] the table in
section 4.1 of the privacy policy presents the purposes and legal basis for
data processing. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, coing is responsible for your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

apart from section 4.2, this privacy policy primarily contains information on
processing your data in the capacity of a data controller. [CLS] [SEP] should you have any
inquiries, or you wish to exercise any of the rights of a data subject
stipulated in section 10, please contact us:

  * coing inc. [CLS] [SEP]
  * 2100 geng road, suite 210
  * palo alto, ca 94303
  * usa
  * email: [support@clockify.me](mailto:support@clockify.me)

by using the service, you may disclose, share, record, or otherwise use
various types of data via a workspace as the user content. [CLS] [SEP] the type of user
content is determined by the person that owns the workspace and not by us. [CLS] [SEP] the
extent to which personal data is processed while using the service also
depends on the clockify functionalities that the owner of the workspace
decides to use. [CLS] [SEP] in that event, coing is a data processor and data controller
is the owner of the workspace. [CLS] [SEP] thus, coing does not analyze, disclose or
access such data unless a user (including an enterprise as a user) sends a
request for support and, in these cases, the access is limited to enabling the
functioning of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

given that coing strongly supports the principle of transparency of personal
data processing, despite being a data processor, coing made an additional
effort to explain personal data processing via the service in section 4.2 of
this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] the information contained therein outlines how personal
data processing via clockify functions in general. [CLS] [SEP] nevertheless, should you
wish to send an inquiry or exercise any of your data subject's rights which
you may have under the applicable data protection legislation to the owner of
the workspace, please contact such owner of the relevant workspace as data
controller. [CLS] [SEP]

please also note that we do not collect or process your personal data if you
are an end user of server clockify. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, client (the company that has
clockify installed on their server) is responsible for your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

if you represent a user that falls under the scope of application of the gdpr
or similar data protection legislation, you may sign the data protection
addendum to these terms of use ( **"dpa"** ), with coing as a data processor
based outside the eea. [CLS] [SEP] the dpa includes the standard contractual clauses
adopted by the european commission, as applicable, and reflects the parties'
agreement with respect to the terms governing the processing of personal data
under the clockify's [terms of use](/terms). [CLS] [SEP] signing the dpa will be
considered as an amendment to the agreement (within the meaning of section 1
of the [terms of use](/terms)) and will be considered to form a part of the
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

if would like to sign a dpa with us, please contact us at
[support@clockify.me](mailto:support@clockify.me) for more information. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] what data do we collect about you and when?

we may collect and receive information about you in various ways:

  * (i) information you provide through the use of the service (for example, by creating the account on cloud clockify). [CLS] [SEP]
  * (ii) information you decide to provide through getting in touch with us via [support@clockify.me](mailto:support@clockify.me). [CLS] [SEP]
  * (iii) information we collect through the use of cookies in accordance with our cookie policy (for example, your time zone). [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] personal data we process

### 4.1 coing as data controller

data we collect | purpose | legal basis | retention  
---|---|---|---  
**email address, password, time zone and sometimes profile photo, name and
personal api key**  
  
(if the user decides to provide such personal data). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
the user will also obtain the user id so that we can identify that user in the
future. [CLS] [SEP]  | creating and maintaining a user account on the website according to
the [terms of use](/terms). [CLS] [SEP] | processing is necessary for the performance of
the agreement (as defined in section 1 of the [terms of use](/terms)). [CLS] [SEP] without
providing an email address, password and time zone, the user may not create
the user account. [CLS] [SEP]  | until the account is deleted in accordance with the
[terms of use](/terms). [CLS] [SEP]  
**financial data**  
  
such as name, address, bank account and payment card details. [CLS] [SEP] the payer may
not be the user subscribing to the paid plan, so it is possible to receive the
information from another user. [CLS] [SEP]  | when subscribing to any of the paid plans or
when changing any paid plan in accordance with the [terms of use](/terms),
this information is being collected by a third party processor. [CLS] [SEP] | processing
is necessary for the userâs performance of the agreement which includes
providing additional features based on the selected paid plan. [CLS] [SEP]  | we keep only
the last four digits of the credit card number under subscription billing info
until such agreement is terminated and for the period necessary to comply with
the applicable financial and tax accounting and other statutory obligations in
accordance with the applicable law (section 22 of the [terms of use](/terms)). [CLS] [SEP]  
**additional data**  
  
i.e., data you decide to share with us. [CLS] [SEP] | if you send us an inquiry at
[support@clockify.me](mailto:support@clockify.me) or otherwise request
support, we will collect data you decide to share with us. [CLS] [SEP] | processing of
personal data is either necessary to provide a service or part thereof, or the
processing is based on your consent. [CLS] [SEP] | if the processing is based on your
consent, we keep the information until you withdraw your consent or for one
year, whichever date comes first. [CLS] [SEP]  
**email address**  
  
if you decide to sign up for our newsletter, we use your email address. [CLS] [SEP] | this
newsletter allows us to inform you of the new features of the service,
updates, as well as other news relevant to the company. [CLS] [SEP] | processing is based
on your consent. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time,
without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent prior to
such withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP] you may unsubscribe from receiving a newsletter from us. [CLS] [SEP] if
you wish to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of each
email. [CLS] [SEP] | we may use your email for this purpose until you unsubscribe or until
you delete your user account. [CLS] [SEP]  
**email address**  
  
(when provided by other users) | users may invite non-users via clockify to
join the workspace, in which case they provide the non-userâs email address. [CLS] [SEP]
| processing is necessary for the performance of the agreement between us and
the user who provided the information and it is also in the userâs
legitimate interest. [CLS] [SEP] | after sending the message to you we do not keep your
personal data unless you decide to become a user, in which case other purposes
apply. [CLS] [SEP]  
**information necessary for identification** | to allow data subjects from eea
to exercise their rights in accordance with this privacy policy, as defined in
section 10. [CLS] [SEP] | processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
which the controller is subject to. [CLS] [SEP] | we keep this information for a period of
one year. [CLS] [SEP]  
**other personal data** | for the prevention and detection of fraud, money
laundering or other crimes or to respond to a binding request from a public
authority or court. [CLS] [SEP] | the processing is necessary to comply with legal and
regulatory obligations. [CLS] [SEP] | in accordance with the applicable statutory
deadlines. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
### 4.1 coing as data processor

as previously stated, concerning your personal data processed on or via the
service, coing is a data processor and the owner of the workspace is the data
controller. [CLS] [SEP] coing processes personal data following instructions from the data
controller and under the [terms of use](/terms) and dpa (if any). [CLS] [SEP] the purpose
of such personal data processing is productivity management during work hours
of the team where the owner of the workspace may get an accurate report of the
workweek, improve project profitability, compile reports for the clients,
track attendance of employees and/or other team members and track their work. [CLS] [SEP]

as a processor, coing is permitted to collect, use, disclose and/or otherwise
process your personal data only following the instructions of the owner of the
workspace. [CLS] [SEP]

**1\. [CLS] [SEP] processing prior to using the service**

  * the owner of the workspace shares your email address to enable you to access the service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the owner of the workspace may assign you tasks and projects. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have any questions regarding the legal basis for such personal data processing, please contact the owner of the workspace who invited you to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] processing during the usage of the service**

if you decide to accept the invitation to use the service, you will be
required to create an account. [CLS] [SEP] to create the user account, you will need to
share your email address and password. [CLS] [SEP]

you manage personal data you share via your account such as name and surname,
photo, email data (personal email address and/or work email address). [CLS] [SEP]

in the course of the use of the service we may process system usage data, ip
address, work position, attendance at work, time-tracking data you inserted
(for example, the time you started work, the time you finished work, tasks or
projects worked on), application integration data, navigational data
(including website usage information such as interactions with clockify, and
other electronic data submitted, stored, sent, or received by the data
controller via the service. [CLS] [SEP]

if the owner of the workspace is an enterprise, depending on whether certain
clockify functionalities have been activated, we may collect screenshots of
your desktop screen in low resolution (blurred) and/or gps location and/or
names of applications used on your computer, websites visited and time spent
(if you decide to share such data). [CLS] [SEP]

screenshot is an extra feature, which an enterprise can enable to generate
screenshots randomly every 5 minutes while the timer is running on a desktop
app. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on screenshots and processing of personal data,
please see [here](/help/extra-features/screenshots). [CLS] [SEP]

gps tracking is an extra feature, which an enterprise can enable to track who
is currently working on-site and everyone's location history throughout the
day while the timer is running. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on gps tracking and
processing of personal data, please see [here](/help/extra-features/gps-
tracking). [CLS] [SEP]

auto tracker tracks websites and programs that you view for more than 10
seconds (apps you use for less than that won't show up). [CLS] [SEP] this data is stored
locally on your device and may be visible to other users in your workspace
only after you add it as an entry from the auto tracker table. [CLS] [SEP] for more
information please see [here](/help/apps/mac-desktop-app#auto-tracker). [CLS] [SEP]

coing does not undertake analysis of any special categories of personal data
(including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data,
health data, sex life or sexual orientation) and clockify functionalities are
not meant to be used for the processing of any such personal data. [CLS] [SEP] however, if
you decide to provide such personal data to us or data controller via the
service, you will be deemed to have consented to such processing of the data. [CLS] [SEP]

for more information on who may access personal data, please see
[here](/help/users/who-can-do-what). [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] what we do not do?

coing will never:

  * -- sell any kind of personal information or data
  * -- disclose this information to marketers or third parties not specified in section 7
  * -- process your data in any way other than stated in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] personal data security

we take administrative, technical, organizational and other measures to ensure
the appropriate level of security of personal data we process. [CLS] [SEP] upon assessing
whether a measure is adequate and which level of security is appropriate, we
consider the nature of the personal data we are processing and the nature of
the processing operations we perform, the risks to which you are exposed by
our processing activities, the costs of the implementation of security
measures and other relevant matters in the particular circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

some of the measures we apply include access authorization control,
information classification (and handling thereof), protection of integrity and
confidentiality, data backup, firewalls, data encryption and other appropriate
measures. [CLS] [SEP] we equip our staff with the appropriate knowledge and understanding
of the importance and confidentiality of your personal data security. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] with whom do we share your personal data?

coing utilizes external processors for certain processing activities. [CLS] [SEP] we use
information audits to identify, categorize and record all personal data that
is processed outside the company, so that the information, processing
activity, processor and legal basis are all recorded, reviewed and easily
accessible. [CLS] [SEP]

we have strict due diligence procedures and measures in place and review,
assess and background check all processors prior to forming a business
relationship. [CLS] [SEP] we obtain company documents, certifications, references and
ensure that the processor is adequate, appropriate and effective for the task
we are employing them for. [CLS] [SEP]

we audit their processes and activities prior to contract and during the
contract period to ensure compliance with the data protection regulations and
review any codes of conduct that oblige them to confirm compliance. [CLS] [SEP]

this is the list of processors and sub-processors with whom we share your
personal data:

processor/subprocessor | role | seat  
---|---|---  
the rocket science group, llc (mailchimp) | email services based on cloud |
usa  
google, inc. [CLS] [SEP] | analytics | usa  
amazon web services, inc. [CLS] [SEP] | cloud infrastructure (iaas) | usa  
sendgrid, inc. [CLS] [SEP] | e-mail services based on cloud | usa

zendesk, inc. [CLS] [SEP] | email and chat support | usa  
coing doo | software development | serbia  
  
we may also share your personal data with our outside accountants, legal
counsels and auditors. [CLS] [SEP]

please keep in mind that, subject to your instructions to us while using the
service, your data may be shared with third parties in the following
situations:

  * -- if you join another user's workspace;
  * -- if you invite another user to join you workspace;
  * -- if you invite a non-user to join clockify;
  * -- if you decide to share user content from your workspace to persons who do not have an account on clockify by providing links to such user content. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] international transfer of your personal data

we may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one you reside
in. [CLS] [SEP] given that we follow internal rules for the protection of personal data
that are stricter than the applicable law (see section 22 of the [terms of
use](/terms)), in these cases, we transfer your personal data only:

  * 1\. [CLS] [SEP] to the countries within the eea;
  * 2\. [CLS] [SEP] to the countries which ensure an adequate level of protection;
  * 3\. [CLS] [SEP] to the countries which do not belong to those specified under item 1. [CLS] [SEP] and 2, but only by applying the appropriate safeguard measures. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] how long do we keep your data?

the period for which we store your personal data depends on a particular
purpose for the processing of personal data, as explained in detail in section
4. [CLS] [SEP] we retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for legal
or business purposes. [CLS] [SEP] in determining data retention periods, we take into
consideration the applicable law (see section 22 of the terms of use),
contractual obligations, and the expectations and requirements of our users. [CLS] [SEP]
when we no longer need personal information, or when you request us to delete
your information, where this is legal, we will securely delete or destroy it. [CLS] [SEP]

however, as an exception to the retention periods in section 4 the data may be
processed to determine, pursue or defend claims and counterclaims. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] your rights

given that transparency is one of our cornerstone principles, we grant data
subjects certain rights in relation to their personal data. [CLS] [SEP] these rights may
be exercised by data subject when coing operates as a data controller. [CLS] [SEP]

if your inquiry or exercise of any of the data subject's rights relates to the
data on a workspace processed as explained in section 4.2 of the privacy
policy, please contact the owner of the relevant workspace via which your
personal data has been processed. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event coing receives a request for exercising any of these rights
directly from a data

subject, we are obliged to notify the owner of the relevant workspace before
responding to such a request. [CLS] [SEP]

### right of access

you can send us a request for a copy of the personal data we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP]

we have ensured that appropriate measures have been taken to provide such in a
concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and
plain language. [CLS] [SEP] such information is provided in writing free of charge. [CLS] [SEP] it may
be provided by other means when authorized by the data subject and with prior
verification as to the subject's identity. [CLS] [SEP]

information is provided to the data subject at the earliest convenience, but
at a maximum of 30 days from the date the request was received. [CLS] [SEP] where the
retrieval or provision of information is particularly complex or is subject to
a valid delay, the period may be extended by two further months where
necessary. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to correction of your personal data

if the personal data we have about you is incorrect, you have the right to
request that we correct those data. [CLS] [SEP] where notified of inaccurate data by the
data subject, we will rectify the error within 30 days and inform any third
party of the rectification if we have disclosed the personal data in question
to them. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to erasure

you have the right to request from us that your personal data is deleted in
certain circumstances including:

  * -- the personal data are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected;
  * -- you withdraw your consent (where the processing was based on consent);
  * -- you object to the processing and no overriding legitimate grounds are justifying us processing the personal data;
  * -- the personal data have been unlawfully processed; or
  * -- to comply with a legal obligation. [CLS] [SEP]

however, this right does not apply where, for example, the processing is
necessary:

  * -- to comply with a legal obligation; or
  * -- for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to restriction of processing

if the accuracy of the personal data is contested, you consider the processing
is unlawful but you do not want it erased, we no longer need the personal data
but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims
or you have objected to the processing and verification, you can exercise your
right to the restriction of processing. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to data portability

where you have provided personal data to us, you have the right to receive
such personal data back in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
format, and to have those data transmitted to a third-party data controller
without hindrance but in each case only where:

  * -- the processing is carried out by automated means; and
  * -- the processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to withdraw the consent

if you have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer
of your personal data, you have the right to fully or partly withdraw your
consent. [CLS] [SEP] once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your
consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to
which you originally consented unless there is another legal ground for the
processing. [CLS] [SEP]

### right to lodge a complaint

if you have any concerns or requests in relation to your personal data, please
contact us at [support@clockify.me](mailto:support@clockify.me) and we will
respond as soon as possible but not later than within 30 days. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to privacy policy

we reserve the right to change privacy policy from time to time at our sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if we make any changes, we will publish the new rules on this web
page and, if we have your email, we will notify you directly. [CLS] [SEP]

where you have previously consented to our privacy policy, your continued use
of the website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of the updated
rules. [CLS] [SEP]
