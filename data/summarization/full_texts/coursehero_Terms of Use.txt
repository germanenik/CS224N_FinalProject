subject to the following terms. [CLS] [SEP] by agreeing to these terms, you expressly
acknowledge that you understand the terms (including the dispute resolution
and arbitration provisions contained herein) and accept all of them. [CLS] [SEP] if you do
not agree to all of the following, you may not use or access the services in
any manner. [CLS] [SEP]

######  1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction and general terms

welcome to [www.coursehero.com](/). [CLS] [SEP] please read on to learn the rules and
restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and
applications (the “services”). [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions, comments, or
concerns regarding these terms or the services, please contact us at [[email
protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#2b585e5b5b44595f6b48445e59584e434e594405484446) or 2000 seaport
blvd., 3rd floor, redwood city, ca 94063. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms of use (the “terms”) are a binding contract between you and course
hero, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (“course hero,” “we” and “us”). [CLS] [SEP] you must agree to and accept all of
the terms, or you don’t have the right to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] your using the
services in any way means that you agree to all of these terms, and these
terms will remain in effect while you use the services. [CLS] [SEP] these terms include
the provisions in this document, as well as those in the course hero [privacy
policy](/privacy-policy/), [honor code](/honor-code/) and [copyright dispute
policy](/copyright/). [CLS] [SEP]

for the purposes of these terms, “user” means anyone who accesses and/or
registers for our services, including without limitation students,
instructors, or other users. [CLS] [SEP] “instructor” means experts (as defined below),
tutors, and anyone who provides answers, online courses, instruction, tutoring
and learning services through our services. [CLS] [SEP]

**please be advised: these terms contain provisions that govern how claims
that you and course hero have against each other can be brought (see below). [CLS] [SEP]
these provisions will, with limited exception, require that you submit claims
you have against course hero to binding and final arbitration on an individual
basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or
representative action or proceeding.**

**will these terms ever change?**  
we are constantly trying to improve our services, so these terms may need to
change along with the services. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to change the terms at
any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice
on the [www.coursehero.com](/) website, by sending you an email and/or by some
other means. [CLS] [SEP]

if you don’t agree with the new terms, you are free to reject them;
unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] if
you use the services in any way after a change to the terms is effective, that
means you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]

except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification
of these terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and
us. [CLS] [SEP]

**what about my privacy?**  
course hero takes the privacy of its users very seriously. [CLS] [SEP] for the current
course hero privacy policy, please click [here](/privacy-policy/). [CLS] [SEP]

the children’s online privacy protection act (“coppa”) requires that online
service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect
personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from
children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to
register for the services or send any personal information about yourself to
us. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13,
we will delete that information as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that a
child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#cfbcbabfbfa0bdbb8faca0babdbcaaa7aabda0e1aca0a2). [CLS] [SEP]

######  2\. [CLS] [SEP] what are the basics of using coursehero.com (applicable to all
users)?

**registration and security**  
to use some aspects of the services, you may be required to sign up for an
account, and select a password and user name (“course hero user id”). [CLS] [SEP] if you
are accessing the services through a third party site or service (such as
“facebook” or “google”), we may require that your course hero user id be the
same as your user name for such third party site or service. [CLS] [SEP] you promise to
provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about
yourself. [CLS] [SEP] you may not select as your course hero user id a name that you don’t
have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate
that person. [CLS] [SEP] you may not transfer your account to anyone else without our
prior written permission. [CLS] [SEP] you may only create one account with us. [CLS] [SEP] if your
account has been suspended or terminated, you may not open another account
with us. [CLS] [SEP] if you access the service through a third party site or service, you
will provide your third party account credentials to us, and you are
consenting to have the information in those accounts transmitted into your
course hero account, and you agree that you shall only use accounts owned by
you, and not by any other person or entity. [CLS] [SEP]

you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract
(or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the
services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these terms on your
behalf). [CLS] [SEP] if you’re agreeing to these terms on behalf of an organization or
entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these
terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these terms, in
which case the references to “you” or “your” or the like other than in this
sentence, refer to such organization or entity. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a parent, guardian,
or other person who enables a child under the age of 13 to access the
services, you agree to stand in the shoes of such child for the purposes of
making us whole in case of damages or indemnification that could properly lie
against a child, if not for his or her age. [CLS] [SEP] the services are intended for use
by you only if you are 13 years of age or older. [CLS] [SEP]

**permitted use**

any commercial use of the services or any content (defined below) therein
(other than your own submissions (defined below), subject to the non-exclusive

licensed, not sold to you, regardless of the use of the term “purchase”
herein. [CLS] [SEP] you are prohibited from soliciting other users of the services
(hereafter “users”) to contact you outside the services, including tutors, for
any purpose. [CLS] [SEP] “content” means the materials displayed or performed or available
on or through the services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics,
data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, course materials, class notes,
flash cards, expert answers, and so forth. [CLS] [SEP] “submissions” means any content you
post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the services, whether
as a tutor or user. [CLS] [SEP]

if your use of the services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t
authorized to use the services. [CLS] [SEP] we can’t and won’t be responsible for your
using the services in a way that breaks any applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

**we are not responsible for content**  
we are not responsible for editing, modifying, filtering, screening,
monitoring, endorsing or guaranteeing any content. [CLS] [SEP] we are not liable for any
acts or omissions of users, or the accuracy or completeness of any answers or
another user’s ability to provide answers. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot ensure that any tutor or
user will complete a transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

expressly provided in this section), create derivative works based on, or
otherwise exploit any of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

you are responsible for all service, internet and/or other fees and costs

limited to, any data charges imposed by a wireless carrier or internet service
