learn more about how dribbble collects and uses data and your rights as a
dribbble user. [CLS] [SEP]

## updated october 4, 2019

### overview

dribbble holdings ltd. [CLS] [SEP] (“ **dribbble** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our**
”) is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] any
information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) who
visit the https://dribbble.com website and dribbble mobile software
application (collectively, the “ **site** ”) and use the services available
thereon (the “ **services** ”). [CLS] [SEP] amendments to this privacy policy will be
posted to the site and/or services and will be effective when posted. [CLS] [SEP] your
continued use of the site and/or services following the posting of any
amendment to this privacy policy shall constitute your acceptance of such
amendment. [CLS] [SEP]

### consent and information collection and use

when you register as a user of our site and services, we ask for personal
information that will be used to activate your account, provide the services
to you, communicate with you about the status of your account, and for other
purposes set out in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] your name, company name, address,
telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other
information about you may be required by us to provide the services or be
disclosed by you during your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] you will also be asked to
create a user name and private password, which will become part of your
account information. [CLS] [SEP]

by providing personal information to us and by retaining us to provide you
with the services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and
disclosure of such personal information as specified in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
the legal bases for our processing of personal information are primarily that
the processing is necessary for providing the services and that the processing
is carried out in our legitimate interests, which are further explained below. [CLS] [SEP]
without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we
collect, use, or disclose your personal information in specific circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

we take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access to
your personal information to fulfil their employment duties will have access
to it. [CLS] [SEP] we may use and disclose your personal or account information for the
following purposes:

  * to provide the site and services to you and to other users of the site and services;
  * to improve the quality of the site and services through polls, surveys and other similar feedback gathering activities conducted by dribbble and/or third parties;
  * to create, manage and control your account information, and to verify access rights to the site and services;
  * to bill your account;
  * to communicate with you (subject to your opt-out rights set forth in this privacy policy), including without limitation for the purpose of providing you with information about the services, or informing you of changes or additions to the services or of the availability of any other services or features we provide;
  * to assess service levels, monitor traffic patterns and gauge popularity of different features and service options of the site and/or services;
  * to enforce this privacy policy or our terms of service;
  * to protect against fraud or error, and to respond to claims of any violation of our rights or those of any third parties;
  * to respond to your requests for customer service;
  * to protect the rights, property or personal safety of you, us, our users and the public; and
  * as required to comply with applicable laws or as authorized by applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP]

for the purposes of billing your account (if you have a paid account) and in
order to process payments, dribbble utilizes third party payment gateways,
such as stripe and paypal, who will utilize your credit card and other payment
information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] dribbble
shall not be liable to you or any other person for any damages that might
result from unauthorized use, publication, disclosure or any other misuse of
such payment information, including credit card information. [CLS] [SEP]

dribbble may share your personal information with its registered api
application providers, including chrome tab extensions panda and muz.li which
deliver relevant design stories and inspiration. [CLS] [SEP] we invite you to review their
applicable data protection policies. [CLS] [SEP]

when we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take
reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this privacy policy
are complied with and these third parties provide sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures. [CLS] [SEP]

your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we
have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. [CLS] [SEP] by using
the services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside
your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than
in your country. [CLS] [SEP] while such information is outside of canada, it is subject to
the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure
to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such
other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. [CLS] [SEP] however, our practices
regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed
by this privacy policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the general
data protection regulation (“gdpr”) requirements providing adequate protection
for the transfer of personal information from the eu/eea to third country. [CLS] [SEP]

we may occasionally communicate with you regarding our products, services,
news and events. [CLS] [SEP] you have the option to not receive this information. [CLS] [SEP] we
provide an opt-out function within all email communications of this nature, or
will cease to communicate with you for this purpose if you contact us and tell
us not to communicate this information to you. [CLS] [SEP] the only kind of these
communications that you may not “opt-out” of are those required to communicate
announcements related to the services, including information specific to your
account, planned services suspensions and outages. [CLS] [SEP] we will attempt to minimize
this type of communication to you. [CLS] [SEP]

### age of consent

we do not knowingly provide the services to, and will not knowingly collect
the personal information from anyone under the age of consent. [CLS] [SEP] if you live in
a country in the eu/eea, you must be at least 16 years old to use our services
or such greater age required in your country to register for or use our
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you live in any other country except those in the eu/eea, you
must be at least 13 years old to use our services or such greater age required
in your country to register for or use our services. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to being of
the minimum required age to use our services under applicable law, if you are
not old enough to have authority to agree to our privacy policy in your
country, your parent or guardian must agree to our privacy policy on your
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any concerns about your child’s personal information,
please contact us at privacy@dribbble.com. [CLS] [SEP]

neither the site nor the services are intended for children under 13 years of
age, and no one under age 13 may provide any personal information to, on or
through the site or services. [CLS] [SEP] we do not knowingly collect personal information
from children under 13. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 13, do not use or provide any
information to, on or through the site or services, make any purchases through
the site or services, use any of the interactive or public comment features,
or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. [CLS] [SEP]
if we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child
under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
information. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe we might have any information from or about a
child under 13, please contact us at the email address provided in the
paragraph above. [CLS] [SEP]

### rights to your information

you have the right to access and edit your information at any time through the
web interface provided as part of the services. [CLS] [SEP] on written request and subject
to proof of identity, you may access the personal information that we hold,
used or communicated and ask that any necessary corrections be made, where
applicable, as authorized or required by law. [CLS] [SEP] however, to make sure that the
personal information we maintain about you is accurate and up to date, please
inform us immediately of any change in your personal information by mail or
e-mail. [CLS] [SEP]

under the gdpr, you may be entitled to additional rights, including: (i) the
right to withdraw consent to processing where consent is the basis of
processing; (ii) the right to access your personal information and certain
other supplementary information, under certain conditions; (iii) the right to
object to unlawful data processing, under certain conditions; (iv) the right

personal information concerning you that you provided us in a structured,
commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions; (vii)

certain conditions; (viii) the right to lodge a complaint with data protection
authorities. [CLS] [SEP] if you want to learn more about your rights under the gdpr, you
