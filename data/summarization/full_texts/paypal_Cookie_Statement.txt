when you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or
messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, web
beacons, and other similar technologies for storing information to help
provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience and for advertising
purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

this page is designed to help you understand more about these technologies and
our use of them on our sites and in our services, applications, and tools. [CLS] [SEP]
below is a summary of a few key things you should know about our use of such
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] you can review the contents of our full user cookie notice
below. [CLS] [SEP]

our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. [CLS] [SEP] they are either
necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our
performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant
and targeted ads. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on
your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies
and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period
(persistent).you are free to block, delete, or disable these cookies if your
device permits so. [CLS] [SEP] you can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in
your browser or device settings. [CLS] [SEP]

where possible, security measures are set in place to prevent unauthorized
access to our cookies and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] a unique identifier ensures
that only we and/or our authorized service providers have access to cookie
data. [CLS] [SEP]

service providers are companies that help us with various aspects of our
business, such as site operations, services, applications, advertisements and
tools. [CLS] [SEP] we use some authorized service providers to help us to serve you
relevant ads on our services and other places on the internet. [CLS] [SEP] these service
providers may also place cookies on your device via our services (third party
cookies). [CLS] [SEP] they may also collect information that helps them identify your
device, such as ip-address or other unique or device identifiers. [CLS] [SEP]

### **what are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?**

like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files
placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to
collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of
information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services,
applications, messaging, and tools. [CLS] [SEP]

the specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar
technologies we use may change from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] in order to help you better
understand this policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the
following limited terminology and definitions:

**cookies** – small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers)
placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or
view a message. [CLS] [SEP] cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or
browser. [CLS] [SEP] there are several types of cookies:

  * session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session. [CLS] [SEP]
  * persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * first-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting. [CLS] [SEP]
  * third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting. [CLS] [SEP]

cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most
commercial browsers. [CLS] [SEP] the preferences for each browser you use will need to be
set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and
options. [CLS] [SEP]

**web beacons** – small graphic images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear
gifs”) that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging,
and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our
users and user behavior. [CLS] [SEP]

**similar technologies** – technologies that store information in your browser
or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash
cookies, html 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. [CLS] [SEP] these
technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances
may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly
through your installed applications or device. [CLS] [SEP] we do not use these
technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off
our sites. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use the terms “cookies” or “similar technologies” interchangeably in
our policies to refer to all technologies that we may use to store data in
your browser or device or that collect information or help us identify you in
the manner described above. [CLS] [SEP]

**why we use cookies**  
our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. [CLS] [SEP] they are either
necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our
performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant
and targeted ads. [CLS] [SEP] we use both session and persistent cookies and similar
technologies. [CLS] [SEP]

  
generally, these technologies allow our sites, services, applications, and
tools to store relevant information in your browser or device and later read
that information in order to identify your device to our servers or internal
systems. [CLS] [SEP] where applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar
technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service
providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is
designed for interpretation only by us. [CLS] [SEP]

  
our uses of such technologies fall into the following general categories:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] **essential**. [CLS] [SEP] we may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our sites, services, applications, and tools. [CLS] [SEP] this includes technologies that allow you access to our sites, services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] **performance related**. [CLS] [SEP] we may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our websites, applications, services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our websites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services, or tools;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] **functionality related**. [CLS] [SEP] we may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our sites, services, applications, or tools. [CLS] [SEP] this may include identifying you when you sign into our sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our sites;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] **advertising or targeting related**. [CLS] [SEP] we may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on third party sites. [CLS] [SEP] this includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that have been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement. [CLS] [SEP]

**_any personal information that we collect and store through use of these
technologies for categories 2 through 4 above are based on your consent,
obtained through a conspicuous disclosure on our website during your first
visit. [CLS] [SEP] you can withdraw this consent through your browser settings as
explained below._**

### **use of these technologies by authorized third-party service providers**

we may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers,
who are authorized to place third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar
technologies for storing information on our sites or in our services,
applications, and tools with our permission. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers help us
to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience. [CLS] [SEP]

these service providers may use these technologies to help us deliver our own
content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. [CLS] [SEP] we
do not permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal
information on our sites or in our services, applications, or tools for their
own purposes. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers are subject to confidentiality
agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of
any personal information. [CLS] [SEP] third party cookies are covered by the third-
parties’ privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

with the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or
other authorized third-parties, we do not permit any third-party content on
sites (such as item listings, member-to-member communications, classified
listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilize any cookies, web
beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to
collect your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe a listing or other third-
party content might be collecting personal information or using tracking
technologies on one of our sites, please report it to
[spoof@paypal.com](mailto:spoof@paypal.com). [CLS] [SEP]

### **ad networks and exchanges operated by authorized third parties for
interest-based advertising**

we may use third parties, such as advertising networks and exchanges, to allow
us to serve you advertisements. [CLS] [SEP] these third-party ad networks and exchange
providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to
collect information about your visit to our site and elsewhere on the
internet. [CLS] [SEP] they may also collect your device identifier, ip address, or
identifier for advertising (idfa). [CLS] [SEP] the information that these third parties
collect may be used to provide you with more relevant advertising on our sites
or elsewhere on the web. [CLS] [SEP] third party cookies are covered by the third-parties’
privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

based advertising, and how to opt-out of that practice by companies

### **“do not track”**

california law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser do
not track (dnt) signals. [CLS] [SEP] because there currently isn't an industry or legal
standard for recognizing or honoring dnt signals, we don't respond to them at
this time. [CLS] [SEP] we await the result of work by the privacy community and industry
to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. [CLS] [SEP]
