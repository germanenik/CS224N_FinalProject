##### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] mobile terms

the following additional terms are applicable to our mobile apps:

**fantexts and other sms messages**

**if you are a member of fantexts, you may receive fantexts and other
promotional texts to your mobile phone using automated technology. [CLS] [SEP] you can
unsubscribe at any time by texting 'stop' to 36346 (fndgo). [CLS] [SEP] if you have any

name and the date, time and content of your messages. [CLS] [SEP] we may use this
information to contact you and to provide the services you request from us and

**fandango mobile tickets**

rather than bringing a print-at-home bar-coded ticket or confirmation number
to the theater, some of fandango's exhibitor partners give you the option of
having your ticket delivered to your mobile device as a picture message (a
"mobile ticket"). [CLS] [SEP] the mobile ticket contains a unique barcode and some
accompanying text with details of the movie you are going to see. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
questions about the purchase or use of the mobile ticket, please see the
[fandango mobile ticket delivery faq](/policies/mobileterms). [CLS] [SEP] please note that
mobile tickets are not available for movietickets.com mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP]

your purchase of a mobile ticket will be deemed your agreement to the
following terms:

  * message and data rates may apply and, if so, are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the mobile ticket is in the form of a unique barcode sent as a text message to your mobile device or delivered on the confirmation page from the fandango movies - times & tickets mobile app. [CLS] [SEP] the barcode and any accompanying text sent to you by fandango is the entire ticket, and not the barcode in isolation from the accompanying text. [CLS] [SEP] accompanying text includes any text stating the originating source of the barcode. [CLS] [SEP] any barcode with non-original text is invalid. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the mobile ticket barcode cannot be forwarded to anyone else. [CLS] [SEP] doing so invalidates your mobile ticket without the right to a refund. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you purchase multiple tickets in a single order, your mobile ticket holds all of those tickets, and all of your guests must arrive at the same time to gain entry using your mobile ticket. [CLS] [SEP]
  * fandango is not responsible for lost or stolen mobile tickets, except as required by law. [CLS] [SEP] anyone attempting to gain entry with a mobile ticket reported lost or stolen, or cancelled for any other reason, may be reported to the authorities and may have their mobile device withheld as evidence. [CLS] [SEP]
  * fandango shall have the right to void any mobile tickets that violate these policies. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] copyrights

fandango respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to
do the same. [CLS] [SEP] the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 (the "act") provides
recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the
internet infringes their rights under u.s. [CLS] [SEP] copyright law. [CLS] [SEP] fandango, pursuant
to the act, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your
license to use the services if it determines in its sole and absolute
discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged
acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material
or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, in
compliance with the act, if you believe that any such third party materials
infringe your intellectual property rights, please send a notice to the agent
identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement. [CLS] [SEP] the notice
must include the following information (a) a physical or electronic signature
of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work
claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on
the services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of
such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be
infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably
sufficient to allow fandango to locate the material on the services; (d) the
name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the
complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith
belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized
by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the
information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe in good faith that
a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the
dmca permits you to send fandango a counter-notice. [CLS] [SEP] notices and counter-
notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the dmca;
see <http://www.loc.gov/copyright> for details. [CLS] [SEP] notices and counter-notices
with respect to the services should be sent to:

> dmca agent  
>  nbcuniversal law department  
>  30 rockefeller plaza, rm. [CLS] [SEP] 1087e  
>  new york, new york 10112  
>  (212) 664-4444  
>  by email: [dmca.agent@nbcuni.com](mailto:dmca.agent@nbcuni.com)

fandango suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice
or counter-notice. [CLS] [SEP] also, please be aware that there can be penalties for false
claims under the dmca. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] children's online privacy protection act notification

the services and the site is not designed or intended for use by children
under 13, and thus all users must be at least 13. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 18, you
should use fandango only with involvement and permission of a parent or
guardian. [CLS] [SEP] some of our services or portions of the site, including movies
anywhere-enabled features, may require you to be over the age of 18 or the age
of majority for your state; please see the terms and conditions of the
relevant offer for more details. [CLS] [SEP]

pursuant to 47 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] section 230(d) as amended, fandango hereby notifies you
that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or
filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting
access to material that is harmful to minors. [CLS] [SEP] information identifying current
providers of such protections is available at the electronic frontier
foundation web site, <http://www.eff.org>. [CLS] [SEP] to view information on our policy
regarding the privacy of children under the age of 13, please see our [privacy
policy](/policies/privacy-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

##### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] disclaimer of warranties

while fandango uses reasonable efforts to include up to date information on
the site and other services, fandango makes no warranties or representations
as to its accuracy, timeliness, reliability, completeness or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

fandango provides the site and other service on an "as is" and "as available"
basis. [CLS] [SEP] fandango, its affiliates, agents and licensors (collectively, the
"fandango parties") disclaim all warranties and conditions, statutory or
otherwise, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. [CLS] [SEP] without
limiting the foregoing, fandango does not warrant that the site or other
service will (1) be uninterrupted; (2) be free from inaccuracies, errors,
viruses or other harmful components; (3) meet your requirements; or (4)
operate in the configuration or with the hardware or software you use. [CLS] [SEP] your
use of the site and service is solely at your risk. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 13\. [CLS] [SEP] exclusion of damages

none of the fandango parties will be liable to you or any third party for any
direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages
(including damages relating to lost profits, lost data or loss of goodwill) or
any damages whatsoever that result from your use of or inability to use the
site or other service. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation applies whether the alleged liability
is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal
theory, and even if fandango has been advised of the possibility of such
damage. [CLS] [SEP] this waiver applies, without limitation, to any damages or injury
arising from any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption,
deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, file
corruption, communication-line failure, network or system outage, or theft,
destruction, unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of any record. [CLS] [SEP] you
specifically acknowledge and agree that each of the fandango parties shall not
be liable for any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of any user of the
site or other service. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, fandango will not be
liable for any loss or damage arising out of (1) your failure to comply with
paragraph 3 (registration, accounts and passwords) or (2) content posted to
the site or other service by you or any third party. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 14\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

in no event will the fandango parties' aggregate liability to you in
connection with the site and service or these terms exceed the amount (if any)
paid by you to fandango in the six months immediately preceding the event
which gave rise to the liability. [CLS] [SEP] fandango shall not be responsible for, or
have any liability for, any actions, omissions, occurrences, injuries or
damages that occur on or near any theater or other location, or in connection
with any service or product, ticketed or made available through fandango’s
services or sites; you will look solely to the operators and providers of such
theaters, locations, services and products with respect to any such liability
(if any). [CLS] [SEP]

##### 15\. [CLS] [SEP] applicability of disclaimers, exclusions and limits

because some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion of damages,
fandango's liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the greatest
extent permitted by the law of such jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, because some
jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, the
disclaimers set forth above may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 16\. [CLS] [SEP] third party web sites and functionalities

the third-party web sites or services linked to or from the services are not
controlled by fandango. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, third parties may provide tools or
services ("third party tools") that are made available to you through our
services (for example, but not limited to, facebook features). [CLS] [SEP] accordingly,
fandango makes no warranties or conditions regarding such third-party services
or web sites or third party tools and will not be liable for any loss or
damage caused by your use of or reliance on such third services or web sites
or third party tools. [CLS] [SEP] your use of third-party services or web sites or third
party tools is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] the inclusion on the service of a link to a
third-party service or web site, or inclusion of a third party tool, does not
imply an endorsement by fandango. [CLS] [SEP] when you access any of these third-party
services or sites, or third party tools, your rights and obligations will be
governed by the agreements and policies relating to the use of those third
party web sites or services or third party tools. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 17\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification

you will indemnify and hold harmless the fandango parties, and at fandango's
option defend the fandango parties, from and against any damage, loss, cost or
expense (including without limitation, legal fees and costs) incurred in
connection with any third-party claim, demand, proceeding or action ("claim")
brought against any of the fandango parties arising out of your use of the
services or any alleged breach by you of any provision of these terms, or the
infringement by you, or any other subscriber or user of your account, of any
intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
obligated to indemnify any of the fandango parties, fandango may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, control the defense and disposition (including its
possible settlement) of any claim at your sole cost and expense. [CLS] [SEP] without
limitation of the foregoing, you will not settle, compromise or in any other
manner dispose of any claim without the written consent of fandango. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 18\. [CLS] [SEP] termination

in its sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you, fandango
may suspend or terminate your use of and access to the services, terminate
your account and/or remove and discard anything transmitted by you, or
information stored, sent, or received via the services without prior notice
and for any reason, including, but not limited to: (i) concurrent access of
the services with identical user identification, (ii) permitting another
person or entity to use your user identification to access the services, (iii)
any unauthorized access or use of the services, (iv) any violation of these
terms, (v) tampering with or alteration of any of the software and/or data
files contained in, or accessed through, the services, (vi) failure to use the
services on a regular basis, or (vii) abuse, deception or fraudulent behavior. [CLS] [SEP]
such suspension or termination may include, but not be limited to, suspension
or termination of access or rights to receive any content. [CLS] [SEP] you may terminate
your account for any reason by emailing fandango at
[unsubscribe@fandango.com](mailto:unsubscribe@fandango.com). [CLS] [SEP] fandango shall
not be liable to you or any third party for any claims or damages arising out
of any termination or suspension of the services. [CLS] [SEP] termination, suspension, or
cancellation of the services or your access rights shall not affect any right
or relief to which fandango may be entitled, at law or in equity, and all
rights granted to you will automatically terminate and immediately revert to
fandango. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 19\. [CLS] [SEP] general

these terms and the relationship between you and fandango shall be governed by
the laws of the united states and the state of new york without regard to its
conflict of law provisions. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the arbitration provisions above, and
other than small claims actions as permitted therein, any action or proceeding
arising from, relating to or in connection with these terms will be brought
exclusively in the federal or state courts located in new york, new york, and
you irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and agree
that it is a convenient forum and that you will not seek to transfer such
action or proceeding to any other forum or jurisdiction, under the doctrine of
_forum nonconveniens_ or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] licensors of the fandango services are
third party beneficiaries to these terms. [CLS] [SEP] no failure or delay by fandango in
exercising any right, power or privilege under these terms will operate as a
waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power, or privilege under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise
expressly provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of these terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision, all of which will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
regardless of any statute or law which establishes a different statute of
limitations, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any claim
or cause of action (including any arbitration) arising out of, related to or
connected with the use of the services, or these terms, our [privacy
policy](/policies/privacy-policy), our [terms and policies](/policies/terms-
and-policies), or other fandango transactions or relationships must be filed
within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
barred. [CLS] [SEP] the paragraph or section titles in these terms are for convenience
only and have no legal or contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP] these terms represent the entire
understanding of the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between the parties
regarding its subject matter, and may not be amended, altered or waived except
in writing by the party to be charged. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are binding upon and shall
ensure to the benefit of parties and their respective successors, heirs,
executor, administrators, personal representatives and permitted assigns. [CLS] [SEP] you
shall not assign your rights or obligations hereunder without fandango's prior
written consent. [CLS] [SEP]

##### 20\. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration

**binding arbitration of all disputes**

**we believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive
way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP]
therefore, pursuant to these terms, if you have any dispute or disagreement
with us regarding or relating to (i) your use of or interaction with the
services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with
fandango, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to fandango or that
fandango may gather in connection with such use, interaction or
transaction(collectively, "fandango transactions or relationships"), you will
not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim
and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or
similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] by using or interacting with
the services, or engaging in any other fandango transactions or relationships
with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below. [CLS] [SEP] our rights and
obligations under this arbitration provision shall inure to the benefit of
each of fandango's owners (as defined in the privacy policy regardless of
whether any of them are named as aco-defendant with us or named individually
in a claim that would otherwise be subject to this arbitration provision if
brought against us.**

we will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints,
disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP] if those efforts fail,
by using our services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement
you may have against fandango, and any claim that fandango may have against
you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with our [terms of
use](/termsofuse), our privacy policy, our [terms
andpolicies](/policies/terms-and-policies), or any fandango transactions or
relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration
("arbitration") administered by jams or its successor ("jams") and conducted
in accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules and procedures in
effect at the time the arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in
controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the jams comprehensive
arbitration rules and procedures then in effect (respectively, the "applicable
rules"). [CLS] [SEP] the applicable rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. [CLS] [SEP] if jams is no
longer in existence, the arbitration shall be administered by the american
arbitration association or its successor (the "aaa") instead, and conducted in
accordance with the aaa commercial arbitration rules in effect at that time
(which shall be the "applicable rules" in such circumstances). [CLS] [SEP] if jams (or, if
applicable, aaa) at the time the arbitration is filed has minimum standards of
procedural fairness for consumer arbitrations in effect which would be
applicable to the matter in dispute, fandango agrees to provide the benefit of
such minimum standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the
comparable arbitration provisions set forth herein, provided, however, that in
no event may such minimum standards contravene or restrict the application of
subpart (e) or (i) below. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, nothing herein shall prevent any party
from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of
appropriate jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree that:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the applicable rules or by mutual agreement between you and fandango (the "arbitrator");
  2. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these terms and/or these arbitration provisions hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms is void or voidable;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by jams (or, if applicable, aaa) pursuant to the applicable rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and fandango; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission. [CLS] [SEP]
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the state of new york consistent with the federal arbitration act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the united states, irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii)shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with new york or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
  5. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration can resolve only your and/or fandango's individual claims, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
  6. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "award"). [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
  7. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, fandango will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
  8. [CLS] [SEP] in the event you recover an award greater than fandango's last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the award fandango's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the arbitration, but fandango shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees; and
  9. [CLS] [SEP] with the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the applicable rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. [CLS] [SEP] if, however, subpart (e)is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor fandango shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]
  10. [CLS] [SEP] fandango may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty(30) days after fandango has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from fandango transactions and relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification. [CLS] [SEP]
  11. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against fandango in your local small claims court within the united states, if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]
