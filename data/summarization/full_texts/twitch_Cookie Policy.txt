#### account closure & deletion

if you would like to close your account and delete your profile information on
[www.twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) go to

the twitch services may link to third-party websites or services. [CLS] [SEP] the privacy
practices of those third parties are not governed by this privacy notice. [CLS] [SEP] we
encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and
services to understand their practices. [CLS] [SEP]

if you connect to a third-party service (such as facebook, twitter, or another
third-party application) through the twitch services or otherwise link your
twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing
us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your
username, the fact that your connection originated from the twitch services,
and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on
the twitch services to such third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may make
information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers
to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game
items. [CLS] [SEP]

#### extensions

the [twitch extensions](https://dev.twitch.tv/extensions) program allows
broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and
applications on their channel pages. [CLS] [SEP] you can find out more about the specific
extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links
or icons that twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on
the twitch video player or at the bottom of an extensionâs panel. [CLS] [SEP]

interaction by a viewer with an extension or with the channel on which the
extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the extension
with viewer information of the nature described above in âautomatically
collected information.â twitch does not provide access to your user name or
id to third-party extension developers as part of the twitch extensions
program unless you click âgrant accessâ within the extension or you
install an extension on your channel. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for any information
you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on
the extension or visiting that developerâs website. [CLS] [SEP]

we require extension developers to process data about you only for the
purposes set forth in our [developer
agreement](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/developer-agreement/). [CLS] [SEP] we encourage
you to visit an extensionâs detail page to review any privacy policy posted
by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy
practices. [CLS] [SEP]

#### advertisers and analytics providers

twitch may use third-party web analytics services in connection with the
twitch services. [CLS] [SEP] these service providers use a variety of tracking
technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the twitch services. [CLS] [SEP] the
information collected (described above in âautomatically collected
informationâ) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and
processed to evaluate your use of the twitch services. [CLS] [SEP]

twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and
advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads
to you both on and off the twitch services. [CLS] [SEP] we may share with these third
parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad
identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to
understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads). [CLS] [SEP]
twitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off twitchâs
services. [CLS] [SEP] when we do so, we may share information such as your email address
or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to âmatchâ to
other information that may have about you. [CLS] [SEP]

advertisers on twitch, or representatives or service providers working on
their behalf (âtwitch advertisersâ), sometimes use technology to serve ads
that appear on our services directly to your device.â they automatically
receive certain data, such as your ip address, when this happens. [CLS] [SEP] they may
also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of
their ads and to personalize ad content. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy notice does not apply
to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of twitch
advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] for more
information about twitch advertisers and similar entities that use these
technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our
[privacy choices](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-choices/) page. [CLS] [SEP]

#### do not track

do not track (âdntâ) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain
web browsers. [CLS] [SEP] dnt is a way for users to inform websites and services that they
do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time
and across websites or online services. [CLS] [SEP] we are committed to providing you with
meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-
party purposes, and that is why we provide the network advertising initiative,
your online choices and the digital advertising alliance opt-out links above. [CLS] [SEP]
however, twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated dnt
signals. [CLS] [SEP]

#### data security

twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to
protect the integrity and security of your information. [CLS] [SEP] these measures may
vary based on the sensitivity of your information. [CLS] [SEP] however, no security
precautions or systems can be completely secure. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to twitch, and you do so at your
own risk. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,
or managerial safeguards. [CLS] [SEP]

#### retention of your information

twitch maintains data related to your usage of twitch for as long as it is
required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this privacy
notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and
accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you. [CLS] [SEP] once you have asked
us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete
all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law. [CLS] [SEP]

personal information is based on consent, twitch will not knowingly engage in
that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable
data protection law. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn that we are engaged in that processing with
such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to
promptly remove applicable information from our records. [CLS] [SEP]

#### merger or sale

in the event that twitch, or some or all assets related to the twitch services
are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a
contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of
these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have
collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other
change of control event, including in the course of diligence. [CLS] [SEP]

#### international data transfers

the united states (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other

privacy notice and applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
