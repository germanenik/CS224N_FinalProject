 ** _you can see our previous privacy policy_**[ **
_here_**](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234) ** _._**

this privacy policy explains how a medium corporation ( _“_ ** _medium_** _,”_
_“_ ** _we_** _,”_ or _“_ ** _us_** _”_ ) collects, uses, and discloses
information about you. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy applies when you use our websites,
mobile applications, and other online products and services that link to this
privacy policy (collectively, our _“_ ** _services_** ”), contact our customer
service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. [CLS] [SEP]

we may change this privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if we make changes, we
will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in some
cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement
to our website or providing you with a notification). [CLS] [SEP] we encourage you to
review this privacy policy regularly to stay informed about our information
practices and the choices available to you. [CLS] [SEP]

# collection of information

## information you provide to us

we collect information you provide directly to us. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you share
information directly with us when you create an account, fill out a form,
submit or post content through our services, purchase a membership,
communicate with us via third-party platforms, request customer support, or
otherwise communicate with us. [CLS] [SEP] the types of personal information we may
collect include your name, display name, username, bio, email address,
business information, your content, including your avatar image, photos,
posts, responses, and series published by you, and any other information you
choose to provide. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such
as when you purchase a medium membership as a gift for someone. [CLS] [SEP] we will use
this information to fulfill your request and will not send communications to
your contacts unrelated to your request, unless they separately consent to
receive communications from us or otherwise engage with us. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not collect payment information through our services. [CLS] [SEP] we rely on third
parties to process payments in connection with our services. [CLS] [SEP] any information
you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the third-party payment
processor’s privacy policy, and we encourage you to review this policy before
you provide any information to the payment processor. [CLS] [SEP]

## information we collect automatically when you interact with us

in some instances, we automatically collect certain information, including:

  *  **activity information:** we collect information about your activity on our services, such as your reading history and when you share links, follow users, highlight posts, and clap for posts. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **transactional information:** when you purchase a membership, we collect information about the transaction, such as subscription details, purchase price, and the date of the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **device and usage information:** we collect information about how you access our services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, ip address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information about your activity on our services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our services. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies:** we use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you. [CLS] [SEP] cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our services and your experience, see which areas and features of our services are popular, and count visits. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear gifs”) are electronic images that we use on our services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage. [CLS] [SEP] we also work with third party analytics providers who use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our services and other websites and applications, including your ip address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, and links clicked. [CLS] [SEP] this information may be used by medium and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver content targeted to your interests on our services, and better understand your online activity. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about cookies and how to disable them, see your choices below. [CLS] [SEP]

## information we collect from other sources

we obtain information from third-party sources. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may collect
information about you from social networks, accounting services providers and
data analytics providers. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, if you create or log into your medium
account through a third-party platform (such as apple, facebook, google, or
twitter), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such
as your name, lists of friends or followers, birthday, and profile picture, in
accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform. [CLS] [SEP]

## information we derive

we may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the
information we collect. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may make inferences about your
location based on your ip address or infer reading preferences based on your
reading history. [CLS] [SEP]

# use of information

we use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our
services, which includes publishing and distributing user-generated content,
personalizing the posts you see and operating our metered paywall. [CLS] [SEP] we also use
the information we collect to:

  * create and maintain your medium account;
  * process transactions and send related information, such as confirmations, receipts, and user experience surveys;
  * send you technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
  * respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;
  * communicate with you about new content, products, services, and features offered by medium and provide other news and information we think will interest you (see your choices below for information about how to opt out of these communications at any time);
  * monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services;
  * detect, investigate, and prevent security incidents and other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity and protect the rights and property of medium and others;
  * debug to identify and repair errors in our services;
  * comply with our legal and financial obligations; and
  * carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected. [CLS] [SEP]

# sharing of information

we share personal information in the following circumstances or as otherwise
described in this policy:

  * we share personal information with other users of the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you use our services to publish content, post comments or send private notes, certain information about you will be visible to others, such as your name, photo, bio, other account information you may provide, and information about your activities on our services (e.g., your followers and who you follow, recent posts, claps, highlights, and responses). [CLS] [SEP]
  * we share personal information with vendors, service providers, and consultants that need access to personal information in order to perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service, communications, and marketing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. [CLS] [SEP] if we are going to disclose your personal information in response to legal process, we will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. [CLS] [SEP] we will object to legal requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may share personal information if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of medium, our users, the public, or others. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we share personal information with our lawyers and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may share personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. [CLS] [SEP]
  * personal information is shared between and among medium and our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we share personal information with your consent or at your direction. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. [CLS] [SEP]

# third-party embeds

medium does not host some of the content displayed on our services. [CLS] [SEP] users have
the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third party, but is
embedded in our pages (an _“_ ** _embed_** _”_ ). [CLS] [SEP] when you interact with an
embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third
party just as if you were visiting the third party’s site directly. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, when you load a medium post page with a youtube video embed and watch
the video, youtube receives information about your activity, such as your ip
address and how much of the video you watch. [CLS] [SEP] medium does not control what
information third parties collect through embeds or what they do with the
information. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy does not apply to information collected
through embeds. [CLS] [SEP] the privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the
embed applies to any information the embed collects, and we recommend you
review that policy before interacting with the embed. [CLS] [SEP]

# transfer of information to the united states and other countries

medium is headquartered in the united states, and we have operations and
service providers in the united states and other countries. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, we and
our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or
access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection
that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we
transfer personal data to amazon web services, one of our service providers
that processes personal information for us in various data center locations
across the globe, including those listed [here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-
aws/global-infrastructure/). [CLS] [SEP] we will take steps to ensure that your personal
information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in
which we process it. [CLS] [SEP]

# your choices

## account information

you may access, correct, delete and export your account information at any
time by logging into the services and navigating to the[ settings
page](https://medium.com/me/settings). [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you choose to
delete your account, we may continue to retain certain information about you
as required by law or for our legitimate business purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

## cookies

most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. [CLS] [SEP] if you prefer, you can
usually adjust your browser settings to remove or reject browser cookies. [CLS] [SEP]
please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability
and functionality of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

## communications preferences

you may opt out of receiving certain communications from us, such as digests,
newsletters, and activity notifications, by following the instructions in
those communications or through your account’s [settings
page](https://medium.com/me/settings). [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out, we may still send you
administrative emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing
business relations. [CLS] [SEP]

## mobile push notifications

with your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you
can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification
settings on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]

# your california privacy rights

1798.100 et seq.) affords consumers residing in california certain rights with

section applies to you. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
in the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of

electronic network activity information, and inferences. [CLS] [SEP] for details about the
precise data points we collect and the categories of sources of such
collection, please see the collection of information section above. [CLS] [SEP] we collect

against you if you exercise your rights under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
if we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence
that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent
otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on
your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] this may include requiring you to verify your identity. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please [contact
us](mailto:privacy@medium.com). [CLS] [SEP]
