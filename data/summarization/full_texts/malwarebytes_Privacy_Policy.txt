last updated: february 9, 2021

we believe you have the right to a malware-free existence. [CLS] [SEP] we also believe
just as strongly that you have the right to privacy and control over your
information. [CLS] [SEP] this fundamental belief shapes our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

we will be clear about the data we collect and why. [CLS] [SEP] we do not and will not
sell your data to third parties. [CLS] [SEP] our primary purpose in collecting your data
is to be able to equip you with effective products and services that provide a
more agile, dynamic response to new and unknown threats. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy applies to malwarebytes websites and products and
describes how malwarebytes collects, uses, shares and secures your personal
information. [CLS] [SEP] it also describes your choices regarding use, access and
correction of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

please, if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact us
at [privacy@malwarebytes.com](mailto:privacy@malwarebytes.com). [CLS] [SEP]

caution: legalese ahead. [CLS] [SEP]

### when do we collect your information?

we may collect your information: (1) when you license and use our software
("software collection"); (2) when you interact with certain portions of our
website, such as our forums, blogs, and support center ("website collection");
(3) when you communicate with us by email, chat, or otherwise ("dialogue
collection"); and (4) when you apply to work for us (“job applicant
collection”)

### simply

we collect your information when you use our software, website, or otherwise
communicate with us. [CLS] [SEP]

### what information do we collect?

we may collect both personal information and non-personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
personal information is information that is either expressly provided by you,
such as your name, or information that can be used either alone or in
combination with other information to personally identify you, such as your
email address, phone number, and user name. [CLS] [SEP]

we may collect the following personal information from you: contact
information (such as name, email address, mailing address, or phone number);
unique identifiers (such as username and password used for authenticating your
malwarebytes accounts and products) and machine identification number;
information about your business (such as company name, company size, business
type) and; information related to your usage of our products as described in
the next section, below. [CLS] [SEP]

our service providers may collect billing information (credit card number and
billing address) on our behalf to process orders. [CLS] [SEP]

non-personal information is all information that is not personal information
or is information that was personal information but which we modify and/or
aggregate with other data in order to make it non-personal information. [CLS] [SEP] as is
true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. [CLS] [SEP] this
information may include internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type,
internet service provider (isp), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our
site (e.g., html pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp,
and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate, and anonymously
generated device identifiers and administer the site. [CLS] [SEP]

### simply

there are two types of information we collect: personal and non-personal. [CLS] [SEP]

### software collection – information collected when using our security
software

### user-agent string

each api communication coming from any of our client software identifies
itself with a string that includes information about the software itself:

  * the program and build which is sending the request
  * the current license state (as identified by the product)
  * the version of the software as well as any subcomponents (currently, databases) that it uses

### why?

so we can manage your malwarebytes product and ensure that it is up to date. [CLS] [SEP]

### geoip data

when we collect data from our client systems, we do not store ip address from
which the request originates. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do use it to gather geographic
information on the system calling in:

  * a location item indicating the continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude of the user based on your ip address
  * the type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile)
  * the isp through which the connection is made 
  * the organization to which the ip address is licensed, if any

### why?

so our malware intelligence team can track malware and potentially unwanted
program ("pup") outbreaks and patterns. [CLS] [SEP]

### functional data

we collect data that is necessary for the functionality of the software or for
our performance of providing the software to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may need to
collect system processes and behaviors in order to perform system rollback and
recovery operations. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so our products are able to function as intended, including being able to
detect and remediate malware and pups, and provide rollback and recovery
operations. [CLS] [SEP]

### client data

in addition to functional data, we collect client data from each program that
describe the client environment (i.e., our software and the computer system it
is running on). [CLS] [SEP] in this, we collect:

  * the operating system the program is installed on 
  * the system language in use on that system 
  * the processor architecture (i.e., 32- or 64-bit)
  * the file system in use (i.e., fat32)
  * information from the windows security/action center, including security settings and programs installed or in use
  * information about other malwarebytes program settings and how they are configured
  * information about how you use our software or services ("log data") including use of integrations with our products

### why?

so we can gather performance data around our products and how they operate in
relation to different hardware and software environments. [CLS] [SEP] by having this data,
we can improve our products as well as optimize them for the various system
configurations that our users are using. [CLS] [SEP]

### machine identification data

we identify each system by assigning each system with a malwarebytes-generated
distinct identifier that is created at install time. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so we are able to get an accurate count of our install base. [CLS] [SEP] we are also able
to identify changes to an individual system over time, allowing us to
recognize trends which are used for improving our products. [CLS] [SEP]

### license data

we collect data from products corresponding to the products' applicable
license state. [CLS] [SEP] these data also use a unique identifier. [CLS] [SEP] in this, we collect:

  * the key or keys used to license the current product 
  * the type of license being used 
  * if it represents a console system, the number of seats being managed by that installation of the console
  * endpoint and network domain information

### why?

so we can remind you when your malwarebytes subscription is about to expire or
to determine the correct license type. [CLS] [SEP] we may use such license data in
conjunction with other software collection to assist you in resolving
licensing issues. [CLS] [SEP]

### malware and pup data

we collect data about the malware and pups that are detected by our products. [CLS] [SEP]
we collect:

  * the vendor name of the malware or pup removed 
  * an encrypted description of which database rule was used to remove the malware or pup in question
  * artifacts detected as malware, pups, or suspicious files
  * information related to detected artifacts

### why?

so our malware intelligence team can track malware and pup outbreaks and
improve the efficacy of malwarebytes products. [CLS] [SEP]

### trial data

when a client attempts to start a trial, we track it remotely in order to
validate that the trial is allowed. [CLS] [SEP] for this information we use another unique
system identifier. [CLS] [SEP] we collect:

  * the client's request for a trial 
  * the start date and duration of the trial provided 
  * any attempted conversion/purchase generated by clicking an in-app link, so that it can be correlated with a trial

### why?

so we can update your malwarebytes products accurately and when they need it. [CLS] [SEP]

### exploit data

in malwarebytes anti-exploit products we collect a complex data object for any
exploit process which is blocked by the software. [CLS] [SEP] in this data we collect:

  * process id of the exploit process 
  * file path of exploit process 
  * md5 hash of the exploit payload, if any
  * command-line arguments passed to the exploit
  * a list of urls potentially associated with the exploit, including redirect jumps if any 
  * exploit payload files 
  * exploit file-format (doc, pdf, xls, etc…)
  * (potentially) a copy of the exploit executable itself

### why?

so our malware intelligence team can track exploit outbreaks and deepen its
understanding of new exploit techniques. [CLS] [SEP]

### operating system user account name and domain

in certain malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack
protection, we collect user account names and domain information. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so that you (as the customer) can see what credentials are being targeted
during brute-force attacks. [CLS] [SEP]

### remote desktop protocol (rdp) port number(s) used for incoming
connections. [CLS] [SEP]

in certain malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack
protection, we collect user account names and domain information. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so that you (as the customer) can see what ports are being used for rdp
connections, and improve our products. [CLS] [SEP]

### mobile application data

when you download and use our services, we automatically collect information
on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the unique device
identifier. [CLS] [SEP]

we send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about
any events or promotions that we may be running. [CLS] [SEP] if you no longer wish to
receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device
level. [CLS] [SEP] to ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect
certain information about your device such as operating system and user
identification information. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your
mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile apps or
services. [CLS] [SEP]

we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the
functionality of our mobile software on your phone. [CLS] [SEP] this software may record
information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur
within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the
application was downloaded from. [CLS] [SEP] we do not link the information we store
within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within
the mobile application. [CLS] [SEP]

as part of our text message filtering functionality, our mobile software also
collects text messages from senders who are not in your contacts, and analyzes
these text messages to determine whether they are malicious. [CLS] [SEP] we only receive
the sender information and the body of the message which is analyzed to
determine if they contain malicious urls or come from malicious senders; no
information is provided about the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] text messages that are malicious
are retained for analysis by our researchers, however, all other text messages
are discarded. [CLS] [SEP]

### simply

we collect information that allows us to fight against malware and pups on
your device and contact you if you allow us to send push notifications. [CLS] [SEP]

### software collection – information collected when using our malwarebytes
privacy software

### license data

as part of installation and activation of your malwarebytes privacy
application, we:

  * collect the key used to license the product; and
  * generate a unique identifier. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so that we can activate your license, validate your account, and assist you in
resolving licensing issues. [CLS] [SEP]

### software version

we identify what version of the malwarebytes privacy application you are
running. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so that we can provide you with updates to the malwarebytes privacy product. [CLS] [SEP]

### malwarebytes privacy’s wireguard public key

your malwarebytes privacy application generates a cryptographic public/private
key pair. [CLS] [SEP]

we only receive the public key which is used to validate and establish a vpn
connection. [CLS] [SEP]

your public/private key pair is periodically changed for increased security. [CLS] [SEP]

### why?

so that your malwarebytes privacy application is able to connect to the vpn
service as allowed under the applicable device limit associated with your
purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

### the malwarebytes privacy application does not collect or retain the
following:

  * details about the websites or ip addresses browsed on your device;
  * dns requests made by you;
  * bandwidth usage on your device;
  * network details of your device, including ip address;
  * telemetry data from the malwarebytes privacy application, including telemetry on functionality and on system environment; or
  * local malwarebytes privacy application logs. [CLS] [SEP] these logs are only available on your device and can be helpful for diagnostic purposes if you experience connectivity issues. [CLS] [SEP] if you have an issue with the application you can choose to submit a copy of the log to our support team, but we do not automatically receive it. [CLS] [SEP]

### website and dialogue collection

as part of our website collection and dialogue collection we collect and we
ask you to provide information about yourself including but not limited to:

  * contact details, including but not limited to your name, address, e-mail address;
  * user id and password, if you establish a malwarebytes account;
  * chat and video conference information, you provide when interacting with our teams;
  * information about your device, including browser type and web traffic information

### why?

providing your data is optional, but it may be necessary for certain services,
accessing content, such as whitepapers and webinars, or to receive customer
support services. [CLS] [SEP] in such cases, if you do not provide your information, we
may not be able to provide you with the requested services. [CLS] [SEP]

### job applicant collection

when you apply for a position at malwarebytes, we ask you to provide
information about yourself including, but not limited to:

  * contact details, including but not limited to your name, address, e-mail address;
  * your past education and job history, and other customary details you include on your resume or curriculum vitae; and
  * voluntary eeo or similar data required to comply with applicable laws, including equal employment opportunity record keeping, reporting, and other legal requirements. [CLS] [SEP] 

### simply

we collect your information when you give it to us as part of a job
application. [CLS] [SEP]

### how do we collect your information?

### directly

some information you (or someone acting on your behalf) provide to us
directly. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you post comments, ask questions in our blog, fill
out a user profile, apply for a job, or voluntarily decide to grant us remote
