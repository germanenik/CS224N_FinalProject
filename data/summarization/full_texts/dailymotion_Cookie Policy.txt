# cookie policy

  

 _last update: may 23rd, 2018_

  

this page contains information on any cookies likely to be saved to your
device, whether it be your computer, cell phone, tablet or smart tv, when
visiting (i) the dailymotion website, accessible at www.dailymotion.com and
elsewhere, including its local or specific extensions (like
advertising.dailymotion.com), and/or (ii) dailymotion apps, and/or (iii) the
dailymotion video player (jointly referred to hereinafter as the **“site”** ). [CLS] [SEP]

# what are cookies?

our chief aim is to ensure that you receive a reliable, effective, and
functional service when browsing on our site. [CLS] [SEP] on occasion, services provided
on the internet need to save certain information on your device (computer,
cell phone, tablet, …) using small files called “cookies”. [CLS] [SEP]

these text files are saved to your computer when you visit a site or view an
ad. [CLS] [SEP] they are handled by your web browser and only the issuer of a cookie is
likely to read the information it contains. [CLS] [SEP]

dailymotion uses cookies on its site to, among other things:

  * measure and analyze the audience for each page in order to subsequently improve the ergonomics, browsing, or visibility of content;
  * measure the reliability of its site by analyzing the number of visits to its pages in real time, and offer varied ads that are adapted to users’ areas of interest;
  * recognize previously identified users whenever they connect (so users are not repeatedly asked for their username and password for each webpage they visit). [CLS] [SEP]

cookies may also be saved by social media tools if you use these
functionalities (facebook, twitter, google+, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]

cookies can be divided into several types: functional cookies, user experience
personalization cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies, and social
network cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

besides how they are used, cookies may also be classified according to their
issuer:

  1. [CLS] [SEP]  **internal cookies** are saved directly by dailymotion (also called first-party cookies);
  2. [CLS] [SEP]  **third-party cookies** are saved by companies of the vivendi group or by dailymotion partners, which are usually advertising partners

  

cookies may consist of « session » cookies that only last for as long as the
site is being visited, or may consist of cookies of a longer duration, which
allow information from one visit to be memorized until the next. [CLS] [SEP]

you can configure cookies settings yourself by accessing the cookie settings
page available at all times on the site. [CLS] [SEP] if you’d like to learn more about
cookies, cnil has prepared an explanatory video entitled “comment j’ai attrapé
un cookie ?”, which can be accessed at the following link:

cookie_tech>

# what are the cookies issued on our site used for?

## internal cookies

internal cookies that are directly saved by dailymotion are mainly functional
cookies. [CLS] [SEP] they are saved on your device primarily for the browsing needs on our
site, identification, and for the optimization and personalization of our
services and content. [CLS] [SEP]

these functional cookies serve the following purposes:

  *  **user authentication cookies** : authentication cookies allow you to access your account using the username you have already provided us with. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **personalization cookies** : personalization cookies make it possible to adapt the appearance of our site to the display preferences on your device (language, display resolution, operating system, security settings, etc.) whenever you visit our site, all according to the tools and software for viewing and playing media present on your device. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **statistics cookies** : statistics cookies allow us to ascertain the use and performance of our site and improve its functioning. [CLS] [SEP] to accomplish this, these cookies track your browsing in order to establish statistics on visits. [CLS] [SEP] for the most part, these cookies are saved and used by dailymotion. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **audience measurement cookies** : dailymotion uses audience measurement cookies (including google analytics) to obtain anonymous visitor statistics for its site, which are then used to optimize it by analyzing the browsing activity of users and detecting any potential malfunctions. [CLS] [SEP]
  *  **functional cookies used to conduct ergonomics/marketing studies** : our site uses an a/b testing solution that relies on cookies to improve the user experience. [CLS] [SEP] a/b testing makes it possible to personalize web content and offer variety. [CLS] [SEP]

most internal functional cookies expire at the end of your visit to our site. [CLS] [SEP]
others have a longer duration, although this never exceeds 13 months in
accordance with current regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

  

## cookies saved by third parties

these are cookies saved on your device by non-affiliated companies when you
browse on our site, or when you click on an advertisement on our site. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  _cookies from the vivendi group_  

as dailymotion is an entity of the vivendi group, cookies are likely to
originate with companies in the vivendi group. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies are considered
“third-party cookies.” cookies from the vivendi group may be saved when
browsing on our site, watching our videos, or when you click on an
advertisement. [CLS] [SEP] they allow for a determination of your areas of interest based
on the pages you visit on our site, and for personalization of the ads we show
you on other sites from the vivendi group, such as canal+, universal,
digitick, wengo, seetickets, radionomy, mybestpro, etc. [CLS] [SEP] for a complete and
updated list of entities belonging to the vivendi group, please visit
<http://www.vivendi.com/en/vivendi-en/vivendi-in-brief-2/>. [CLS] [SEP]

  *  _cookies saved by partners_  
  

    1. [CLS] [SEP]  _third-party advertising cookies: these cookies are saved via third-party content distributed in our advertising spaces_  

advertising cookies are saved by non-affiliated companies (like advertisers,
advertising agencies, communications consulting agencies, audience measurement
companies, providers of targeted advertising, etc.) through the advertising
spaces on our site; the operation of these spaces helps pay for the content
and services that we provide to you free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

first and foremost, these cookies allow us to record the total number of ads
viewed in our advertising spaces, to identify these ads, their number of
respective views, the number of users who have clicked on each ad, and where
applicable, the actions then taken by these users on the sites where these ads
take them, all in order to calculate amounts owed to members of the
advertising distribution chain (communications agency, advertising agency,
distribution site/media) and to establish statistics. [CLS] [SEP]

these advertising cookies also allow us to adjust the advertising content
displayed on your device in our advertising spaces in accordance with the
browsing behavior of your device on our site, or even on the location data
transmitted by your device, where applicable (behavioral advertising). [CLS] [SEP] this
allows you to see the advertisement we believe to be the most suitable for the
user profile on your device. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies also allow us to limit the number
of times you see the same ad on the same media. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not always have final control over these cookies saved by non-affiliated
companies that act independently. [CLS] [SEP] such cookies are subject to the privacy
protection policies of said third parties. [CLS] [SEP] nevertheless, if you wish to refuse
all or some of these cookies, please follow the steps outlined below. [CLS] [SEP]

  

    2. [CLS] [SEP]  _social network cookies (facebook, google+, twitter, pinterest, etc.) generated by share buttons_  

we are likely to include computer applications originating with third parties
on our site. [CLS] [SEP] these applications allow you to share content from our site with
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] these include "share" and "like" buttons from social networks
like facebook, twitter, pinterest or google+. [CLS] [SEP]

social networks providing a share button will likely identify you using this
function, even if you have not used this button during your visit. [CLS] [SEP] this type
of button can allow the social network in question to track your browsing
behavior on our site simply because your social network account was activated
on your device (open session) during your visit. [CLS] [SEP]

we have no control over the process used by social networks to collect
information on your browsing of our site and information pertaining to the
personal data in their possession. [CLS] [SEP] we suggest you consult the privacy
protection policies of these social networks to learn about how browsing
information collected by them through the use of these application buttons
(e.g., for advertising), and ways to disable their tracking functions. [CLS] [SEP]

you may find [here](/files/static/dailymotion_online_cookie_listing.pdf) an
exhaustive listing of all the cookies likely to be saved on your device. [CLS] [SEP] for
more information, do not hesitate to reach out to us through the [dailymotion
help center](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?). [CLS] [SEP]

therefore, on its own, this option does not represent a solution for refusing
all cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

##  _choices available through professional platforms_

digital advertising alliance (edaa), a group of advertising professionals,
allows you to accept or refuse cookies used by companies registered with the

the refusal of cookies will not prevent the display of advertising on our
site. [CLS] [SEP] however, its content will no longer be adapted to the browsing data from
your device. [CLS] [SEP]

  

 _notice_ : we remind you that refusing cookies is likely to modify the terms
of your access to our site as well as its use (viewing our videos, saving
identifying information, receiving personalized recommendations, etc.). [CLS] [SEP]
consequently, we invite you to configure your cookies using the methods
explained above, keeping in mind their purpose, as explained above. [CLS] [SEP]
