that summarize each term. [CLS] [SEP] these are only meant to help you understand the
general meaning and are not legally binding terms of service!

helsinki, finland ("upcloud"), and a customer ("customer") to whom upcloud
provides cloud-based infrastructure and software services for the customer's
commercial purposes ("service"). [CLS] [SEP] in these terms, upcloud and customer are
referred to jointly as the "parties" and individually as a "party". [CLS] [SEP] the
parties expressly acknowledge that the service is neither intended nor fit for
use by consumers. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** these terms are a general agreement between us at upcloud and you
the user. [CLS] [SEP] they exist to protect both you as a user of the provided services
and us as a service provider, and help you understand your rights and
obligations as a customer. [CLS] [SEP]

### agreement documents. [CLS] [SEP]

an agreement is formed between the parties when upcloud receives an
appropriately filled-in registration or order form ("order") which the
customer has submitted through a registration and/or purchasing procedure on
upcloud's website. [CLS] [SEP] in connection with the registration procedure the customer
will create a service account. [CLS] [SEP] any referral herein to "agreement" includes the
order, service descriptions attached or referred to in the order, the service
level agreement ("sla"), the acceptable use policy ("aup") and these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

user instructions and the aup. [CLS] [SEP] the customer must promptly notify upcloud if
the customer suspects that an unauthorised third party is using, or may have
access to, the service or the customer's service account. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** you need to make sure to follow our acceptable usage policy (aup)
and inform us if you think someone else might have accessed your account
without permission. [CLS] [SEP]

### third-party software. [CLS] [SEP]

such software is offered by upcloud for the provision of the service, or if

uploaded by the customer but must always be offered by upcloud. [CLS] [SEP]

settled or awarded in a trial to the third party with respect to any such
claim, provided that upcloud is notified promptly in writing of the claim and
given sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations in
relation to the claim as well as reasonable assistance and necessary
authorisations from customer to defend or settle the claims on behalf of
customer. [CLS] [SEP] at any time, if upcloud reasonably deems that any part of the
service infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, upcloud
has the right at its own expense to (i) modify/replace the service to
eliminate the infringement in such a manner that the modified service complies
with this agreement, or (ii) procure to customer a right to use the service. [CLS] [SEP]
if none of the aforementioned alternatives are reasonably possible, upcloud
shall have the right to terminate this agreement and upcloud shall refund to
customer the prices paid for the service by customer less the price
corresponding the time customer has been able to use the service in accordance
with this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall, however, not be liable for any
infringement or claim thereof in the event the claim (i) is made by any
affiliates of customer; (ii) has resulted from customer’s or customer’s
supplier’s or user’s use or modification of or addition to the service; (iii)

infringements. [CLS] [SEP] customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold upcloud harmless
from and against all liabilities, damages and costs (including settlement
costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any breaches of this
agreement by customer, customer’s personnel and/or users. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we will defend you against any claim that our services infringe on
someone else’s intellectual property rights, as long as you have followed
these rules. [CLS] [SEP] if you receive such a claim, please notify us as soon as possible
so that we can assist you with it. [CLS] [SEP]

### customer data. [CLS] [SEP]

customer data shall mean all customer’s data that a customer or another party
acting on customer’s behalf generates in or submits to the service ("customer
data") or the data customer submits to a third-party service or platform which
might be accessed by the service, subject to and on the basis of the
permissions or consents customer has granted. [CLS] [SEP] customer agrees that upcloud
does not assume any liability or responsibility in respect to any customer
data, with the exceptions relating to personal data as set forth in section
data processing below. [CLS] [SEP] customer shall at all times ensure that customer data
does not infringe any third party intellectual property rights or violate any
applicable laws or legislation. [CLS] [SEP] customer shall not upload any illegal,
offensive, threatening, libellous, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate data
to the service. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, upcloud is not responsible and shall not be held
liable for any customer data, nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any
customer data. [CLS] [SEP] aside from the rights specifically granted herein, customer
retains ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in
the customer data. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** any data uploaded to or generated on your cloud servers are yours
and yours only. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot be held responsible for it and we refrain from
applying our opinions and values towards it, as long as it’s not illegal or
breaking our terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] in additional, we promise to keep your personal
data safely and privately stored. [CLS] [SEP]

### data processing. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to provide the service, upcloud may process personal data on behalf
of the customer as a data processor for the purposes of providing the service. [CLS] [SEP]
upcloud processes certain personal data also as a data controller. [CLS] [SEP] such
personal data includes, inter alia, data of the customer’s contact persons,
invoicing details and other personal data of customer’s contact persons which
upcloud processes in order to maintain the customer relationship. [CLS] [SEP] the
requirements relating to the personal data upcloud processes as data
controller are set out in our privacy policy available on upcloud’s website. [CLS] [SEP]
in this section, "personal data" refers to any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person the customer enters into the service
and upcloud processes on behalf of the customer in the course and within the
scope of providing the services. [CLS] [SEP] in connection with the use of the service,
the customer may transfer various data to upcloud for processing on behalf of
the customer. [CLS] [SEP] such data might include personal data. [CLS] [SEP] the customer shall be
considered as the sole data controller and upcloud as the sole data processor
with respect to such data. [CLS] [SEP] the following terms and conditions set forth in
this section concern the data processing activities of upcloud as a data
processor with respect to the personal data it processes on behalf of the
customer. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we collect and process certain personal data (contact, billing and
behavioural) in compliance with gdpr to better be able to provide you with our
services. [CLS] [SEP] this does not include any personal data you store on your cloud
servers, which are not accessible by us and under your sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

### general requirements relating to processing of personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

the customer shall be responsible for the lawful collection, processing and
use, and for the accuracy of the personal data, as well as for preserving the
rights of the individuals concerned. [CLS] [SEP] if and to the extent legally required,
the customer shall inform the individuals concerned regarding the processing
of their personal data by upcloud, and shall obtain their consent if
necessary. [CLS] [SEP] the personal data processed by upcloud on behalf of the customer
may include e.g. [CLS] [SEP] personal data of the customer’s employees and end-customers,
such as contact details of the aforementioned data subjects. [CLS] [SEP] the customer
acknowledges that due to the nature of the service, upcloud cannot control and
has no obligation to verify personal data the customer transfers to upcloud
for processing on behalf of the customer when the customer uses the service. [CLS] [SEP]
the customer ensures that the customer is entitled to transfer the personal
data to upcloud so that upcloud may lawfully process the personal data on
behalf of the customer in accordance with this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall not
use personal data for any purpose other than that of rendering and providing
the service and will not assert liens or other rights over, or sell or
disclose the personal data to any third parties, without the customer’s prior
written approval. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall process personal data in accordance with this
agreement and documented instructions from the customer. [CLS] [SEP] the customer’s
instructions must be commercially reasonable, compliant with applicable data
protection laws and consistent with this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall not be
obliged to verify whether any instructions given by the customer are
consistent with applicable laws, as the customer is responsible for such
compliance verification of its instructions. [CLS] [SEP] however, if upcloud detects that
any instruction given by the customer is non-compliant with the requirements
of any data protection legislation applicable to upcloud’s operations, upcloud
shall inform the customer in writing. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud and the customer shall comply
with the eu regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such
data ("regulation") and any applicable european or foreign data protection
laws as amended, as well as data protection authorities’ orders and
guidelines. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud and the customer shall implement and maintain appropriate
technical and organizational security measures to protect the personal data
within their area of responsibility, in order to safeguard the personal data
against unauthorised or unlawful processing or access and against accidental
loss, destruction or damage. [CLS] [SEP] such measures include where necessary and
appropriate, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as
well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons the following measures:

  * access right controls to systems containing personal data;
  * the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
  * the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
  * the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
  * a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** if you collect or process any personal data using our services, you
are required to follow the general data protection regulation. [CLS] [SEP]

### upcloud’s assistance obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

to respond to requests from individuals exercising their rights as foreseen in
applicable data protection law, such as the right of access and the right to
rectification or erasure, the customer shall primarily use the corresponding
functions of the services, such as the upcloud control panel. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall
provide the customer with commercially reasonable assistance, without undue
delay, taking into account the nature of the processing. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud shall further
provide the customer with commercially reasonable assistance in ensuring
compliance with the customer’s obligations to perform security and data
protection assessments, breach notifications and prior consultations of the
competent supervisory authority, as set out in the applicable data protection
law, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information
available to upcloud. [CLS] [SEP] in case such assistance requires extensive measures from
upcloud, the customer shall pay additional reasonable remuneration to upcloud
for handling such assistance requests. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, upcloud shall, and shall
procure that its personnel (including its subcontractors’ personnel) shall:

  * only process personal data in accordance with the customer’s written instructions and not for upcloud’s own purposes;
  * ensure that individuals processing personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** you can exercise your right to view, modify, or delete your personal
data through the upcloud control panel. [CLS] [SEP] in cases where you collect and process
any personal data, we can help you to ensure compliance with gdpr. [CLS] [SEP] please note
that extensive work may include additional costs. [CLS] [SEP]

### transfers of personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

the customer accepts that upcloud may have personal data processed and
accessible by its subprocessors outside the customer’s country of domicile to
provide the service. [CLS] [SEP] in case the processing is subject to any eu data
protection law and personal data is transferred from the european economic
area ("eea") to a subprocessor for processing in any country outside the eea
that is not recognized by the european commission as providing an adequate
level of protection for personal data, upcloud provides for appropriate
safeguards by standard contractual clauses, adopted or approved by the
european commission and applicable to the processing by the non-eea
subprocessor or by any other appropriate safeguard as foreseen under
regulation. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** if we need to transfer your personal data to another country outside
the eu we’ll ensure the data remains secure. [CLS] [SEP]

### audits. [CLS] [SEP]

the customer shall have the right to audit the facilities and processing
activities of upcloud under this agreement to examine the level of protection
and security provided for personal data processed under this agreement and to
assess the compliance of upcloud with the terms and conditions relating to
personal data set out herein. [CLS] [SEP] each party shall bear its own costs for any such
audit. [CLS] [SEP] where an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets
of upcloud or threaten intellectual property rights of upcloud, the customer
shall employ an independent expert to carry out the audit, and the expert
shall agree to be bound to confidentiality to upcloud’s benefit. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** you have the right to audit our personal data protection and
security processes. [CLS] [SEP] if the audit would contain confidential information, you
will need to employ an independent expert to do the audit. [CLS] [SEP]

### subprocessors. [CLS] [SEP]

general authorization. [CLS] [SEP] the customer gives its general authorization to allow
upcloud to involve upcloud’s affiliated companies and other subcontractors as
subprocessors to process personal data in connection with the provision of the
service, to the extent such appointment does not lead to non-compliance with
any applicable law or upcloud’s obligations under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud
ensures that the involved subprocessors are properly qualified, will be under
a data processing agreement with upcloud, and comply with data processing
obligations similar to the ones which apply to upcloud under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]
upcloud shall be liable towards the customer for the processing of personal
data carried out by upcloud’s subprocessors. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we might use third-parties that need to process your personal data
