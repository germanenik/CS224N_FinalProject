## **1\. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect**

we may collect personal information about you when you visit our restaurants,
use our websites or mobile apps (“online services”), and otherwise interact
with us (collectively, “services”). [CLS] [SEP] the information we collect falls into
three categories: (a) information you provide us; (b) information we collect
through automated methods, and (c) information we collect from other sources. [CLS] [SEP]

generally, your providing of your personal information is voluntary. [CLS] [SEP] however,
there may be situations where your providing of personal information is
necessary to provide a service or is required by law. [CLS] [SEP] please note that in
certain cases, we may be unable to provide you with our services unless you
provide the information. [CLS] [SEP] we will let you know when the providing of your
personal information is necessary. [CLS] [SEP]

we may combine the information you provide us with information that we collect
through automated methods, and with information we receive from other sources. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, when you add a method of payment to your profile in our mobile
app, we may combine your profile with information we receive from our payment
processors or other providers regarding transactions made with the same
payment credentials in our restaurants. [CLS] [SEP]

### **we collect information you provide us**

for us to collect this information by using the device or web-browser
settings. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions about how to prevent us from collecting
exact information about your location, we recommend you contact your mobile-
device service provider, the device manufacturer, or your web-browser
provider. [CLS] [SEP] some online services and in-restaurant technology may not work
properly without information about your location. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like us to

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] how we share the information we collect

we do not sell your personal information and only share your information as
described in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] please note that some state statutes may
define a “sale” to include sharing of personal information with third parties
for valuable consideration. [CLS] [SEP] many companies have common arrangements with
online advertising networks and analytics companies that may potentially be
considered sales under these definitions. [CLS] [SEP] please review our additional notice

mcdonald's family includes mcdonald’s corporation, our affiliates, our

family who receive this information from us are not authorized to use or share
the information, except as set out in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP]

we may share your personal information with vendors who provide services to
us, such as fulfilling orders, providing data processing and other information
technology services, managing promotions, contests, prize draws and
sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual
mcdonald’s customer experiences. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow these vendors to use this
information or to share it for any purpose other than to provide services on

partners who use the information to detect or prevent fraud for mcdonald’s,
and who may use the information to provide fraud detection and prevention
services to others. [CLS] [SEP]

we may, for strategic or other business reasons, decide to sell or transfer
all or part of our business. [CLS] [SEP] as part of that sale or transfer, we may pass
information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to
anyone involved in the sale or transfer. [CLS] [SEP]

there may be times where we may share information when it does not directly
identify you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share anonymous, aggregated statistics about

specific customer. [CLS] [SEP]

we have the right to use or share personal information as necessary to keep to
any law, regulation or legal request, to protect our online services and in-
restaurant technology, to bring or defend legal claims, to protect the rights,

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] your choices

### marketing communications

if you have agreed to receive marketing communications from us, you can later
opt out by following the opt-out instructions in the marketing communications
we send you. [CLS] [SEP] you can also generally find your communication preferences with
instructions on how to opt out in the profile section of the online services
that you use. [CLS] [SEP] you may also have the ability to change your communication
preferences using your device settings. [CLS] [SEP] you can also opt out by contacting us
at our global or local data protection office using the contact information
provided below. [CLS] [SEP] if you are contacting a local data protection office, please
choose the office in the country in which you are a customer. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still
send communications to you about your transactions, any accounts you have with
us, and any contests, competitions, prize draws or sweepstakes you have
entered. [CLS] [SEP] opting out of one form of communication does not mean you have opted
out of other forms as well. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you opt out of receiving marketing
emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if you have opted in to
receiving them. [CLS] [SEP] please note that if you are receiving communications from a
mcdonald’s franchise, then you will need to opt out from them directly. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct
marketing purposes, unless you give us permission to do so. [CLS] [SEP] when we give you
notice, and you consent, we will share your personal information as you direct
us to. [CLS] [SEP]

### your personal information rights

in certain countries, individuals are entitled to the right to access,
correct, transmit, restrict, delete and object to processing of the personal
information we have collected. [CLS] [SEP] in these certain countries, individuals are
also entitled to withdraw consent to processing of personal information. [CLS] [SEP] for
more information regarding these rights, and the countries where these rights
are available, please see the country specific addendum below. [CLS] [SEP] you can also
visit the [gdpr rights center](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/gdpr-
rights-center.html). [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] use of our online services and other technology

we, and our vendors who provide services to us, may use cookies, web beacons
and other similar technologies on our online services and in other areas
related to our business, such as online advertising, to collect information
and provide you with the services or products that you have requested. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies and other technologies

a “cookie” is a small text file that is placed onto an internet user’s web
browser or device and is used to remember and/or obtain information about the
user. [CLS] [SEP] some countries in which we operate may have a cookies policy. [CLS] [SEP] that
specific information, by country, is provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

a “web beacon” is a small object or image that is embedded into a web page,
application, or email and is used to track activity. [CLS] [SEP] they are also sometimes
referred to as pixels and tags. [CLS] [SEP]

please note the following:

  * you might be assigned a cookie when using our online services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may use both session (for the duration of your visit) and persistent (for the duration of a fixed period of time) cookies and other tracking technologies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * our online services and other areas related to our business may have web beacons. [CLS] [SEP]

we use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology, to collect
information for the purposes described in this privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
combine the information collected by these technologies with information we
have collected about you by other means that are described in this privacy
statement. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use these technologies to:

  * uniquely identify you or your device;
  * allow you to access and use our online services, where without them, our online services may not work properly;
  * further system security where appropriate;
  * statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our websites and mobile apps;
  * improve our products and services;
  * help us monitor the performance (e.g., traffic, errors, page load time, popular sections, etc.) of our online services;
  * remember you, for your convenience, when you visit our online services
  * help customize your experience;
  * to market to you through targeted advertising; and
  * for other purposes described in the section of this privacy statement titled, “how we use the information we collect.”

for example, we may use certain technologies to determine whether you have
opened an e-mail or selected a link contained in an e-mail, how you use the
pages and content in our mobile apps, or whether you have selected a
mcdonald’s online advertisement. [CLS] [SEP]

both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may use these
technologies to collect information about your online activities, over time
and across third-party websites and devices, and when using our online
services to further personalize your experience with us. [CLS] [SEP]

use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or
if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. [CLS] [SEP]
select the “help” section of your browser to learn how to change your cookie
preferences. [CLS] [SEP] if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage
of all the features available on a website. [CLS] [SEP]

some newer web browsers may have a "do not track" preference that transmits a
"do not track" header to the websites you visit with information indicating
that you do not want your activity to be tracked. [CLS] [SEP] mcdonald’s does not
currently take actions to respond to do not track signals because a uniform
technological standard has not yet been developed. [CLS] [SEP] we continue to review new
technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created. [CLS] [SEP]

where video is available on our online services, we may target and track the
videos you view. [CLS] [SEP] you consent to our tracking of your video viewing through
online services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as
otherwise permitted by applicable law, or until you withdraw your consent. [CLS] [SEP]

more information regarding how cookies and technology are used in a country in
which you are a customer may be available in the country specific addendum. [CLS] [SEP]

### targeted advertising

when you use our online services, we (and our vendors who provide services to
us) may collect information about your activities so that we can provide you
with advertising tailored to your interests. [CLS] [SEP]

because we take part in advertising (“ad”) networks, you may see certain ads
on other websites. [CLS] [SEP] ad networks allow us to target the information we send you
based on your interests, other information related to you, and contextual
means. [CLS] [SEP] these ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting
information through use of cookies, web beacons, and web-server logs. [CLS] [SEP] the ad
networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be of
particular interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] the ad networks we take part in may collect
information about your visits to websites that also take part in the relevant
ad network, such as the pages or advertisements you view and how you use the
websites. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information, both on our online services and on third-
party websites that take part in the ad networks, to provide you with
advertising tailored to you, and to help us assess how effective our marketing
is. [CLS] [SEP]

you can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting [the digital advertising
alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [the network
advertising initiative
website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) . [CLS] [SEP] if you
choose to opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements but they will
not be tailored to your interests. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] links to other websites and social media

our online services may offer links to websites that are not run by us but by
third parties. [CLS] [SEP] if you visit one of these linked websites, you should read the
website’s privacy policy, terms and conditions, and their other policies. [CLS] [SEP] we
are not responsible for the policies and practices of third parties. [CLS] [SEP] any
information you give to those organizations is dealt with under their privacy
policy, terms and conditions, and other policies. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also have providers of other apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our
online services, such as facebook “like” buttons, which may also use automated
methods to collect information about how you use these features. [CLS] [SEP] these
organizations may use your information in line with their own policies. [CLS] [SEP]

_back to top_

the below is meant to provide additional information regarding our privacy
practices in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

### children’s privacy notice

we understand how important it is to protect your privacy when you use our
online services. [CLS] [SEP] we are especially committed to protecting the privacy of
children who visit or use our online services. [CLS] [SEP] this section (children's
privacy notice) is designed to answer your questions about how we use the
personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 when they
use our online services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### a. [CLS] [SEP] what personal information do you collect?  

we offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which
children do not have to provide any personal information. [CLS] [SEP] however, sometimes
we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal
address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity. [CLS] [SEP]

here are two examples of information we collect. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we may collect your child's email address so that we can tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake. [CLS] [SEP] we will tell them using the email address they have given us. [CLS] [SEP] we will not keep the email address beyond its expiration or use it for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we may collect your child's email address to respond to a one-off request from them, such as to send them a screen saver. [CLS] [SEP] in these cases we will promptly delete their email address from our system once we have replied to them, and we will not use the address for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

we will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of
13 without the permission of a parent or guardian. [CLS] [SEP] if we need this permission,
we will collect your email address so we can tell you how we use information
and get your permission to collect information from your child. [CLS] [SEP]

we will only ask a child for information that is reasonably necessary for them
to take part in any online activity. [CLS] [SEP]

#### b. [CLS] [SEP] how do you use the personal information you collect?  

we use the email address your child gives us to respond to requests or to tell
them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake
they have entered. [CLS] [SEP] we will use your email address to give you details about
how we use personal information or to get your permission. [CLS] [SEP]

#### c. [CLS] [SEP] how do you share personal information?  

we may share your child's personal information with other people or
organizations if it is reasonably necessary, in the following circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

  * to protect the security or integrity of our online services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * to take precautions against liability. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if we have to reveal the information by law or in response to requests from government authorities. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when we believe sharing the information is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual crime. [CLS] [SEP]

we also may share your child’s personal information with vendors (those who
provide services for us). [CLS] [SEP] these services may include hosting our sites,
providing technical services, meeting requests or managing a contest,
competition, prize draw, or sweepstake. [CLS] [SEP] we do not allow these vendors to share
the personal information we give them unless it is necessary for them to carry
out the service for us. [CLS] [SEP]

#### d. [CLS] [SEP] requests from parents about protecting children's privacy  

you can review personal information we have collected from your child that has
not been deleted, and can ask us to delete personal information from our
records if we have not already done so. [CLS] [SEP] you can also refuse to allow us to
further collect or use your child's personal information, even if you have
previously given us your permission. [CLS] [SEP] to do this, please email or write to us
(our contact details are below). [CLS] [SEP]

#### e. [CLS] [SEP] who should i contact with questions about children’s privacy?  

we urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's online
activities. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any questions about our children’s privacy practices,
please contact us at:

### notice to california residents under 18 years of age  

if you are a registered user of online services under the age of 18, and we
have actual knowledge of your age, then under california law you may request
and obtain removal of certain content or information you have posted on our
online services. [CLS] [SEP] to do so, please contact us at the address, phone number or
email address below. [CLS] [SEP] please note that removal does not ensure complete or
comprehensive removal of the content. [CLS] [SEP] for example, removal may not be possible
or permitted if another provision of law requires the content to be
maintained, if it was posted or reposted by others, or if we paid compensation
to you in exchange for the posting. [CLS] [SEP]
