## newgrounds wiki: privacy policy

here's a breakdown of what information we collect and store about you and why
and how we might process it. [CLS] [SEP] newgrounds is an american company, all data
processing takes part in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] "site" is in most cases a reference to
newgrounds.com where used below. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**personal information - user accounts**  
  
all user accounts, as a bare minimum, store your email address. [CLS] [SEP] you create a
username unique to newgrounds. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you are able to enter further information, such as your first and last name,
although this is not publicly available on the site unless you contribute work
to one of the public portals and you choose to use your real name as
attribution. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
most further information is not required unless you enter into one of our
revenue programs, at which point we collect your full name and postal address,
together with any information required for taxation purposes. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you are able to enter other publicly available information via your public
profile page and can change or withdraw this information at any time. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**social login integration**  
  
we allow you to sign up with and log in via your facebook and google accounts. [CLS] [SEP]
when you initially sign up for an account via these services, your first name
and last name are used to suggest usernames you might want to use on
newgrounds, although whether these are then stored on newgrounds is up to you. [CLS] [SEP]
we do store the email address that's specified in either your facebook or
google account when you register on newgrounds via these services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**information sharing**  
  
we do not share your personal information with any third parties, with the
exception of any direct and credible requests from enforcement agencies in
order to comply with any law, regulation or legal process. [CLS] [SEP] in rare cases, we
may also volunteer your information to law enforcement agencies if we receive
a subpoena or feel you or actions you make on newgrounds pose a risk to us or
to others. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
we may share information you have provided publicly in order to promote work
you have done, or to publicize something you have participated in. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, if you have uploaded a game, animation, piece of art or audio, we may
promote that work. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you have written an interesting blog article,
we may choose to talk about that publicly in our own news posts. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**email**  
  
you may opt in or out of email subscriptions at any time via your [email
subscriptions page](https://www.newgrounds.com/account/subscriptions). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**cookie policy**  
  
we use cookies to store login tokens and minimal information that helps us
identify progress or preferences across the site. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the forums
store a timestamp of when you last visited. [CLS] [SEP] when you return to the site at a
later date, the cookie containing that timestamp is used to identify new posts
that you might not have read. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
older flash based games may store flash cookies on your computer to save your
game progress, preferences or high scores. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
newer games may also store some of their resources on third party websites. [CLS] [SEP]
you may be asked to create accounts outside of newgrounds to enhance your
experience when playing these games. [CLS] [SEP] you should familiarize yourself with the
privacy policies of those websites if you choose to sign up to services of
this type. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
none of the data collected through web beacons, cookies, flash cookies or web
log data provides us with any personal information about you. [CLS] [SEP] we use this data
on an aggregated basis to analyze how our users are interacting with the site
and to customize your experience. [CLS] [SEP] if you are logged in to the site, we could
associate information about your site usage that is collected by cookies with
your user account. [CLS] [SEP] however, we don't do this on an individual basis other than
in cases of suspected abuse or illegal behavior. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
on the web, you can opt out of participating companies by visiting the
following sites:

**ip addresses**  
  
we collect your ip address in areas like registration, sign ins and any
information you might post on the site (like forum posts). [CLS] [SEP] this helps us
distinguish between users, find common patterns in our moderation systems and
to give us an idea as to whether or not multiple account names might actually
belong to the same person. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
if you're a registered user, ip addresses are also used to show you rough
location estimates in your account login section, so you can potentially spot
any suspicious activity on your account. [CLS] [SEP] we also use ip addresses for non
logged in users to display content that they may not have already seen. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**device information**  
  
we collect generic information about the device you're using on newgrounds in
order to determine how best to serve the content to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you
are using a mobile device, we will attempt to render a mobile version of the
site for you wherever possible. [CLS] [SEP] again, logged in users will these devices in
the logged in sessions section of their account. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**security**  
  
we follow industry standards to store and protect data we collect and utilize
encryption where appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**retention**

information like ip address logs indefinitely to help us better understand
patterns across the site or as a partial means of identifying return
problematic users. [CLS] [SEP]

deletion. [CLS] [SEP]
