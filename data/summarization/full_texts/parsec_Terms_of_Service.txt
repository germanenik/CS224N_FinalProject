# terms of service

 **last revised: december 11, 2020**

please read this legal document carefully. [CLS] [SEP] parsec cloud, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (together with
our affiliates, âparsecâ, âweâ, or âusâ) provides simple, low-
latency game streaming through desktop and mobile applications available for
download. [CLS] [SEP] this website and its subdomains (collectively, the âsiteâ), all
software and associated documentation that is made available to you by parsec
(âsoftwareâ), all parsec mobile applications (collectively, the âmobile
appâ), and the services and resources available or enabled via the site,
software, or the mobile app (each a âserviceâ and collectively the
âservicesâ) are controlled by parsec. [CLS] [SEP] by registering on the site or mobile
application or by visiting, browsing, or using any of the services in any way,
you (âuserâ or âyouâ) accept these terms of use (the âtermsâ). [CLS] [SEP]

these terms are legally binding and govern your use of each of the services,
including the software. [CLS] [SEP] by accessing or using any of the services, you are
accepting these terms (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you
represent), and you represent and warrant that (1) you have read, understand
and agree to be bound by these terms, (2) you are at least 18 years old or the
age of majority in the jurisdiction from which you are accessing the services
(or are at least 13 years old and have your parent or legal guardianâs
consent) and (3) you have the authority to enter into the terms personally or
on behalf of the legal entity identified during the account registration
process, and to bind that legal entity to the terms. [CLS] [SEP] if you, or if applicable,
such legal entity, do not agree to be bound by the terms, you, and if
applicable, such legal entity, may not access or use any of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

if you subscribe to the services for a term (the âinitial termâ), the
terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same
duration as the initial term at parsecâs then-current fees for such services
unless you opt out of the auto-renewal in accordance with section 5.7
(automatic renewal) below. [CLS] [SEP]

please be aware that section 2.9 (parsec communications) of the terms below
contains your opt-in consent to receive communications from us, including, as
applicable, via e-mail. [CLS] [SEP]

please be aware that section 15.2 (dispute resolution) of the terms below
contains provisions governing how any disputes between us will be resolved. [CLS] [SEP] in
particular, it contains an arbitration agreement which will, with limited
exceptions, require disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement: (1) you will
only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual
basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative
action or proceeding; and (2) you are waiving your right to pursue claims and
seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial. [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] ## accounts

    1. [CLS] [SEP] ### account creation. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to access certain services, you must register for an account
(âaccountâ) and provide certain information about yourself. [CLS] [SEP] you represent
and warrant that: (a) all account information you submit is truthful and
accurate, and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. [CLS] [SEP] if you
provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
or parsec has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide
is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, parsec has the right to
suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use
of the services (or any portion thereof). [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to create an account
or use the services if you have been previously banned from any of the
services by parsec. [CLS] [SEP] you may delete your account at any time, for any reason,
from the âaccountâ page on the site. [CLS] [SEP] parsec may suspend or terminate your
account in accordance with section 11. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### account responsibilities. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login
information and for all activities that occur under your account. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to
immediately notify parsec of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized
use of your account or any other breach of security. [CLS] [SEP] you may not share your
account login or password with anyone, and you agree to exit from your account
at the end of each session. [CLS] [SEP] parsec cannot and will not be liable for any loss
or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section 1.2. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### your account. [CLS] [SEP]

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the terms, you acknowledge and
agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in your
account, and you further acknowledge and agree that all rights in and to your
account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of parsec. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] ### necessary equipment and software. [CLS] [SEP]

you must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the
services, including but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to
connect with and use the mobile app. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible for any fees,
including internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing
the services. [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] ## use of the services

the services, and the information and content available on them, are protected
by applicable intellectual property laws. [CLS] [SEP] unless subject to a separate license
between you and parsec, your right to use any and all services is subject to
the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

    1. [CLS] [SEP] ### mobile app license. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to your compliance with the terms, parsec grants you a limited, non-
exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download,
install and use a copy of the mobile app on a single mobile device that you
own or control and to run such copy of the mobile app solely for your own
personal or internal business purposes. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, with respect to any
mobile app accessed through or downloaded from the apple app store (an âapp
store sourced applicationâ), you will only use such app store sourced
application (a) on an apple-branded product that runs ios (appleâs
proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the âusage rulesâ
set forth in the apple app store terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the first
sentence in this section, with respect to any mobile app accessed through or
downloaded from the google play store (a âgoogle play sourced
applicationâ), you may have additional license rights with respect to use of
such google play sourced application on a shared basis within your designated
family group. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### parsec software. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to your compliance with the terms, parsec grants you a limited, non-
assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-exclusive
license to use, access and download (as applicable) the software on computer
equipment you own or control solely for your own personal, noncommercial use
including to make your computer available to other individuals on a hosted
basis, and solely to stream content that you own or otherwise have the right
to use and stream. [CLS] [SEP] as a subscriber of parsec âteamsâ or a member of a
âteamâ in parsec, you may use the applicable software to connect to or
host sessions for commercial use. [CLS] [SEP] some elements of the software may be subject
to open source licenses that we will make available to you upon your request. [CLS] [SEP]
there may be provisions in the open source licenses that expressly override
some of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### updates. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand that the services are evolving. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, parsec may require
you to accept updates to services that you have installed on your computer or
mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that parsec may update the services
with or without notifying you. [CLS] [SEP] you may need to update third-party software
from time to time in order to use the services. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] ### restrictions. [CLS] [SEP]

the licenses granted in sections 2.1 and 2.2 are subject to the following

otherwise indicated, any future release, update, or other addition to
functionality of the services will be subject to the terms. [CLS] [SEP] all copyright and
other proprietary notices on the services (or on any content displayed on the
services) must be retained on all copies thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

    5. [CLS] [SEP] ### modification. [CLS] [SEP]

parsec reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue all
or any elements of the services (in whole or in part) with or without notice
to you. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that parsec will not be liable to you or to any third party
for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuation. [CLS] [SEP]

    6. [CLS] [SEP] ### no support or maintenance. [CLS] [SEP]

except for the limited support services offered to parsec âteamsâ
subscribers, you acknowledge and agree that parsec will have no obligation to
provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP]

    7. [CLS] [SEP] ### third-party materials. [CLS] [SEP]

as a part of the services, you may have access to materials that are hosted by
another party. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that it is impossible for parsec to monitor such

emails, you can unsubscribe from our promotional email list by following the
unsubscribe options in the promotional email itself. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] ## privacy

any information that you provide to parsec, as well as any information that

to the collection and use (as set forth in the privacy policy) of this
information. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] ## responsibility for content

    1. [CLS] [SEP] ### user content. [CLS] [SEP]

usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your user content that personally
identifies you or any third party. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby represent and warrant that your
user content does not and will not violate the acceptable use policy referred
to in section 4.4, and that you are either the creator and owner of the user
content or have sufficient rights and authority to make your user content
available as contemplated by these terms, including to stream the user content
through the software. [CLS] [SEP] you may not represent or imply to others that your user
content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by parsec. [CLS] [SEP] unless
otherwise specified with respect to a particular parsec offering, parsec is
not obligated to backup any user content, and your user content, to the extent
stored on parsec equipment, may be deleted at any time without prior notice. [CLS] [SEP]
you are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies
of your user content if you desire. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### license. [CLS] [SEP]

to the extent that you provide user content to parsec (in connection with
reviews, communications with other members, message boards, etc.), you hereby
grant (and represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) parsec an
irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully-paid-up, worldwide license
to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative
works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit such
user content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing rights, in connection
with the operation and improvement of the services. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby irrevocably
waive (and agree to cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral
rights or attribution with respect to your user content. [CLS] [SEP] **for the sake of
clarity, parsec does not, and will not (unless required by law), record user
content streamed over the service or otherwise use, disclose, or share such
streamed user content with any third parties.**

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### acceptable use policy. [CLS] [SEP]

      1. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to use the services to collect, upload, transmit, display, stream, or distribute any user content (i) that violates any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) that is unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of anotherâs privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive, promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual or is otherwise objectionable; (iii) that is harmful to minors in any way; (iv) that is in violation of any law, regulation, or obligations or restrictions imposed by any third party; or (v) that you do not have the right to so collect, upload, transmit, display, stream, or distribute. [CLS] [SEP]

      2. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you agree not to: (i) upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the services any computer viruses, worms, or any software intended to damage or alter a computer system or data; (ii) send through the services unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of duplicative or unsolicited messages, whether commercial or otherwise; (iii) use the services to harvest, collect, gather or assemble information or data regarding other users, including e-mail addresses, without their consent; (iv) interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on servers or networks connected to the services, or violate the regulations, policies or procedures of such networks; (v) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the services (or to other computer systems or networks connected to or used together with the services), whether through password mining or any other means; (vi) harass or interfere with any other userâs use and enjoyment of the services; or (vi) use software or automated agents or scripts to produce multiple accounts on the services, or to generate automated searches, requests, or queries to (or to strip, scrape, or mine data from) the site (provided, however, that we conditionally grant to the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials, subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file). [CLS] [SEP]

      3. [CLS] [SEP] parsec takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any user content or for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, nor is parsec liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter in user content when using the services. [CLS] [SEP] your use of the services is at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, these rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the services will not contain any content that is prohibited by these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] ### enforcement. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to investigate and/or take
appropriate action against you in our sole discretion with respect to your
user content if you violate the acceptable use policy or any other provision
of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] such action may include removing or modifying your user
content, terminating your account in accordance with section 11, and/or
reporting you to law enforcement authorities. [CLS] [SEP]

    5. [CLS] [SEP] ### feedback. [CLS] [SEP]

if you provide parsec with any feedback or suggestions regarding the services
(âfeedbackâ), you hereby assign to parsec all rights in such feedback and
agree that parsec will have the right to use and fully exploit such feedback
and related information in any manner it deems appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] parsec will treat
any feedback you provide to parsec as non-confidential and non-proprietary. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that you will not submit to parsec any information or ideas that you
consider to be confidential or proprietary. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP] ## fees and purchase terms

    1. [CLS] [SEP] ### service subscription fees. [CLS] [SEP]

you will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any paid
subscription services (each, a âservice subscription feeâ) at the time you
select your payment package (the âservice commencement dateâ). [CLS] [SEP] except as
set forth in the terms, all fees for the services are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] no
contract will exist between you and parsec for the services until parsec
accepts your order. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### payment. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to pay the applicable fees or charges to your account via stripe or
another third party payment services provider used by parsec. [CLS] [SEP] any agreement
you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your specified
payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit
them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing
cycle. [CLS] [SEP] we may submit those charges for payment, and you will be responsible
for such charges. [CLS] [SEP] this does not waive our right to seek payment directly from
you. [CLS] [SEP] parsec reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing
methods, either immediately upon posting on the services or by e-mail delivery
to you. [CLS] [SEP] you will be required to provide a valid credit, charge or debit card
number from a card issuer that we accept as a condition to signing up for any
paid subscription services â your authorizations in this section also apply
to our third party payment processor and any other company who acts as a
billing agent for us. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby authorize us to charge your specified payment
method for any subscription services. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize the issuer of your
selected payment method to pay any amounts described herein without requiring
a signed receipt. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize us to continue to attempt to charge and/or
place holds with respect to all sums described herein, or any portion thereof,
to your payment method until such amounts are paid in full. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to
provide updated payment information upon request and any time the information
you previously provided is no longer valid. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### taxes. [CLS] [SEP]

the service subscription fees do not include any sales tax that may be due in
connection with the subscription services, and you are solely responsible for
the payment of all such sales taxes and you agree to indemnify parsec for any
liability or expense parsec may incur in connection with such sales taxes. [CLS] [SEP] if
parsec determines it has a legal obligation to collect a sales tax from you in
connection with such services, parsec may collect such sales tax in addition
to the payments required under the terms. [CLS] [SEP] upon parsecâs request, you will
provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority,
or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes
of this section, âsales taxâ shall mean any sales or use tax and any other
tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales
tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales
or use tax. [CLS] [SEP]

    4. [CLS] [SEP] ### automatic renewal. [CLS] [SEP]

your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance
with the terms. [CLS] [SEP] **after your initial subscription period, and again after any
subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence
on the first day following the end of such period (each a ârenewal
commencement dateâ) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at
parsecâs then-current price for such subscription. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that your
account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel
your subscription prior to the renewal commencement date, by logging into and
going to the âchange/cancel membershipâ page of your âaccount
settingsâ page. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically,
or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please contact parsec
at[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or log in and go to the
âchange/cancel membershipâ page on your âaccount settingsâ page.** if
you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of
your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed
after your then-current term expires. [CLS] [SEP] however, you will not be eligible for a
prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-
current subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] by subscribing, you authorize parsec to charge
your payment provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent
subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] upon renewal of your subscription, if parsec does not
receive payment from your payment provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts
due on your account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that parsec may either
terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your
payment provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your
account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new
subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). [CLS] [SEP]

  6. [CLS] [SEP] ## indemnification

you agree to indemnify and hold parsec (and its officers, employees, agents,
suppliers, and licensors) harmless, including costs and attorneysâ fees,
from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a)
your use of the services, (b) your violation of the terms, (c) your violation
of applicable laws or regulations, or (d) your user content. [CLS] [SEP] parsec reserves
the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate
with our defense of these claims. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to settle any indemnifiable
matter without our prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] parsec will use reasonable efforts
to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of

this section 8 shall not apply to subscribers of parsec teams. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] ## disclaimers

    1. [CLS] [SEP] ### as is. [CLS] [SEP]

you expressly understand and agree that the services are provided on an âas-
isâ and âas availableâ basis, and parsec (and our suppliers) expressly
disclaim any warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express, implied,
or statutory, including all warranties or conditions of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or non-
infringement. [CLS] [SEP] we (and our suppliers) make no warranty that the services will
meet your requirements, will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure,
or error-free basis, or will be accurate, reliable, free of viruses or other
harmful code, complete, legal, or safe. [CLS] [SEP] if applicable law requires any
warranties with respect to the parsec properties, all such warranties are
limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the date of first use. [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the
above exclusion may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may
not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

from time to time, parsec may offer new âbetaâ features or tools with
which its users may experiment. [CLS] [SEP] such features or tools are offered solely for
experimental purposes and without any warranty of any kind, and may be
modified or discontinued at parsecâs sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the provisions of this
section apply with full force to such features or tools. [CLS] [SEP]

  10. [CLS] [SEP] ## limitation on liability

to the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will parsec (or our
suppliers) be liable to you or any third party for any lost profits, lost
data, costs of procurement of substitute products, or any indirect,
consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising from
or relating to these terms or your use of, or inability to use, the services,
even if parsec has been advised of the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] access to,
and use of, the services is at your own discretion and risk, and you will be
solely responsible for any damage to your device or computer system, or loss
of data resulting therefrom. [CLS] [SEP]

to the maximum extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any damages arising from
or related to these terms (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form
of the action), will at all times be limited to $100. [CLS] [SEP] the existence of more
than one claim will not enlarge this limit. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that our suppliers will
have no liability of any kind arising from or relating to the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

the limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the
basis of the bargain between parsec and you. [CLS] [SEP]

  11. [CLS] [SEP] ## term and termination

for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision of the terms, or
if parsec is required to do so by law, parsec has the right to, immediately
and without notice, suspend or terminate any services provided to you. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in parsecâs sole

subscription in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 5.6. [CLS] [SEP]

upon termination of your rights under these terms, your account and right to
access and use the services will terminate immediately. [CLS] [SEP] termination of your
account may involve deletion of user content associated with your account. [CLS] [SEP]
parsec will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of
your rights under these terms, including for termination of your account or
deletion of your user content. [CLS] [SEP] all provisions of the terms which by their
nature should survive, shall survive termination of services, including
without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation
of liability. [CLS] [SEP]

  12. [CLS] [SEP] ## international users

the services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain
references to services and content that are not available in your country. [CLS] [SEP]
these references do not imply that parsec intends to announce such services or
content in your country. [CLS] [SEP] the services are controlled and offered by parsec
from its facilities in the united states of america. [CLS] [SEP] parsec makes no
representations that the services are appropriate or available for use in

  13. [CLS] [SEP] ## copyright policy

parsec respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of the
services do the same. [CLS] [SEP] in connection with the services, we have adopted and
implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of
any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate
circumstances, of users of the services who are repeat infringers of
intellectual property rights, including copyrights. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that one of
our users is, through the use of the services, unlawfully infringing the
copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material
removed, the following information in the form of a written notification

    * a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that, pursuant to 17 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] â§ 512(f), any misrepresentation of
material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining

application license, e.g., the apple app store or google play (âapp
storeâ). [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that the terms are between you and parsec and not
with the app store. [CLS] [SEP] parsec, not the app store, is solely responsible for the

liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). [CLS] [SEP] in order

agree to pay all fees associated with such access. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to pay all
fees (if any) charged by the app store in connection with the services. [CLS] [SEP] you

your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the
app storeâs terms and policies) when using the services. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge
that the app store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the
terms and will have the right to enforce them. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### third-party providers. [CLS] [SEP]

parsec uses stripe, inc. [CLS] [SEP] and its affiliates as its third party service
provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and
related services). [CLS] [SEP] when purchasing a subscription to any of the services, you
agree to be bound by stripeâs privacy policy (currently accessible at
https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and its terms of service (currently accessible

[CLS] [SEP]

      4. [CLS] [SEP] you and parsec acknowledge that, as between parsec and apple, apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the app store sourced application or your possession and use of the app store sourced application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app store sourced application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. [CLS] [SEP]

      5. [CLS] [SEP] you and parsec acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the app store sourced application or your possession and use of that app store sourced application infringes that third partyâs intellectual property rights, as between parsec and apple, parsec, not apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the terms. [CLS] [SEP]

      6. [CLS] [SEP] you and parsec acknowledge and agree that apple, and appleâs subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of the terms as related to your license of the app store sourced application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the terms, apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms as related to your license of the app store sourced application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the
changes on this page and elsewhere in the services. [CLS] [SEP] if the last e-mail address

our posting of notice of the changes on this page and in the services. [CLS] [SEP] these
changes will be effective immediately for new users of the services. [CLS] [SEP] continued
use of the services following notice of such changes will indicate your
acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and
conditions of such changes. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] ### dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

 **please read this section 15.2 (the âarbitration agreementâ) carefully. [CLS] [SEP]
it is part of your contract with parsec and affects your rights. [CLS] [SEP] it contains
procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.**

applicability of arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] all claims and disputes (excluding
claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in
connection with the terms or the use of any product or service provided by
parsec that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be
resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this
arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings
will be held in english. [CLS] [SEP] **this arbitration agreement applies to you and
parsec, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the
terms.**

additional rules for non-appearance based arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if non-appearance-based
arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online
and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner will be chosen
by the party initiating the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will not involve any
personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

time limits. [CLS] [SEP] if you or parsec pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must
be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the
legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the
aaa rules for the pertinent claim. [CLS] [SEP]

authority of arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] if arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will
decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and parsec, and the dispute
will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
or parties. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions
dispositive of all or part of any claim. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may award monetary
damages, and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
individual under applicable law, the aaa rules, and the terms. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
calculation of any damages awarded. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator has the same authority to
award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. [CLS] [SEP]
the award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and parsec. [CLS] [SEP]

waiver of jury trial. [CLS] [SEP] the parties hereby waive their constitutional and
statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a
jury, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by
arbitration under this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration procedures are
typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable
in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. [CLS] [SEP] in the event any
litigation should arise between you and parsec in any state or federal court
in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, you and
parsec waive all rights to a jury trial, instead electing that the dispute be
resolved by a judge. [CLS] [SEP]

waiver of class or consolidated actions. [CLS] [SEP] all claims and disputes within the
scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an
individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one user
cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any
other user. [CLS] [SEP]

if a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of
any of this sectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request
for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought
into the state or federal courts located in the state of new york. [CLS] [SEP] all other
disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. [CLS] [SEP]

confidentiality. [CLS] [SEP] all aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the
award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly
confidential. [CLS] [SEP] the parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise
required by law. [CLS] [SEP] this paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a
court of law any information necessary to enforce this arbitration agreement
or an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. [CLS] [SEP]

severability. [CLS] [SEP] if any part of this arbitration agreement are found to be
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such
specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and
the remainder of the arbitration agreement will continue in full force and
effect. [CLS] [SEP]

right to waive. [CLS] [SEP] any or all the rights and limitations set forth in this
arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is
asserted. [CLS] [SEP] such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this
arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

small claims court.notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or parsec may
bring an individual action in small claims court. [CLS] [SEP]

emergency equitable relief. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may
seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to
maintain the status quo pending arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] a request for interim measures
will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this
arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

claims not subject to arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of
defamation, violation of the computer fraud and abuse act, and infringement or
misappropriation of the other partyâs patent, copyright, trademark or trade
secrets will not be subject to this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits the
parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within new york
county, new york, for such purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

you have the right to opt out of the provisions of this arbitration agreement
by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: [[email
protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within thirty (30) days after first
becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] your notice must include your
name and address, your parsec username (if any), the email address you used to
set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you
want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of this
arbitration agreement, all other parts of this agreement will continue to
apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any
other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the
future, with us. [CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ### export. [CLS] [SEP]

consent to receive electronic communications from parsec; and (b) agree that
all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
communications that parsec provides to you electronically satisfy any legal
requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy
writing. [CLS] [SEP] the foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including but
not limited to the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act
at 15 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] â§7001 et seq. [CLS] [SEP] (âe-signâ). [CLS] [SEP]

    6. [CLS] [SEP] ### entire terms. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the
use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision
of these terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] the
section titles in these terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP] the word âincludingâ means âincluding without
limitationâ. [CLS] [SEP] the word âmayâ means âhas the right, but not the
obligation, toâ. [CLS] [SEP] if any provision of these terms is, for any reason, held to
be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these terms will be
unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified
so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. [CLS] [SEP]
your relationship to parsec is that of an independent contractor, and neither
party is an agent or partner of the other. [CLS] [SEP] these terms, and your rights and
obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or

attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the
foregoing will be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] parsec may freely assign these terms. [CLS] [SEP] the
terms and conditions set forth in these terms will be binding upon assignees. [CLS] [SEP]

shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original
intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full
force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
