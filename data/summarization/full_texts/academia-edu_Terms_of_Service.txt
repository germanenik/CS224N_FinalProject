**account registration**

in order to access certain features of the site and services and to post any

you may register directly via the site or by logging into your account with

(including, but not limited to, facebook) via the site, as described herein. [CLS] [SEP]
if you decide to register through an sns, we will extract the personal
information you have provided to the sns (such as your “real” name, email
address and other information you make publicly available via the sns) from
the account you have with the applicable sns and use that information to
create your account. [CLS] [SEP] the specific information that we extract may depend on
the privacy settings you have with the sns. [CLS] [SEP] you hereby consent to our access
to and collection of such personal information about you. [CLS] [SEP] during the
registration process, you will be required to provide certain information and
you will establish a username and a password. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the
registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate,
current and complete. [CLS] [SEP] academia.edu reserves the right to suspend or terminate
your account if any information provided during the registration process or
thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. [CLS] [SEP] you are
responsible for safeguarding your password. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you will not
disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole
responsibility for any activities or actions under your account, whether or
not you have authorized such activities or actions. [CLS] [SEP] you will immediately
notify academia.edu of any unauthorized use of your account. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**privacy**

see academia.edu’s privacy policy at
[academia.edu/privacy](https://www.academia.edu/privacy) for information and
notices concerning academia.edu’s collection and use of your personal
information. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**payments**

academia.edu may offer you the ability to access certain features through
purchase of a recurring subscription (“subscription”). [CLS] [SEP]

when you purchase a subscription or make any other paid feature related
purchase via the services (each, a “transaction”), you expressly authorize us
(or our third party payment processor, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] stripe) to charge you for such
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] we may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your
transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the
expiration date of your credit card, your billing address and additional
information to verify your identity before completing your transaction (such
information, “payment information”). [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that you have
the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such payment
information. [CLS] [SEP] when you initiate a transaction, you authorize us to store and
continue billing you using your payment information and to provide your
payment information to our third party payment processors as needed to
complete your transactions. [CLS] [SEP] we may also periodically authorize your payment
method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. [CLS] [SEP] further, as part
of our order processing procedures, we may screen orders for fraud or other
undesirable activity. [CLS] [SEP] if we feel an order could be fraudulent, unauthorized,
or illegal, we reserve the right to refuse to process that order. [CLS] [SEP] your
subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to
or use of the services or the subscription in accordance with these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

if you elect to purchase an annual or monthly subscription, you will be
charged the annual or monthly subscription fee (“subscription fee”) plus any
applicable taxes, at the beginning of your subscription and each year or month
thereafter, respectively, at the then-current rate. [CLS] [SEP] if you elect to purchase
an annual subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will
automatically charge you on the anniversary of the commencement of your
subscription using the payment information you have provided. [CLS] [SEP] if you elect to
purchase a monthly subscription, we (or our third party payment processor)
will automatically charge you each month, on the calendar day corresponding to
the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have
provided. [CLS] [SEP] in the event your subscription began on a day not contained in a
given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable
month or such other day as we deem appropriate. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you started
your subscription on january 31st, your next payment date is likely to be
february 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. [CLS] [SEP]

by agreeing to these terms and electing to purchase a subscription, you
acknowledge that your subscription has recurring payment features and you
accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to
cancellation of your subscription by you or academia.edu. [CLS] [SEP]

_free trials._ we may offer subscriptions on a free trial basis (“free trial”)
for a specified period of time. [CLS] [SEP] if we offer you a free trial, the specific
terms of your free trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional
materials describing the free trial and your use of the free trial is subject
to your compliance with such specific terms. [CLS] [SEP] free trials may not be combined
with any other offer. [CLS] [SEP] except as may otherwise be provided in the specific
terms for the free trial offer, free trials are only available to users who
have not previously subscribed to the service in connection with which the
free trial is being offered. [CLS] [SEP] when you agree to a free trial, you are also
agreeing to sign up for a subscription as described above and, consequently,
unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of your free trial, we
(or our third party payment processor) will begin charging your payment method
on a recurring basis for the subscription fee (plus any applicable taxes)
until you cancel your subscription. [CLS] [SEP] instructions for cancelling your
subscription are stated below in the “cancelling subscriptions” section. [CLS] [SEP] we
reserve the right to modify or terminate free trials at any time, without
notice and in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

_cancelling subscriptions_

you may cancel your subscription at any time. [CLS] [SEP] please note, however, that,
except for the thirty (30) day period following the start of your
subscription, all sales are final. [CLS] [SEP] after the first thirty (30) day period
following the start of your subscription you will not receive a refund of any
portion of the subscription fee paid for the then current subscription period
at the time of cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] to cancel, you can either (i) email us at
support@academia.edu and follow instructions, if any, we provide to you in
response to your cancellation request, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through
your account settings within the services. [CLS] [SEP] you will be responsible for all
subscription fees incurred for the then current subscription period. [CLS] [SEP] if you
cancel, your cancellation will be effective immediately, but academia.edu will
allow you to access the subscription features until the most recently paid-up
subscription period ends, and then we will terminate your access. [CLS] [SEP] cancelling
your subscription won’t cancel your account. [CLS] [SEP] see the termination and account
cancellation section below for information on canceling your account. [CLS] [SEP]

please be aware that any fee or subscription plan is exclusive of all taxes. [CLS] [SEP]
if at any point any applicable sales use, vat, gst, excise, withholding or
similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, exist, the member is
liable for them. [CLS] [SEP]

if we believe, in our sole discretion, that any member of academia.edu or
academia premium or other academia.edu paid services is in breach of our
terms, or act outside of the letter or spirit of our terms, we reserve the
right to add limitations to your access to www.academia.edu, up to and
including terminating all access to www.academia.edu. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, the member
in question is not eligible for any refunds on any portion of their
subscription payment. [CLS] [SEP]

**controlling law**

these terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the
state of california without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**entire agreement**

these terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
between academia.edu and you regarding the site, services and collective
content, and these terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or
written understandings or agreements between academia.edu and you regarding
the site, services and collective content. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**assignment**

you may not assign or transfer these terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
without academia.edu’s prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] any attempt by you to assign or
transfer these terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. [CLS] [SEP]
academia.edu may assign or transfer these terms, at its sole discretion,
without restriction. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the foregoing, these terms will bind and inure
to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**notices**

any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including
those regarding modifications to these terms, will be in writing and given by
academia.edu (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or
(ii) by posting to the site. [CLS] [SEP] for notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt
will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. [CLS] [SEP]

  

**dispute resolution**

you and academia.edu agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to these terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the site or services
(collectively, “ **disputes** ”) will be settled by binding arbitration,
except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in
small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the
action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “ **ip protection action**
”). [CLS] [SEP] (the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) are the “ **litigable
actions.** ”). [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the
right to litigate any dispute other than a litigable action, if you provide
academia.edu with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular
mail at 580 california st, suite 400, san francisco, ca, 94104 within thirty
(30) days following the date you first agree to these terms (such notice, an “
**arbitration opt-out notice** ”). [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t provide academia.edu with an
arbitration opt-out notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be
deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any
dispute except for litigable actions. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
any ip protection action or, if you timely provide academia.edu with an
arbitration opt-out notice, any dispute other than an individual action
brought in small claims court, will be the state and federal courts located in
the northern district of california and each of the parties hereto waives any
objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. [CLS] [SEP] unless you timely provide
cir with an arbitration opt-out notice, **you acknowledge and agree that you
and academia.edu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or
representative proceeding**. [CLS] [SEP] further, unless both you and academia.edu
otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if this specific paragraph is held unenforceable,
then the entirety of this “dispute resolution” section will be deemed void. [CLS] [SEP]
except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “dispute resolution”
section will survive any termination of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

_arbitration rules and governing law._ the arbitration will be administered by
the american arbitration association (“aaa”) in accordance with the commercial
arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related
disputes (the “aaa rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “dispute
resolution” section. [CLS] [SEP] (the aaa rules are available at
[www.adr.org/arb_med](/terms) or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879.) the
federal arbitration act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
section. [CLS] [SEP]

_arbitration process._ a party who desires to initiate arbitration must
provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration as specified in
the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] (the aaa provides a form demand for arbitration at
[http://www.adr.org/aaa/showpdf?doc=adrstg_004175](/terms) and a separate form
for california residents at
[http://www.adr.org/aaa/showpdf?doc=adrstg_015822](/terms).) the arbitrator
will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and
will be selected by the parties from the aaa’s roster of arbitrators. [CLS] [SEP] if the
parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
delivery of the demand for arbitration, then the aaa will appoint the
arbitrator in accordance with the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

_arbitration location and procedure._ unless you and academia.edu otherwise
agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. [CLS] [SEP] if
your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted
solely on the basis of the documents that you and academia.edu submit to the
arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a
hearing is necessary. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing
will be determined by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the aaa rules, the arbitrator
will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

_arbitrator’s decision._ the arbitrator will render an award within the time
frame specified in the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s decision will include the
essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. [CLS] [SEP]
judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with
the terms of the “limitation of liability” section above as to the types and
the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] if you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an
award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable
law. [CLS] [SEP] academia.edu will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have
under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails
in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

_fees._ your responsibility to pay any aaa filing, administrative and
arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] however, if your
claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, academia.edu will pay all such fees
unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for
an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of
civil procedure 11(b)). [CLS] [SEP]

_changes._ notwithstanding the provisions of the “modification” section above,
if academia.edu changes this “dispute resolution” section after the date you
first accepted these terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including
by email to [feedback@academia.edu](mailto:feedback@academia.edu)) within 30
days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “last
updated date” above or in the date of academia.edu’s email to you notifying
you of such change. [CLS] [SEP] by rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
arbitrate any dispute between you and academia.edu in accordance with the
provisions of this “dispute resolution” section as of the date you first
accepted these terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these terms). [CLS] [SEP]

  

**general**

the failure of academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these terms
will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. [CLS] [SEP]
the waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing
and signed by a duly authorized representative of academia.edu. [CLS] [SEP] except as
expressly set forth in these terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
remedies under these terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
under these terms or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a court of competent
jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms invalid or unenforceable, that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
