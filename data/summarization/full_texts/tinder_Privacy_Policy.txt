###  2\. [CLS] [SEP] where this privacy policy applies

this privacy policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services
operated by tinder. [CLS] [SEP] for simplicity, we refer to all of these as our
âservicesâ in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] to make it extra clear, weâve added
links to this privacy policy on all applicable services. [CLS] [SEP]

some services may require their own unique privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if a particular
service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this privacy
policy -- applies. [CLS] [SEP]

###  3\. [CLS] [SEP] information we collect

it goes without saying, we canât help you develop meaningful connections
without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the
types of people youâd like to meet. [CLS] [SEP] we also collect information generated as
you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from
third parties, like when you access our services through a social media
account. [CLS] [SEP] if you want additional info, we go into more detail below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information you give us

you choose to give us certain information when using our services. [CLS] [SEP] this
includes:

  * when you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. [CLS] [SEP] to add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. [CLS] [SEP] some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered âspecialâ or âsensitiveâ in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. [CLS] [SEP] by choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as ios or android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request. [CLS] [SEP]
  * of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information we receive from others

in addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information
about you from others, including:

  * **other users** other users may provide information about you as they use our services. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **social media** you may be able to use your social media login (such as facebook login) to create and log into your tinder account. [CLS] [SEP] this saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **other partners** we may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where tinder ads are published on a partnerâs websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaignâs success). [CLS] [SEP]

#### information collected when you use our services

when you use our services, we collect information about which features
youâve used, how youâve used them and the devices you use to access our
services. [CLS] [SEP] see below for more details:

  * **usage information** we collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features youâve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive). [CLS] [SEP]
  * **device information** we collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:

    * hardware and software information such as ip address, device id and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising ids (such as googleâs aaid and apple's idfa, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your deviceâ settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., imei/udid and mac address);
    * information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;
    * information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **other information with your consent** if you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device youâre using, including gps, bluetooth or wi-fi connections. [CLS] [SEP] the collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you arenât using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. [CLS] [SEP] if you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services). [CLS] [SEP]

###  4\. [CLS] [SEP] cookies and other similar data collection technologies

we use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web
beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). [CLS] [SEP] you may read our
[cookie policy](/cookie-policy) for more information on why we use them (such
as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing
site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of
advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can
better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools. [CLS] [SEP]

some web browsers (including safari, internet explorer, firefox and chrome)
have a âdo not trackâ (â **dnt** â) feature that tells a website that
a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. [CLS] [SEP] if a website
that responds to a dnt signal receives a dnt signal, the browser can block
that website from collecting certain information about the browserâs user. [CLS] [SEP]
not all browsers offer a dnt option and dnt signals are not yet uniform. [CLS] [SEP] for
this reason, many businesses, including tinder, do not currently respond to
dnt signals. [CLS] [SEP]

###  5\. [CLS] [SEP] how we use information

the main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our
services. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide
you with advertising that may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] read on for a more
detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together
with practical examples. [CLS] [SEP]

#### to administer your account and provide our services to you

  * create and manage your account
  * provide you with customer support and respond to your requests
  * complete your transactions
  * communicate with you about our services, including order management and billing

#### to help you connect with other users

  * analyze your profile, activity on the service, and preferences to recommend meaningful connections to you and recommend you to others; for more information on our profiling and automated decision-making, please see our [faq](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/articles/360003082172-profiling-and-automated-decision-making-at-tinder)
  * show usersâ profiles to one another

#### to ensure a consistent experience across your devices

  * link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them. [CLS] [SEP] we do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full ip address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them. [CLS] [SEP]

#### to provide new tinder services to you

  * register you and display your profile on new tinder features and apps
  * administer your account on these new features and apps

#### to serve you relevant offers and ads

  * administer sweepstakes, contests, discounts or other offers
  * develop, display and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our services and other sites
  * communicate with you by email, phone, social media or mobile device about products or services that we think may interest you

#### to improve our services and develop new ones

  * administer focus groups and surveys
  * conduct research and analysis of usersâ behavior to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on usersâ behavior)
  * develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users). [CLS] [SEP]

#### to prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorized
activities

  * address ongoing or alleged misbehavior on and off-platform
  * perform data analysis to better understand and design countermeasures against these activities
  * retain data related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences

#### to ensure legal compliance

  * comply with legal requirements
  * assist law enforcement
  * enforce or exercise our rights, for example our terms

to process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal
bases:

  * _provide our service to you:_ most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _legitimate interests:_ we may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we analyze usersâ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _consent:_ from time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons. [CLS] [SEP] you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

###  6\. [CLS] [SEP] how we share information

since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of
usersâ information is, of course, with other users. [CLS] [SEP] we also share some
usersâ information with service providers and partners who assist us in
operating the services, with other match group companies and, in some cases,
legal authorities. [CLS] [SEP] read on for more details about how your information is
shared with others. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### with other users

you share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose
information on the service (including your public profile). [CLS] [SEP] please be careful
with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that
youâre comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can
control what others do with your information once you share it. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for
certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to
your settings. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### with our service providers and partners

we use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] these third
parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance,
analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and
security operations. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in
advertising our services. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we may share limited information on
you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners. [CLS] [SEP]

we follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or
working with any partner. [CLS] [SEP] all of our service providers and partners must agree
to strict confidentiality obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### with other match group businesses

tinder is part of the match group family of businesses which, as of the date
of this privacy policy, includes websites and apps such as tinder, okcupid,
plenty of fish, match, meetic, blackpeoplemeet, lovescout24, ourtime, pairs,
parperfeito, and twoo (for more details, click [here](https://mtch.com/)). [CLS] [SEP]

we share your information with other match group companies for them to assist
us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions
and on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] assistance provided by other match group companies may
include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance,
customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting
assistance, better understanding how our service is used and usersâ behavior
to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against
spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share information with other match group companies for legitimate
business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting
as well as compliance with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share user information
with other match group companies to remove users who violate our terms of
service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior. [CLS] [SEP] in
some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### for corporate transactions

we may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in
part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring,
reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or
control. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### when required by law

we may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a
legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government /
law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in
the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law);
or (iii) to protect the safety of any person. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### to enforce legal rights

we may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability
in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal
rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested
parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate,
prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or
other wrongdoing. [CLS] [SEP]

  * #### with your consent or at your request

we may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. [CLS] [SEP] in
any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by
itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general
demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as
well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of
the above circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] we may also share this information with other match
group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver
targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third
parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. [CLS] [SEP] we may combine this
information with additional non-personal information or personal information
in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. [CLS] [SEP] more
information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our
[cookie policy](/cookie-policy)

###  7\. [CLS] [SEP] cross-border data transfers

sharing of information laid out in section 6 sometimes involves cross-border
data transfers, for instance to the united states of america and other
jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP] as an example, where the service allows for users to be located
in the european economic area (âeeaâ), their personal information is
transferred to countries outside of the eea. [CLS] [SEP] we use standard contract clauses
approved by the european commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data
transfers from the eea to other countries. [CLS] [SEP] standard contractual clauses are
commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to
protect the privacy and security of your data

###  8\. [CLS] [SEP] your rights

we want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with
the following tools:

  * _access / update tools in the service._ tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and thatâs associated with your account directly within the service. [CLS] [SEP] if you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help [here.](https://gotinder.com/help)
  * _device permissions._ mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. [CLS] [SEP] you can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. [CLS] [SEP] of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _deletion._ you can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service. [CLS] [SEP]

we want you to be aware of your privacy rights. [CLS] [SEP] here are a few key points to
remember:

  * _reviewing your information._ applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). [CLS] [SEP] you can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request [here.](https://account.gotinder.com/data?locale=en)
  * _updating your information._ if you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us [here.](https://gotinder.com/help)

for your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to
provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. [CLS] [SEP]

keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the
request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual
property or the privacy of another user. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to receive information
relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him
or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our privacy
officer to provide their written consent before the information is released. [CLS] [SEP]

also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the
processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not
allow us to provide our service to you anymore. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we cannot
provide our service if we do not have your date of birth. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _uninstall._ you can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. [CLS] [SEP] if you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. [CLS] [SEP] if you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities. [CLS] [SEP]
  * _accountability._ in certain countries, including in the european union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established. [CLS] [SEP]

###  9\. [CLS] [SEP] residents of california

if you are a california resident, you can request a notice disclosing the
categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third
parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar
year. [CLS] [SEP] to request this notice, please submit your request
[here](https://gotinder.com/help). [CLS] [SEP] please allow 30 days for a response. [CLS] [SEP] for
your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to
provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request. [CLS] [SEP]

###  10\. [CLS] [SEP] how we protect your information

we work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration,
disclosure or destruction of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] as with all technology
companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not
promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always
remain secure. [CLS] [SEP]

we regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and
regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices
to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we
suspect or detect any breach of security. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that your account or
information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately
[here](https://gotinder.com/help)

in order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against
unauthorized access, theft and loss, we implemented a bug bounty program. [CLS] [SEP] for
more information about our bug bounty program, please click
[here.](https://hackerone.com/tinder)

###  11\. [CLS] [SEP] how long we retain your information

we keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate
business purposes (as laid out in section 5) and as permitted by applicable
law. [CLS] [SEP] to protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services,
we implement a safety retention window of three months following account
deletion. [CLS] [SEP] during this period, account information will be retained although
the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore. [CLS] [SEP]

in practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your
account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of
continuous inactivity, unless:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some âtraffic dataâ is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);
  2. [CLS] [SEP] we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our terms, privacy policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);
  3. [CLS] [SEP] there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
  4. [CLS] [SEP] the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. [CLS] [SEP] for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account. [CLS] [SEP]

keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data
deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that
