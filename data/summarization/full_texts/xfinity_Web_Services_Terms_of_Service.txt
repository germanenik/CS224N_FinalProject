# web services terms of service

### revised and effective: october 21, 2019

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] about the web services terms of service and comcast web services

within these web services terms of service (" **terms** ") the term "
**comcast** " or " **we** " (and related pronouns) will refer to comcast cable
communications management, llc, and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates
that own and operate websites and internet services on its behalf. [CLS] [SEP] the term "
**you** " (and related pronouns) refers to you as a user of comcast's websites
and internet services described below. [CLS] [SEP]

**note: these terms contain a binding arbitration provision in section 19 that
affects your rights under these terms with respect to all of the comcast web
services. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration provision requires that disputes be resolved in
individual binding arbitrations or small claims court proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] in
arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and
appellate review than in court.**

these terms set forth the terms and conditions through which comcast will
permit you to use these comcast-owned and operated websites and services:

  * comcast-branded websites and web services that link to these terms, such as: [comcast.net](http://my.xfinity.com/), [xfinity.com/stream](https://xfinity.com/stream/), [my.xfinity.com](http://my.xfinity.com/), [xfinityhomesecurity.com](http://www.xfinityhomesecurity.com/), and [internet.xfinity.com](https://internet.xfinity.com/), excluding certain co-branded websites and web services provided by third parties through contractual arrangements with comcast, as further described below ( (the **"comcast sites"** );

  * all mobile applications provided by comcast that link to these terms (such as xfinity stream, xfinity connect, and xfinity xfi ios and android applications) (the **"comcast apps"** ); and

  * xfinity wi-fi services, if you are not an xfinity subscriber or you are an xfinity subscriber but your subscription does not include access to xfinity wi-fi; and

  * a comcast-provided email address (such as yourname@comcast.net), if you are not an xfinity internet or xfinity voice subscriber (collectively, items (1) through (5) are referred to as the " **comcast web services **"). [CLS] [SEP]

your use of any xfinity - or comcast-branded - software provided in connection
with the comcast web services, including comcast apps and any devices provided
by comcast for use with those apps, are subject to the terms of the comcast
software license agreement at
[http://my.xfinity.com/terms/license/](/terms/license/) (the "comcast software
license"). [CLS] [SEP]

## what is outside the scope of these terms?

these terms **_do not apply_** to your use of any other products or services
provided by comcast such as xfinity tv, xfinity voice, xfinity internet,
xfinity home, or the xfinity stream app and xfinity.com/stream to deliver
xfinity tv when used within the residence at which you have an xfinity tv and
xfinity internet subscription. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribe to or use one or more of these
services (including using the comcast web services to place or receive xfinity
voice calls), you can see the terms that apply to the residential versions of
these services by visiting
<http://www.comcast.com/corporate/customers/policies/policies.html>. [CLS] [SEP]

some of the comcast web services contain links to other websites, including
websites of third parties who are acting on our behalf as our agents,
suppliers, or providers. [CLS] [SEP] these other websites are not operated by comcast and
have their own terms of service that you should read before you use them. [CLS] [SEP]
other sites that we link to may contain comcast branding or co-branding, but
these non-comcast websites and resources are provided by parties other than
comcast. [CLS] [SEP] examples of these non-comcast websites include websites where you are
required to log-in using a username and password other than your username and
password for the comcast web services, such as the "jobs" channel and the
"dating" channel on xfinity.com. [CLS] [SEP] these terms do not apply to those non-comcast
sites. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that comcast is not responsible for (i) the
availability of any of these non-comcast websites or resources, and does not
endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from
these websites or resources, and (ii) for any loss or damage which may be
incurred by you as a result of the availability of those websites or
resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness,
accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or
available from, these websites or resources. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] accepting the terms

in order for you to use any of the comcast web services, you must first accept
these terms and the comcast software license. [CLS] [SEP] you can accept these terms and
the comcast software license by:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] signing in or checking a box next to "by signing in, you agree to these terms of service and privacy policy" (or similar language); or

  2. [CLS] [SEP] using any of the comcast web services, in which case you understand and agree that these terms and the comcast software license will apply to your use of those services (or any parts of them) (the earlier of the dates you checked such box or first used the comcast web services, the " **effective date** "). [CLS] [SEP]

you may wish to print or save a local copy of the terms and the comcast
software license for your records. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] registration

in order to use certain comcast web services you may be required to provide
information about yourself (such as identification or contact details). [CLS] [SEP] you
agree that any registration information you give to comcast will be accurate,
complete, and current. [CLS] [SEP] you will notify comcast immediately of any changes to
any of the foregoing information. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for updating your email
address, so that if you use any of the account management features of the
comcast web services, such as online bill pay, comcast can send you notices
relating to these features, such as notice that your online bill has posted. [CLS] [SEP]
if your email address is not current, you will not receive online bill
postings; however, your payment due date will remain unchanged. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] law, order, or regulation;
  * post, store, send, transmit, or disseminate on the comcast web services any information or material which a reasonable person could deem to be unlawful;

  * collect responses from unsolicited bulk messages posted on or distributed through the comcast web services;
  * impersonate any person or entity, engage in sender address falsification, forge anyone else's digital or manual signature, or perform any other similar fraudulent activity (for example, "phishing") on the comcast web services;
  * restrict, inhibit, or otherwise interfere with the ability of any other person, regardless of intent, purpose or knowledge, to use or enjoy the comcast web services (except for tools for safety and security functions such as parental controls, for example), including, without limitation, posting or transmitting any information or software which contains a worm, virus, or other harmful feature, or generating levels of traffic sufficient to impede others' ability to use, send, or retrieve information;

  * engage in the systematic retrieval of data or other content from the comcast web services, except though apis or other interfaces specifically provided for this purpose, to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory, without comcast's prior written consent;
  * capture, rip, download, or otherwise create a copy of any content that is shown on the comcast web services without obtaining any required permission of the content owner;
  * take any actions for the purpose of manipulating or distorting, or that may undermine the integrity and accuracy of, any ratings or reviews of any movie or other entertainment program, service or product that may be presented by the comcast web services; or
  * attempt to or actually circumvent any method used by comcast to control access to comcast web services, including, but not limited to, spoofing or otherwise impersonating an ip address for your computer that is not actually assigned to your computer or setting up a proxy or other device that allows others to access the comcast web services through it. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an xfinity internet customer, you can find the guidelines for
acceptable use of the internet service, including any xfinity email or webmail
services, at
<http://www.comcast.com/corporate/customers/policies/policies.html>. [CLS] [SEP]

## 5\. [CLS] [SEP] your passwords and unauthorized use of your account

you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your comcast web
services account and its password(s). [CLS] [SEP] in addition you are responsible for
controlling access to any pcs, mobile devices, gateways, or other end points
that you allow to store your password, or on which you enable a "remember me"
or similar functionality (" **activated device** "). [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, you agree
that you will be solely responsible to comcast for all activities that occur
under your comcast web services accounts, including the activities of any
individual with whom you share your comcast web services account or an
activated device, and will be responsible for any breach of these terms caused
by these activities. [CLS] [SEP] if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your
password or of your account, you agree to notify comcast immediately. [CLS] [SEP] to
protect your privacy, comcast recommends logging out of the comcast web
services after each visit when you are using a public or shared pc, mobile
device, or other end point. [CLS] [SEP]

comcast does not permit credential sharing. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that comcast web
services account usernames and passwords associated with your account: (i)
shall be used only by you and members of your household whose primary
residential address is the same as the premises at which your comcast web
services account is located; (ii) shall not be shared with any user other than
members of your household for any reason (including, but not limited to, for
accessing any third party video services and platforms); and (iii) shall be
used only on devices used by you or a member of your household primarily at
the residential address location of the comcast web services account. [CLS] [SEP] you
agree you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of
all comcast web services account usernames and passwords associated with your
account, including those used by members of your household. [CLS] [SEP]

## 6\. [CLS] [SEP] privacy and your personal information

to understand how comcast collects and uses information through the comcast
web services, please read the web services privacy policy at
[http://my.xfinity.com/privacy/](/privacy/). [CLS] [SEP]

comcast is not responsible for any information provided by you to third
parties, and this information is not subject to the web services privacy
policy. [CLS] [SEP] you assume all privacy, security, and other risks associated with
providing any information, including personally identifiable information, to
third parties via the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] for a description of the privacy
protections associated with providing information to third parties, you should
refer to any privacy policies provided by those third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use any of the voice control features of the comcast web services, like
the voice control feature of the x1 remote app, all voice commands are sent to
comcast or its contracted service provider. [CLS] [SEP] comcast, and its provider, use
these voice commands to provide the voice control service (including quality
assurance, troubleshooting, and customer support), improve comcast's products
and services, and improve their voice recognition algorithms. [CLS] [SEP] if you use any
of the voice control features of the comcast web services, you consent to
comcast and its contracted service provider recording, storing, and using your
voice input as described herein. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand and agree that comcast (and its providers) may collect and use
technical and related information, including information about your computers
and/or mobile devices, operating systems, peripherals (such as gateways and
extenders), applications, connected devices, network traffic, location data,
and data use to deliver the comcast web services and for other purposes
including support and related services. [CLS] [SEP]

## 7\. [CLS] [SEP] content on the comcast web services

certain comcast web services allow you to access content and information, such
as collections of data, video, audio, or other multimedia, and photographs and
other static images (the " **content** "). [CLS] [SEP] this content may be owned by
comcast, other companies that give comcast the right to distribute their
content (like movie publishers), or users of the comcast web services (like
you). [CLS] [SEP] comcast grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to
view the content and to use the comcast web services for personal, non-
commercial purposes as set forth in these terms or in a manner that does not
require a license. [CLS] [SEP] except for activities that do not require a license, unless
the content was legally posted by you on the comcast web services, you may not
distribute copies of the content in any form (including by email or other
electronic means), without prior written permission from its owner. [CLS] [SEP] of course,
you are free to encourage others to access the content and to tell them how to
find it. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, our content providers want to remind you that you must not
remove, alter, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or
other proprietary notices marked on the content or any digital rights
management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control
measure associated with the content. [CLS] [SEP] the copying, downloading, stream
capturing, reproduction, duplication, archiving, distribution, uploading,
publication, modification, translation, broadcast, performance, display, sale,
or transmission of the content is strictly prohibited unless it is expressly
permitted by comcast in writing or is an activity that does not require a
license. [CLS] [SEP] you may not incorporate the content into any hardware or software
application. [CLS] [SEP] this prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the
derivative materials free of charge. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand that by using the comcast web services you may be exposed to
content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] in this
respect, you use the comcast web services at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like
to use them, there are commercially available services and software that can
limit exposure to material that you may find objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] the xfinity
internet service provides security information and tools for all users,
including parents, at <http://internetsecurity.xfinity.com/>. [CLS] [SEP] some of the
tools may require that you be a registered xfinity internet user in order to
download and use them. [CLS] [SEP] other tools may require that you purchase a separate
license to use them. [CLS] [SEP]

you understand that comcast has the right to change the comcast web services
at any time with or without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] we also may rearrange, delete, add
to, or otherwise change content or other features or functionality contained
within the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] if we do give you notice of these changes, it
may be provided on any of the comcast web sites, or via email, newspaper, bill
insert, or any other reasonable means of communication. [CLS] [SEP] if you find a change
in the comcast web services unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your
comcast web services account or to stop using the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP]
however, if you continue to use the comcast web services after the change,
this will constitute your acceptance of the change. [CLS] [SEP]

## 8\. [CLS] [SEP] user submissions

some of the material appearing on the comcast web services will be provided by
users or third parties. [CLS] [SEP] pursuant to section 230 of the federal communications
decency act, providers of interactive computer services are not considered or
treated as publishers or speakers of information that is provided by other
information content providers. [CLS] [SEP] comcast does not claim ownership of any
material that users submit or post on the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that
you are solely responsible for (and that comcast has no responsibility to you
or to any third party for) any material that you create, transmit, or display
while using the comcast web services, and for the consequences of your actions
(including any loss or damage which comcast may suffer) by doing so. [CLS] [SEP] further,
you agree that, with respect to any communication you submit to us for posting
on the comcast web services, you will not: (i) include any content that
violates a third party's copyright or other proprietary or privacy rights;
(ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations portrayed as fact; (iii) include
any advertising or solicitations; or (iv) submit any material that is
unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing,
hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be
considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law,
or is otherwise clearly inappropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

if you post any content to the comcast web services, you hereby grant comcast
and its licensees a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive right
and license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, modify,
sublicense, and distribute the content, on or in connection with the comcast
web services or the promotion of the comcast web services, and incorporate it
in other works, in whole or in part, in any manner. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant
that you own the content or otherwise have sufficient rights in it to grant to
comcast the license set forth in this section without infringing or violating
the rights of any third party. [CLS] [SEP] if you remove content that you have posted to
the comcast web services or terminate your comcast web services account, this
license will automatically expire, with a few limited exceptions. [CLS] [SEP] comcast may
retain copies of your content that were archived in the normal course of
comcast's systems operations. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, copies of content that you have
shared with other users of the comcast web services may be retained by comcast
and associated with those other users' accounts in order to provide them with
the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] comcast does not assert any ownership over content
that you post to the comcast web services; rather, as between us and you,
subject to the rights granted to us in these terms, you retain full ownership
of and/or licenses to all content you post to the comcast web services and any
intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with that
content. [CLS] [SEP]

the comcast web services may also contain links to community forums, bulletin
boards, chat rooms, and blogs about the various comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] children
under the age of 13 should not post in any of the forums, boards, chat rooms,
blogs, or other editorial sections of the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] participants
in these forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs are solely responsible
for all content that they post there. [CLS] [SEP] comcast retains the right, but not the
obligation, to correct any errors or omissions in any of this content, as it
may determine in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] comcast further reserves the right to
delete or remove any content from the forums or blogs without prior notice or
liability. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that your participation in these forums, bulletin boards,
chat rooms, and blogs will at all times conform to the posted comment policy
for that forum, bulletin board, chat room, or blog. [CLS] [SEP]

comcast reserves the right, but does not assume any obligation, to review any
user submission prior to its display on the comcast web services using
automated tools or manual processes. [CLS] [SEP] comcast may refuse to display or remove
any user submission from the comcast web services for any reason in our sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] however, we will typically only do so when we become aware that
the material in question is harmful, clearly illegal, or likely to be
considered highly offensive or objectionable to a large segment of our users. [CLS] [SEP]

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] feedback

comcast will receive any feedback you provide under the terms at
[http://my.xfinity.com/terms/feedback/](/terms/feedback/). [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] proprietary rights

you acknowledge and agree that comcast (or comcast's licensors) owns all legal
right, title, and interest in and to the comcast web services, including any
intellectual property rights which subsist in the comcast web services
(whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the
world those rights may exist). [CLS] [SEP]

nothing in the terms gives you a right to use any of comcast's trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand
features. [CLS] [SEP] if you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand
features in a separate written agreement with comcast, then you agree that
your use of these features shall comply with that agreement, any applicable
provisions of the terms, and comcast's brand feature use guidelines as updated
from time to time. [CLS] [SEP]

nothing in the terms gives you a right to use any trademark, service mark,
trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or
intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of these marks,
names or logos. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] linking to the comcast sites

comcast welcomes links to any of the comcast sites. [CLS] [SEP] you are free to establish
a hypertext link to these websites so long as the link does not state or imply
any affiliation, connection, endorsement, sponsorship, or approval of your
site by comcast. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] term; provisions that remain in effect after termination

the terms apply to all users of the comcast web services, and will be in
effect from the effective date until terminated by either comcast or you as
set forth below. [CLS] [SEP]

sections 8 through 10, 12 through 15, 19, and 20 of these terms will survive
termination, and shall continue to apply indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP]

## unregistered users

if you use any of the comcast web services (or parts of those services) that
are accessible without registration, you can simply discontinue use of those
services at any time. [CLS] [SEP] doing so will terminate the applicability of these terms
to you with respect to those services. [CLS] [SEP] if you breach any provision of these
terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, comcast reserves
the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your use any or all of the
comcast web services and terminate the terms. [CLS] [SEP] we may take these actions with
or without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] because unregistered users are generally unknown to
us, in most cases we will be unable to give notice of these actions. [CLS] [SEP]

## registered users

if you use any of the comcast web services (or parts of those services) as a
registered user, you may delete your registered user account at any time. [CLS] [SEP]
doing so will terminate these terms with respect to that comcast web service. [CLS] [SEP]
if you breach any provision of these terms or other applicable policies, or
for any other reason, comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or
terminate your registered user account for any or all of the comcast web
services and terminate the terms. [CLS] [SEP] we may take these actions with or without
notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] because registered users are known to us, however, we will
generally use reasonable efforts to give notice of these actions. [CLS] [SEP]

currently, registered user accounts for comcast.net and xfinity.com are
associated with xfinity tv, xfinity internet (including xfinity wi-fi), or
xfinity voice service and cannot be deleted without also terminating the
associated service. [CLS] [SEP]

## 13\. [CLS] [SEP] exclusion of warranties

because of the number of possible sources of information available through the
comcast web services, and the inherent hazards and uncertainties of electronic
distribution, there may be interruptions, delays, omissions, inaccuracies, or
other problems with this information. [CLS] [SEP] if you rely on the comcast web services
or any material available through them, you do so at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand and agree that the comcast web services are provided to you "as
is," "with all faults," and "as available." comcast and its agents and
licensors cannot and do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, usefulness,
timeliness, noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose of the information available through the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] comcast
and its agents and licensors cannot and do not warrant that the comcast web
services will continuously be available or free of errors, viruses, or other
harmful components. [CLS] [SEP] because some states do not permit the exclusion or
limitation of certain warranties, these exclusions and limitations of
warranties may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

## 14\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability

a. [CLS] [SEP] for purposes of this limitation of liability provision, “comcast” refers to
not only comcast cable communications management, llc but also its parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. [CLS] [SEP]

b. [CLS] [SEP] you waive the right to assert a claim against comcast more than twelve (12)
months after the first event or fact that gives rise to the claim. [CLS] [SEP]

c. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly provided in this agreement, in no event shall comcast
be liable to you or to any third party for any damages arising or resulting
from any interruption in or disruption to the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP] in no
event shall comcast be liable to you or to any third party for any indirect,
incidental, or consequential damages (including but not limited to lost data,
lost profits, or lost business opportunities), regardless of the legal theory,
regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable, and regardless of whether
comcast was advised of the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] in no event shall
comcast’s aggregate liability arising out of or relating to this agreement
exceed the greater of: (1) $2,500; or (2) three (3) times the aggregate
amounts paid or payable by you to comcast pursuant to this agreement in the
twelve (12) months preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. [CLS] [SEP]
notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations of liability in this paragraph
shall not apply to injuries: (1) to the body or person; or (2) caused by
comcast’s willful, malicious, reckless, or grossly negligent acts or
omissions. [CLS] [SEP]

d. [CLS] [SEP] these limitations of liability shall survive the termination of this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] because the law regarding limitations of liability varies by state,
these limitations of liability may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] notice to new jersey
consumers: these limitations of liability apply in new jersey. [CLS] [SEP]

## 15\. [CLS] [SEP] indemnification

you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless comcast (including its
parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates and all of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third-party
information providers) against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs
(including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any breach of the terms by
you or any individual with whom you share your comcast web services account or
an activated device. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, comcast will not seek
indemnification from you from any losses, expenses, claims, damages and costs,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from its own conduct. [CLS] [SEP] comcast
reserves the right, at its election, to assume the exclusive defense and
control of any matter subject to indemnification by you and you agree to
cooperate with comcast in connection with our defense. [CLS] [SEP]

## 16\. [CLS] [SEP] copyright infringement

comcast is committed to complying with u.s. [CLS] [SEP] copyright and related laws, and
requires all users of the comcast web services to comply with these laws. [CLS] [SEP]
accordingly, you may not use the comcast web services to store any material or
content, or disseminate any material or content, in any manner that
constitutes an infringement of third-party intellectual property rights,
including rights granted by u.s. [CLS] [SEP] copyright law. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are the owner of a copyrighted work and believe your rights under u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
copyright law have been infringed by any material on the comcast web services,
you may take advantage of certain provisions of the digital millennium
copyright act (the "dmca") by sending comcast's authorized agent a
notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the
dmca. [CLS] [SEP] upon comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement,
comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove
the allegedly infringing work(s) from the comcast web services or (ii) to
disable access to the work(s). [CLS] [SEP] in accordance with the dmca, it is comcast's
policy to reserve the right to terminate access to the comcast web services

## 19\. [CLS] [SEP] binding arbitration

**a. [CLS] [SEP] purpose.** if you are a user of or subscriber to xfinity tv, xfinity
voice, and/or xfinity internet, please refer to the binding arbitration
section of the comcast agreement for residential services, which applies to
any dispute (as defined in that agreement) between you and comcast for those
services, available here:
<http://www.comcast.com/corporate/customers/policies/policies.html>. [CLS] [SEP] if you
are not a subscriber to these services, any dispute (as defined below in these
terms) involving you and comcast shall be resolved through individual
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] in arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less
discovery and appellate review than in court. [CLS] [SEP] this section 19 (the
"arbitration provision") shall be broadly interpreted. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] definitions.** the term "dispute" means any claim or controversy related
to the comcast web services, including but not limited to any and all: (1)
claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort,
fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims
that arose before these terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise
after the expiration or termination of these terms; and (4) claims that are
the subject of purported class action litigation. [CLS] [SEP] as used in this arbitration
provision, "comcast" means comcast and any of its predecessors, successors,
assigns, parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and “you” means you and
any users or beneficiaries of your access to the comcast web services. [CLS] [SEP]
notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes relating to the scope, validity, or
enforceability of this arbitration provision will not be subject to
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]

**c. [CLS] [SEP] right to sue in small claims court.** notwithstanding anything in this
arbitration provision, either you or comcast may elect to bring an individual
action in small claims court if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of
any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the
jurisdiction of the small claims court. [CLS] [SEP]

**d. [CLS] [SEP] right to opt out.** if you do not wish to arbitrate disputes you may
decline to have your disputes with comcast arbitrated by notifying comcast in
writing within 30 days of the later of your first access to or use of the
comcast web services, or april 5, 2013, by visiting
[www.comcast.com/webarboptout](http://www.comcast.com/webarboptout), or by
mail to comcast 1701 john f. [CLS] [SEP] kennedy blvd., philadelphia, pa 19103-2838, attn:
legal department/arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] your written notification to comcast must
include your name, address and account number (if you are a comcast
subscriber) or telephone number (if you are not a comcast subscriber) as well
as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with comcast
through arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] your decision to opt out of this arbitration provision
will have no adverse effect on your relationship with comcast or services
provided by comcast. [CLS] [SEP] if you have previously opted out of arbitration with
comcast, you do not need to do so again. [CLS] [SEP]

**e. [CLS] [SEP] initiation of arbitration proceeding/selection of arbitrator.** the party
initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the american
arbitration association (“aaa”) by visiting its website
([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org)) or calling its toll free number
(1-800-778-7879). [CLS] [SEP] you may deliver any required or desired notice to comcast by
mail to comcast, 1701 jfk boulevard, philadelphia, pa 19103-2838 – attn: legal
department. [CLS] [SEP]

**f. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration procedures.** this arbitration provision shall be governed by
the federal arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP] arbitrations shall be administered by aaa
pursuant to its consumer arbitration rules (the “aaa rules”) as modified by
the version of this arbitration provision that is in effect when you notify
comcast about your dispute. [CLS] [SEP] you can obtain the aaa rules from the aaa by
visiting its website ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org)) or calling its toll-
free number (1-800-778-7879). [CLS] [SEP] if there is a conflict between this arbitration
provision and the rest of this agreement, this arbitration provision shall
govern. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the aaa
rules, this arbitration provision shall govern. [CLS] [SEP] if the aaa will not administer
a proceeding under this arbitration provision as written, the parties shall
agree on a substitute arbitration organization. [CLS] [SEP] if the parties cannot agree,
the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to
appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under
this arbitration provision as written applying the aaa consumer arbitration
rules. [CLS] [SEP] a single arbitrator will resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] unless you and comcast
agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location
convenient to you in the area where you receive or received any of the web
services from comcast; or, if you reside in a location outside of the area
where you receive or received any of the web services, then the arbitration
hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where
you reside. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law
and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and
other confidential or proprietary information. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall issue a
reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings
and conclusions. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the
arbitrator’s award. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall
not be entered in any court. [CLS] [SEP]

**g. [CLS] [SEP] waiver of class actions and collective relief.** there shall be no right
or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action,
joint or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a
purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public (such as a
private attorney general), other subscribers, or other persons. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party’s
claim. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a
party. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and
may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] this waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential
part of this arbitration provision and cannot be severed from it. [CLS] [SEP] the
remaining portions of this arbitration provision are not essential parts of
this arbitration provision and can be severed from it by a court of competent
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

**h. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration fees and costs.** if your claim seeks more than $75,000 in
the aggregate, the payment of the aaa’s fees and costs will be governed by the
aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] if your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment
of the aaa’s fees and costs will be comcast’s responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] however, if the
arbitrator finds that your dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper
purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil
procedure 11(b)), the payment of the aaa’s fees and costs shall be governed by
the aaa rules and you shall reimburse comcast for all fees and costs that were
your obligation to pay under the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] you may hire an attorney to
represent you in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and
additional costs and may only recover your attorneys’ fees and costs in the
arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is
decided in your favor. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding anything in this arbitration provision
to the contrary, comcast will pay all fees and costs that it is required by
law to pay. [CLS] [SEP]

**i. [CLS] [SEP] survival.** this arbitration provision will survive the termination or
expiration of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

## 20\. [CLS] [SEP] general legal terms

govern your use of the comcast web services, and completely replace any prior

[CLS] [SEP]

## 23\. [CLS] [SEP] special note about comcast email for users who are not xfinity
internet subscribers. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are not a subscriber to our residential xfinity internet or xfinity

address such as yourname@comcast.net (" **email service** "):

## modifications, suspension, and termination

you understand that comcast may modify or discontinue the email service at any
time with or without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] if we do give you notice, it may be

forms of communications in violation of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] as described in section
iii of our acceptable use for xfinity internet policy, comcast uses reasonable
network management tools and techniques to protect customers from receiving
spam and from sending spam (often without their knowledge over an infected
computer). [CLS] [SEP] comcast's anti-spam approach is explained in the faqs under the

[here](http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/reducing-spam-
email/). [CLS] [SEP]

comcast is not responsible for deleting or forwarding any email sent to the
wrong email address by you or by someone else trying to send email to you. [CLS] [SEP]
comcast is also not responsible for forwarding email sent to any email service
account that has been suspended or terminated. [CLS] [SEP] this email will be returned to
the sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily at comcast's sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel or terminate your email service account for any
reason, all email associated with that account (and any secondary accounts)
will be permanently deleted as well. [CLS] [SEP]

if comcast believes in its sole discretion that any subscriber name, account
name, or email address (collectively, an " **identifier** ") on the email
service may be used for, or is being used for, any misleading, fraudulent, or
other improper or illegal purpose, comcast (i) reserves the right to block
access to and prevent the use of any of these identifiers and (ii) may at any
time require any customer to change his or her identifier. [CLS] [SEP] in addition,
comcast may at any time reserve any identifiers on the email service for its
own purposes. [CLS] [SEP]
