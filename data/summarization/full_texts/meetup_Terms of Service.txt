#  terms of service

[back to meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)

## terms of service overview

below is an overview of our terms of service for our “platform”, which means
any website, application, or service we offer. [CLS] [SEP] you should read the complete
terms of service because that document (and not this overview) is our legally
binding agreement. [CLS] [SEP]  ** _the terms of service includes information about your
legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals,
limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration
rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver._**

### your relationship with meetup

  * by using our platform, you are agreeing to our terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] the terms of service are a legally binding agreement between you and meetup. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you break the rules, we may suspend or terminate your account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we charge for certain aspects of our platform, and some of these fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription). [CLS] [SEP]

### meetup groups, organizers and members

  * organizers may establish membership criteria for their own meetup groups. [CLS] [SEP] while there is probably a meetup group out there for everyone, not every meetup group is for you. [CLS] [SEP] if you can’t find the right group, you can easily [start your own meetup group](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882111). [CLS] [SEP]
  * organizers may charge fees for memberships or events. [CLS] [SEP]
  * using our platform involves meeting real people and doing real things in the real world, which can sometimes lead to unexpected situations. [CLS] [SEP] we can’t control what happens in the real world, and we are not responsible for it. [CLS] [SEP] you should use common sense and good judgment when interacting with others. [CLS] [SEP]

### your content and content of others

  * you are responsible for your “content”, which means any information, material, or other content posted to our platform. [CLS] [SEP] your content must comply with our terms of service, which includes the [usage and content policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897532), [groups and events policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712), [organizer and leadership standards](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913291), [member restrictions](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913271), [payment policies](https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/), [trademark usage guidelines](/hc/articles/360001655932-meetup-trademark-guidelines), and [api license terms](https://help.meetup.com/hc/articles/360028705532). [CLS] [SEP] your content is also subject to our [intellectual property dispute policies](/hc/articles/360001674451-intellectual-property-dispute-policies). [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not own the content that you post. [CLS] [SEP] however, we do require that you provide us a license to use this content in order for us to operate, improve, promote, and protect meetup and our platform for the benefit of you and others. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we are not responsible for content that members post or the communications that members send using our platform. [CLS] [SEP] we generally don’t review content before it’s posted. [CLS] [SEP] if you see content that violates our terms of service, you may [report inappropriate content](/hc/articles/360001673551-report-spam-or-inappropriate-content) to us. [CLS] [SEP]

### our platform

  * we try hard to make sure that our platform is always available and working, but we cannot guarantee it will be. [CLS] [SEP] occasionally things may not go exactly as planned. [CLS] [SEP] we apologize in advance for any inconvenience. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we are continually improving our platform. [CLS] [SEP] this means that we may modify or discontinue portions of our platform. [CLS] [SEP]
  * by using our platform, you agree to the limitations of liability and release in our terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to resolve any disputes you may have with us in the manner described in the terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] unless you are based in the european union, you agree to mandatory arbitration and waive your right to seek relief from a judge or jury in a court of law. [CLS] [SEP] claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may be based in a country where the laws that apply provide for different or additional rights and obligations. [CLS] [SEP] these terms of service will point out areas of difference. [CLS] [SEP]

## terms of service

last updated: 6/1/19  
(view previous version: [3/28/17](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360027578772))

our terms of service contain important information about your legal rights. [CLS] [SEP] to
make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these
gray boxes. [CLS] [SEP] these summaries are not part of the official terms, and it is
important for you to read the language in each section carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

### 1\. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement

**summary:  **you agree to follow some basic rules when using meetup’s
platform. [CLS] [SEP] these rules are described in these terms of service, including the
related policies and guidelines discussed below. [CLS] [SEP] we may change these rules. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.1 the agreement.** meetup enables you and other members to arrange
offline, real-world meetup groups and meetup events. [CLS] [SEP] the terms “meetup,” “we,”
“us,” and “our” include meetup, inc. [CLS] [SEP] and our corporate parent, affiliates, or
subsidiaries. [CLS] [SEP] we use the terms “you” and “your” to mean any person using our
platform, and any organization or person using the platform on an
organization’s behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we use the word “platform” to mean any website,
application, or service offered by meetup, including content we offer and
electronic communications we send. [CLS] [SEP] we provide our platform to you subject to
these terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] we use the terms “terms of service” and “agreement”
interchangeably to mean this document together with our [usage and content
policies](/hc/en-us/articles/360002897532), [groups and events
policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712), [organizer
and leadership standards](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360002913291), [member
restrictions](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913271),
[payment policies](https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/), [trademark usage
guidelines](/hc/articles/360001655932-meetup-trademark-guidelines), and [api
license terms](https://help.meetup.com/hc/articles/360028705532). [CLS] [SEP] your use of
the platform signifies that you agree to this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using the
platform for an organization, you agree to this agreement on behalf of that
organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to
the terms contained in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not or are unable to agree to
this agreement, do not use our platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** we have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some
legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries
and tips are for your convenience only and do not have a legal effect. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** these terms of service are an agreement between you and meetup and
not between you and any other member. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, see our [faq page
explaining the parties to our terms of service](/hc/articles/360002860032-is-
the-terms-of-service-an-agreement-between-organizers-and-members). [CLS] [SEP]

**1.2 revisions to this agreement.** we may modify this agreement from time to
time. [CLS] [SEP] when we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current
version and revising the date at the top of this page. [CLS] [SEP] if we make any material
change to this agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by
sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] by
continuing to use the platform after any changes come into effect, you agree
to the revised agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to accept the revised agreement,
you can close your account. [CLS] [SEP]

### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] your account and membership

**summary:** you need to be at least 18 years old to use our platform. [CLS] [SEP] meetup
organizers control the content and membership of their meetup groups. [CLS] [SEP] however,
we may remove any content you post or terminate your account at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.1 eligibility.** our platform is available to anyone who is at least 18
years old. [CLS] [SEP] you represent that you are at least 18. [CLS] [SEP] additional eligibility
requirements for a particular portion of our platform may be set by any member
who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our platform. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, the eligibility requirements for a meetup group or meetup event may
be set by the organizers of that group. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2 modification, suspension, and termination of your account.** we may
modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the platform if, in
our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this agreement,
including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this agreement,
that it is in the best interest of the meetup community, or to protect our
brand or platform. [CLS] [SEP] when this happens, we will notify you of the reasons for
the modification, suspension, or termination. [CLS] [SEP] we also may remove accounts of
members who are inactive for an extended period of time. [CLS] [SEP] please email
policy@meetup.com if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination
has occurred in error. [CLS] [SEP]

a member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our
platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify,
suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.3 account information and security.** when you register, you provide us
with some basic information, including an email address and a password. [CLS] [SEP] keep
your email address and other account information current and accurate. [CLS] [SEP] also,
you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or
else we may need to disable your account). [CLS] [SEP] we strongly encourage you to choose
a strong and unique password that is not shared with any other account or
online service and practice other healthy password security habits to help
avoid unauthorized access to your account. [CLS] [SEP] you alone are responsible for
anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and
confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. [CLS] [SEP] if
someone is using your password or accessing your account without your
permission, email us at abuse@meetup.com. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.4 license to the meetup platform and services**. [CLS] [SEP] subject to your
compliance with this agreement, meetup grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the platform in
order to access and use the services and features that we make available to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

### 3\. [CLS] [SEP] fees, payments, and offers

**summary:** we charge for certain features on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] if you’re a
meetup group organizer, you’re responsible for paying for organizer
subscription fees related to your meetup group. [CLS] [SEP] these fees are billed on a
regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your
subscription), and may change in the future. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, some organizers
charge money for participation in a meetup group or meetup event. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.1 fees charged by meetup.** use of some of the features on our platform is
free, and we charge fees for other features. [CLS] [SEP] we may in the future implement a
new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of
our platform. [CLS] [SEP] if we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you notice
in advance such as by posting changes on our platform or sending you an email. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of
the applicable service. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions
are in u.s. [CLS] [SEP] dollars. [CLS] [SEP] organizer subscriptions are non-transferable. [CLS] [SEP] members
based in the european union may cancel with a full refund within 14 days after
signing up to our platform. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you use the service, you may be
charged for services provided during this 14-day period. [CLS] [SEP] please note that this
14-day period begins when the service starts even if you are using a free
trial. [CLS] [SEP] users based in the european union can exercise their cancellation right
by emailing us at policy@meetup.com. [CLS] [SEP] see the [model cancellation form
here](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/7/highres_482807191.jpeg). [CLS] [SEP]

**3.2 fees charged by organizers.** organizers may impose fees related to
particular portions of the platform, such as member dues for a meetup group or
an event fee for a meetup event. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the right to initiate refunds of
fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through
a third-party payment service. [CLS] [SEP] refunds that we initiate, if any, will be
governed by our [payment policies](https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/). [CLS] [SEP]
organizers may also have their own refund policies, so long as they are
consistent with and do not limit members’ ability to receive refunds under our
[payment policies](https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/). [CLS] [SEP] payments made to
organizers via the platform are made through a third-party payment service
provider. [CLS] [SEP] if a member pays a fee to an organizer via the platform, the member
authorizes the organizer (and the organizer’s applicable payment service
provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the
fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges. [CLS] [SEP] certain types of fees
charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis. [CLS] [SEP] if billed on a
recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to
the designated payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may cancel auto-renewal at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** you should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to
any organizer. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they
promise or as you expect. [CLS] [SEP] you should check the refund policy of the meetup
group before making any payments to an organizer. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.3 payments to meetup.** organizers are responsible for paying subscription
and any other applicable fees to meetup on time and through our approved
payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] organizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse
are subject to removal as the organizer of the meetup groups associated with
their account, and their meetup group (along with all of the information and
content associated with or posted to that meetup group) may be terminated or
transferred to another member. [CLS] [SEP] you may only pay organizer fees to meetup using
a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the platform. [CLS] [SEP] if we
terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of
this agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees
paid to meetup. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you paid your organizer fees through the
meetup app for ios, your payment is subject to the [apple media services
terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html) and
conditions, and you will need to submit your request for a refund to apple. [CLS] [SEP]  

you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method
you designate via the platform. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize us (and our designated third-
party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the
total amount of any fees you owe to meetup, including any applicable taxes and
other charges. [CLS] [SEP] if the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is
otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled. [CLS] [SEP] we
reserve the right to adjust, or to instruct our payment processors to make
adjustments to a payment that has already been requested or received, in order
to correct errors or mistakes, or to issue refunds, in accordance with our
payment policies. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** to learn more about organizer subscriptions and what happens if they
expire, see this [faq on expired plans](/hc/articles/360002883171-what-if-my-
organizer-subscription-expires). [CLS] [SEP]

**3.4 automatic subscription renewals.** fees for certain aspects of our
platform may be billed on either a recurring basis or on a one-time basis. [CLS] [SEP] if
billed on a recurring basis, the fees are payable in advance of the applicable
period specified via the platform with no refunds. [CLS] [SEP] we will automatically bill
you for each renewal period until cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] by purchasing any feature or
other aspect of our platform for which we charge, you authorize us to keep
your payment current by charging the applicable fee to your credit card
account (or any other means of payment used by you). [CLS] [SEP] while you may cancel
auto-renewal or cancel your subscription at any time, refunds will be issued
solely pursuant to our [subscription refund
policy](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882931-meetup-
subscription-refund-policy). [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** to cancel your organizer subscription, see this [faq on modifying
subscriptions](/hc/articles/360002883151-how-do-i-cancel-my-organizer-
subscription). [CLS] [SEP]

**3.5 free trials.** we may offer free trials of subscriptions and other
products on our platform. [CLS] [SEP] we will inform you of the length of the free trial,
your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment. [CLS] [SEP] after your
free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically
bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. [CLS] [SEP] you can cancel automatic
subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures
described above. [CLS] [SEP] users based in the european union are entitled to cancel with
a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our platform by emailing us
at policy@meetup.com. [CLS] [SEP] see the [model cancellation form
here](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/7/highres_482807191.jpeg). [CLS] [SEP]
please note that this 14-day period begins when the free trial starts. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.6 third party payment processors.** an organizer that uses the platform to
accept payments from other members must comply with the terms and conditions
of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive
the payment. [CLS] [SEP] meetup does not provide those payment services, is not a party to
your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be
liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services. [CLS] [SEP]

**3.7 invoices from third parties.** in line with the tax laws of the country
where an organizer is using the platform, an organizer may receive meetup
invoices from a third party provider. [CLS] [SEP] such third party provider invoicing does
not in any way impact the rights and obligations agreed to in this agreement,
nor does it impact the fee being charged for the use of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

### 4\. [CLS] [SEP] your content and privacy

**summary:** you are responsible for the content you post on our platform or
send to us. [CLS] [SEP] you give us a license to use this content to operate, improve,
promote, and protect meetup and our platform. [CLS] [SEP] our [privacy
policy](https://www.meetup.com/privacy/) explains how we collect and use
information you provide about yourself and the information that may be
associated with you, and explains the limited ways we may share this
information. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.1 your content.** you are responsible for the content that you post to the
platform or otherwise provide to meetup. [CLS] [SEP] we use the word “content” to mean the
information, material, and any other content that you post to the platform or
otherwise send to us. [CLS] [SEP] examples of your content include:

  * the material that organizers and members typically post to the platform, such as information about meetup groups and meetup events, comments, and photos;
  * all feedback, suggestions, and other communications that you send or direct to meetup. [CLS] [SEP]

by being responsible for your content, you agree, among other things, that:

  * you have all the permissions, rights, and licenses needed (including under copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights) to provide the content to the platform and to meetup; 
  * your content does not include personal, private or confidential information belonging to others; and
  * your content does not otherwise violate the rights of any individual or entity. [CLS] [SEP]

you also agree that you and your content comply with this agreement, including
our [usage and content policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360002897532), [groups and events
policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712), [organizer
and leadership standards](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360002913291), [member
restrictions](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913271),
[intellectual property policies](/hc/articles/360001674451-intellectual-
property-dispute-policies), [trademark usage
guidelines](/hc/articles/360001655932-meetup-trademark-guidelines), and [api
license terms](https://help.meetup.com/hc/articles/360028705532). [CLS] [SEP] you also
agree that we may remove the metadata associated with your content. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** search engines can see public areas of the platform. [CLS] [SEP] your content
within these areas, such as the name and location that you provide during
registration, and your membership in public meetup groups, may appear in
search results. [CLS] [SEP] our platform is designed so that search engines cannot see
your content that is within restricted areas of the platform, such as private
meetup groups. [CLS] [SEP] you can find additional information on our [faq about search
engine visibility](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001674271). [CLS] [SEP]

**4.2 content license from you.** we do not claim ownership of your content. [CLS] [SEP]
however, to enable us to operate, improve, promote, and protect meetup and our
platform, and to ensure we do not violate any rights you may have in your
content, you hereby grant meetup a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license
(including a waiver of any moral rights) to use, host, store, reproduce,
modify, publish, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and create
derivative works of, your content and to commercialize and exploit the
copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights you have in your content. [CLS] [SEP]
this license would permit your content to remain on the platform, even after
you cease to be a member of a meetup group or of the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** this license doesn’t give us ownership of any of your content. [CLS] [SEP] it
simply gives us and members the right to use it on or related to the platform. [CLS] [SEP]
this license continues even if you close your account, because it’s necessary
for us to operate the platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.3 privacy.** meetup collects registration and other information about you
through our platform. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to our [privacy
policy](https://www.meetup.com/privacy/) and [cookie
policy](https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/) for details on how we collect,
use, and disclose this information. [CLS] [SEP] these policies do not govern use of
information that you provide to third parties, such as to organizers and other
members of meetup’s platform. [CLS] [SEP]

**tip:** meetup has no control over how other members may use information that
you provide to them, so you should exercise common sense and good judgment
when sharing information with others on our platform. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] your use of our platform

**summary:** we require that you follow our policies and guidelines when using
our platform. [CLS] [SEP] we have no responsibility for content that anyone posts to our
platform. [CLS] [SEP]

events policies](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712),
[organizer and leadership standards](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-

claim or $100, whichever is greater. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.1 warranty disclaimer.** our platform is provided to you “as is” and on an
“as available” basis. [CLS] [SEP] to the full extent permitted by applicable law, we
disclaim all warranties and conditions of any kind, including but not limited
to statutory warranties, and the implied warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP] we also disclaim any
warranties regarding (a) the reliability, timeliness, accuracy, and
performance of our platform, (b) any information, advice, services, or goods
obtained through or advertised on our platform or by us, as well as for any
information or advice received through any links to other websites or

circumstance is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount of fees, if any,
you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action that may give rise to
liability. [CLS] [SEP] the limitations set forth above in this section 8 will not limit or
exclude liability for our gross negligence, fraud, or intentional, malicious,
or reckless misconduct. [CLS] [SEP] some laws do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
liability, so these limits may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a member based in
the eu, you have legal remedies if we cause you loss by our breach or non-
performance of our legal obligations, or by our negligence, and these terms do
not affect those statutory remedies. [CLS] [SEP]

### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution

**summary:** if you have a dispute with meetup, you agree to try to work it
out directly with us first. [CLS] [SEP] if we can’t work it out, with limited exceptions,
you must submit any dispute with us to a neutral arbitrator instead of taking
the claim to a court of law. [CLS] [SEP] claims can only be brought individually, and not
as part of a class action. [CLS] [SEP] members based in the european union may have
additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] meetup has no
obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other members,
although we may try to facilitate a resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.1 informal resolution.** before making any claim, you and meetup agree to
try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. [CLS] [SEP] we use the term
“claim” in this section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to your use of our platform or this agreement, including
your participation in meetup events. [CLS] [SEP] you or meetup may initiate this process
by sending written notice according to section 11.2 describing the dispute and
your proposed resolution. [CLS] [SEP] in the event that we cannot resolve the issue within
30 business days following receipt of the initial notice, you or meetup may
bring a claim in accordance with this section 9. [CLS] [SEP] members based in the european
union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.2 arbitration agreement.** the arbitration procedures described in this
section 9.2 applies to all members, except for members who are based in the
european union. [CLS] [SEP] section 9.6 sets out the dispute resolution procedures that
apply to members who are based in the european union. [CLS] [SEP]

**a. [CLS] [SEP] mandatory arbitration.** except as set forth in section 9.3, you agree to
submit any claim to jams, inc., or its successor (“jams”) for final and
binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] in arbitration, certain rights that you or we would have
in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal. [CLS] [SEP] you and meetup are
each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises
during or after any termination of this agreement or your relationship with
meetup. [CLS] [SEP]

**b. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration time for filing.** any claim subject to arbitration must be
filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows
or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or

**c. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration procedures.** either party may commence arbitration by filing
a written demand for arbitration with jams, with a copy to the other party
according to the notice procedures in section 11.2. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be
conducted in accordance with [jams streamlined arbitration rules and
procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and any
other applicable rules that jams requires (“jams rules”) that are in effect as
of the demand for arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal arbitration act
and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these
arbitration provisions. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration hearings will take place in new york
county, new york or elsewhere as required by jams rules. [CLS] [SEP] your responsibility
to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set
forth in the jams rules. [CLS] [SEP] the parties will cooperate with jams and each other
in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator
from the appropriate jams list with substantial experience in resolving
intellectual property and contract disputes. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall follow this
agreement and, to the extent permitted by jams rules, can award costs, fees,
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing party, except that
the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting
anyone but the parties to the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award rendered by
such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.3 exceptions.** you or meetup may assert claims, if they qualify, in small
claims court in new york county, new york or any u.s. [CLS] [SEP] county where you live or
work. [CLS] [SEP] you or meetup may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction in new york county, new york as necessary to protect the
intellectual property rights of you or meetup pending the completion of
arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] meetup may take action in court or arbitration to collect any
fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to,
platform operations, or unauthorized use of our platform or intellectual
property. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this section 9 shall diminish meetup’s right to modify,
suspend or terminate your account or access to our platform under section 2.2. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.4 arbitration opt out.** **you may decline to resolve disputes through
arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@meetup.com within 30 days of
the date you first agree to this agreement.**  your email must include your
full name, residential address, the email address registered to your meetup
account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if you
opt out according to this process, then section 9.2 of this agreement does not
apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] this opt-out does not affect any other sections of this
agreement, such as sections 9.3 (exceptions), 9.5 (class action waiver), 11.5
(governing law), 11.6 (judicial forum), and 11.7 (time for filing). [CLS] [SEP]

**9.5 class action waiver.** you agree to resolve disputes with meetup on an
individual basis. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class
member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. [CLS] [SEP]  **you are
expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class
arbitrations, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other
arbitrations.**

**9.6 dispute resolution terms applicable to members based in the eu.** if you
are a member based in the european union, the mandatory provisions of the law
of the country in which you are resident will apply. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this agreement
will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions of
the local law that applies. [CLS] [SEP] if you are based in the european union, the local
laws in your european union member state may allow you to take legal action
against meetup in your member state and to invoke certain local laws against
meetup. [CLS] [SEP] the european commission provides for an [online dispute resolution
