**1\. [CLS] [SEP] you are in control of your personal data with your profile passport**

you to take full control over the personal data you provide us and share on
our platform. [CLS] [SEP] we guarantee that your personal data will not be sold to any

if you wish to extract your personal data, seats2meet.com can provide you with
this data in a generic/simple exchange format upon a request at
[privacy@seats2meet.com](mailto:privacy@seats2meet.com). [CLS] [SEP]  

**2\. [CLS] [SEP] which personal data we collect, when, why and for how long**  
at seats2meet.com we process your bookings for meetingspaces and workspaces
and seek to facilitate serendipitous exchanges between you and the other users
of our services and visitors of our locations. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect personal data during the following interactions:

  * when you visit our webpages and you are **not logged** in: we collect anonymous usage statistics that help us to monitor the platform. [CLS] [SEP] we use google analytics cookies to do so, but these are not relatable to natural persons and therefore don’t require your consent. [CLS] [SEP] please see below under 8 and our cookie statement for more information. [CLS] [SEP] we do so to continue improvement and development of our platform. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when you **create bookings on our platform** : based on our contract, your meetingspace and workspace booking and billing details that are needed to fulfil your booking request are stored in your profile passport until you delete your account, or two years after your last activity.

[CLS] [SEP] this information is also stored until you delete your account or two years after your last activity. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to object to our profiling activities. [CLS] [SEP] this may mean that you cannot longer use our service since this way of profiling is part of the actual service. [CLS] [SEP] please contact our data protection officer (privacy@seats2meet.com) if you wish to do so. [CLS] [SEP]
  * after **logging in with your profile passport** : we work with **google analytics** to monitor individual navigation behaviour on our platform to adequately understand how our services are being used. [CLS] [SEP] more specific information about this is given below under 8. [CLS] [SEP] we do so to continue improvement and development of our platform. [CLS] [SEP]
