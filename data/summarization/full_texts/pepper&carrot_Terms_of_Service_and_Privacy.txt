# terms of service and privacy

this document was added to the website in may 2018 in order to assure
compliance with the [general data protection
regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_data_protection_regulation);
a regulation in the european union on data protection and privacy for all
individuals within the european union (eu) and the european economic area
(eea). [CLS] [SEP]

the websites <https://www.peppercarrot.com/> and <http://www.davidrevoy.com/>
are hosted in france and subject to this regulation. [CLS] [SEP]

## who we are

my name is david revoy, founder/author/artist of pepper&carrot and i own the
websites published at the addresses <https://www.peppercarrot.com/> and
<http://www.davidrevoy.com/>. [CLS] [SEP] the sources of <https://www.peppercarrot.com/>
are available at <https://framagit.org/peppercarrot/website> and distributed
under the
[gpl3](https://framagit.org/peppercarrot/website/blob/master/license). [CLS] [SEP] the
data (comments, avatars etc.) are not in this repository, it only contains
this website's the "engine". [CLS] [SEP]

the contributors to the project are listed at
<https://framagit.org/peppercarrot/webcomics/blob/master/authors.md>. [CLS] [SEP] most of
them have the ability to modify the source code of the artworks, translations
and engine of the websites i put online, but they do not have access to the
data that's collected (comment system: email, name, (cat)avatar(generated),
ip; log of the website). [CLS] [SEP]

therefore, i, david revoy, am the only responsible for managing your data
collected on the mentioned websites (except about "embedded content from other
websites", see below). [CLS] [SEP]

you can contact me at [info@davidrevoy.com](mailto:info@davidrevoy.com) to
discuss any issue in relation to your data displayed on the websites. [CLS] [SEP]

## what personal data we collect, why we collect it, and how long we retain it

### comments

when visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the
comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s ip address. [CLS] [SEP] we also generate a catavatar
picture from the name of the commenter and keep the picture on a cached
folder. [CLS] [SEP]

if you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP] this is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments
automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. [CLS] [SEP] removing a
comment or editing is not possible for the user via the web interface because
the engine of the website pluxml doesn't allow it. [CLS] [SEP] in case you want the
modification or deletion of a comment, please just add another comment from
the same machine (so i can see your ip, this prevents having someone else
wanting to edit or delete your message) and ask david revoy to edit or remove
your comment. [CLS] [SEP] i'll do it manually as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

### cookies

we use only store cookies on your webbrowser to let your webbrowser remember
your last selected language, and a session id represented by a hash to allow
continuity in the page you browse on the website. [CLS] [SEP] the session id expires in
less than 24 hours, after that a new one is generated. [CLS] [SEP] the language cookie
labeled with plxmymultilingue keeps around for a month. [CLS] [SEP] you can check yourself
the content by entering this address on the firefox browser:
chrome://browser/content/preferences/cookies.xul, then filter the website by
entering `peppercarrot`. [CLS] [SEP] navigating the website without cookies is not a
problem; it will just fall back to the detected language (the one declared by
your web browser). [CLS] [SEP] the comment system doesn't remember your name. [CLS] [SEP] if the field
to enter a comment already proposes a name or an email, it is done by your web
browser. [CLS] [SEP]

### embedded content from other websites

articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] videos, images,
articles, etc.). [CLS] [SEP] embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact
same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. [CLS] [SEP] these websites may
collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing
your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are
logged in to that website. [CLS] [SEP] (eg. [CLS] [SEP] embeding a youtube video player ). [CLS] [SEP]

### analytics

i don't use analytic services, so i can't share the visitor statistics with
anyone (i don't use google analytics or other scripts to track you). [CLS] [SEP] i don't
do any automated decision making and/or profiling on the user data. [CLS] [SEP] the
hosting company of the website [ovh](https://www.ovh.com) and domain-name
registrar [gandi](http://www.gandi.net) own respectively the machine where the
website is hosted and its internet address. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, these companies might
log your access to the site. [CLS] [SEP]

### how i protect your data

the data (email, name, avatar, ip when you leave a comment; the log of the
website) are protected and the files can be accessed only via ftp/ssh with
code access of the server. [CLS] [SEP] i am the only person with this access right now. [CLS] [SEP] it
is not possible to access this folder via public access. [CLS] [SEP]

### what data breach/moderation procedures we have in place

as i don't collect any sensible information about our visitors (only ip and
optional email for the comment system) a big hack of our database couldn't
affect really our end-user. [CLS] [SEP] in the worst case, a hacker could discover your
email address, or duplicate your comment. [CLS] [SEP] no password can be stolen as no
password will ever be asked for leaving a comment on www.peppercarrot or
davidrevoy.com. [CLS] [SEP] in case of getting evidence of impersonation through the
comments, or modification of the content of your comment by someone else; i'll
moderate the comment. [CLS] [SEP]

thank you for reading. [CLS] [SEP]
