## **introduction and contents**

this is the privacy policy for guardian news & media limited (“ guardian”),
our sites such as theguardian.com (“our sites”), and our associated apps. [CLS] [SEP] some
of our other sites and services have their own policies, which will be
relevant to you when you are using those sites and services. [CLS] [SEP]

our [values](https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2015/sep/22/living-our-
values-facts-guardian) guide everything that we do – including our editorial
approach and how we use personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we are strongly committed to keeping
your personal data safe. [CLS] [SEP] this commitment exists throughout the lifecycle of
your personal data, from the design of any guardian service which uses
personal data to the deletion of that data. [CLS] [SEP]

to compliment our global approach to privacy protection, this policy also
incorporates specific information privacy rights granted to individuals under
californian and australian privacy law. [CLS] [SEP] this reflects our relationship with
our readers in these locations where we provide localised editions of our
editorial content. [CLS] [SEP]

we think carefully about our use of personal data, and below you can find the
details of what we do to protect your privacy. [CLS] [SEP] this policy covers, among other
topics:

  * information about your rights, the choices available to you, and our obligations in the european union, in california, in australia, and elsewhere

  * transparency about how we collect and use your personal data, including when and how it is shared

  * information on how we protect your personal data

  * information on how we will facilitate your rights and respond to your questions

find out more about how we manage your personal data below:

## **about this privacy policy**

this privacy policy explains how we collect, use, share, transfer, and sell
(for california residents) your personal data when you use the services
provided on our sites and our apps or interact with us; and your data privacy
rights. [CLS] [SEP] this includes subscriptions, vouchers and contributions. [CLS] [SEP]

personal data is any information about you by which you can be identified or
be identifiable. [CLS] [SEP] this can include information such as:

  * your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, phone number, mobile number, financial details, such as payment cards you use to purchase products, subscriptions or support our journalism

  * information about your device (such as the ip address, which is a numerical code to identify your device that can provide information about the country, region or city where you are based)

  * information relating to how you use and interact with our sites, apps and services

when we refer to “personal data” in this policy, we are also referencing
“personal information,” as it is defined under california law, which you can
read more about [here](https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy#nav15),
and as it is defined under australian law, which you can read about
[here](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles-
guidelines/chapter-b-key-concepts/). [CLS] [SEP]

some of our other sites provide additional privacy information. [CLS] [SEP] you can read
that information using these links:

  * [guardian jobs](https://jobs.theguardian.com/privacy-policy/) (jobseekers)

  * [guardian jobs](https://www.guardianjobsrecruiter.co.uk/privacy-policy/) (recruiters)

  * [guardian holidays](https://holidays.theguardian.com/privacy-policy/)

sometimes our sites and apps may contain links to sites and services that are
not part of the guardian family of offerings. [CLS] [SEP] these sites and services have
their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP] if you follow a link to these non-guardian sites
and apps, you should read the privacy policy shown on their site. [CLS] [SEP]

## **who we are and how to contact us**

guardian news & media limited, kings place, 90 york way, london n1 9gu is the
data controller in respect of your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this means that we are
responsible for deciding how and why we hold and use your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] if
you want to contact us directly, you can find our contact details in the “how
to contact us” section below. [CLS] [SEP]

## **the types of personal data we collect about you**

we collect your personal data when you visit our websites and apps, subscribe
for products or services, contribute to the guardian or when you interact with
us. [CLS] [SEP] we will only collect your personal data in line with applicable laws. [CLS] [SEP] we
collect your personal data in various ways:

  * directly from you, when you sign up for our services and when you browse our sites or use our apps

  * personal data we generate about you, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] personal data we use to authenticate you, or personal data in the form of your ip address or your preferences

  * personal data we collect from third parties, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] personal data that helps us to combat fraud or which we collect, with your permission, when you interact with your social media accounts

more detail about these three categories of personal data are provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

_the personal data we collect when you register for a guardian account_

when you register for a guardian account on theguardian.com, we collect:

  * your name

  * your email address

  * other details such as your residential or billing address when you sign up for membership or a subscription

  * some limited data from your social media profile (further information on this is below), if you have signed in to theguardian.com using your social media details

  * your photograph, if you add one to your profile page

you can change or remove these details using the profile and settings area of
your guardian account. [CLS] [SEP]

_personal data we generate about you_

when you register for a guardian account, we assign you a unique id number
that we use to recognise you when you are signed in to our services. [CLS] [SEP] this will
recognise you if you sign in using the same account on a new device or through
a different application such as the guardian app on mobile devices. [CLS] [SEP]

when you use our sites or apps we may also use cookies or similar technology
to collect extra data, including:

  * your ip address - a numerical code to identify your device, together with the country, region or city where you are based

  * your geolocation data - your ip address can be used to find information about the latitude, longitude, altitude of your device, its direction of travel, your gps data and data about connection with local wi-fi equipment

  * information on how you interact with our services

  * your browsing history of the content you have visited on our sites, including how you were referred to our sites via other websites

  * details of your computer, mobile, tv, tablet or other devices, for example, the unique device id, unique vendor or advertising id and browsers used to access our content

we will not collect special categories of data from you - such as personal
data concerning your race, political opinions, religion, health or sexual
orientation - unless you have chosen to provide that type of personal data to
us. [CLS] [SEP]

_when you use our apps_

the guardian apps use personal data based on the content you have viewed. [CLS] [SEP]
information on bugs and crashes is also sent to us when you use our apps. [CLS] [SEP] a
list of the articles that you have recently viewed is also cached in the local
storage on your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete this reading history in the
settings of the app. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose to receive notifications on your mobile
device via the app, and manage these notifications in the settings of the app. [CLS] [SEP]

_using your social media details to sign into your guardian account_

when you sign in to our sites or apps using your facebook login details, you
give permission to facebook to share with us your email address and certain
aspects of your facebook profile if you have made these public on your
facebook profile. [CLS] [SEP] this only includes your first and last name, age range, link
to your facebook profile and profile picture. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have access to updates
on your facebook profile. [CLS] [SEP] if you use your google login details, you give
google permission to share the personal data that you have made public in your
google profile. [CLS] [SEP] this only includes your first and last name, your email
address and whether your email address has been validated, your age range, a
link to your google profile and, if you have one, your profile picture. [CLS] [SEP] if you
register or sign in with your apple id, you give apple permission to share
your personal data with us. [CLS] [SEP] you can also choose to hide your email and apple
will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private. [CLS] [SEP]
this email address will be linked to your guardian profile and will be used to
retrieve your subscribed content. [CLS] [SEP]

we will then use this personal data to form a profile for your guardian
account. [CLS] [SEP] if you remove the guardian app from your facebook settings, or from
your google settings, or your apple id, we will no longer have access to this
data. [CLS] [SEP] however, we will still have the personal data that we received when you
first set up your guardian account using your facebook, google login, or apple
id. [CLS] [SEP]

_personal data when you post comments about the guardian on other social media
sites_

if you have mentioned the guardian in posts on social media sites, then we may
collect your social media handles. [CLS] [SEP] for example, when you mention the guardian
in a tweet, we may collect your twitter handle. [CLS] [SEP]

_when you post publicly (comments) on our sites_

when you post on a discussion board or comment publicly on an article on one
of our sites, the personal data you post, including your username and other
information about yourself, are publicly accessible. [CLS] [SEP] this personal data can be
viewed online and collected by other people. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the
way these other people use this personal data. [CLS] [SEP] when contributing to a
discussion, we strongly recommend you avoid sharing any personal details,
including information that can be used to identify you directly such as your
name, age, address and name of employer. [CLS] [SEP] we are not responsible for the
privacy of any identifiable information that you post in our online community
or other public pages of the site. [CLS] [SEP]

## **how we use your personal data**

we use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a
valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. [CLS] [SEP] we determine the legal grounds
based on the purposes for which we have collected your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 _legal grounds for using your personal data_

the legal ground may be one of the following:

  * _consent_ : for example, where you have provided your consent to receive marketing emails from us. [CLS] [SEP] you can withdraw your consent at any time. [CLS] [SEP] in the case of marketing emails you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or through your email preferences in the “emails and marketing” tab, when signed into your guardian account. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you)_ : for example, where you have purchased a subscription from us and we need to use your contact details and payment data in order to process your order and deliver your subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _compliance with law_ : in some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

  * _our legitimate interests_ : where it is necessary for us to understand our readers, promote our services and operate our sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of news, media and related journalistic content both online and in print form, globally. [CLS] [SEP] examples of when we rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal data include:

  * when we analyse what content has been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand how they are used and improve our content

  * to carry out marketing analyses to better understand your interests and preferences so that we can make our marketing more relevant to your interests and preferences. [CLS] [SEP] this includes when we promote our own products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we look at what you have viewed on our sites and apps and what products and services you have bought (including what you have looked at and what products or services you have bought on our other platforms, for example guardian jobs). [CLS] [SEP] you can opt out from having your personal data used for marketing analyses by going into your account to the tab “emails and marketing”

  * t0 show you personalised advertising by identifying your interests and to create “segments” of particular types of audiences so that we may show you advertisements that may be more relevant to your interests and the ‘’segments’’ you may be in. [CLS] [SEP] these ‘’segments’’ are also used to inform the building of custom audiences so that we can identify our audience across third party websites, such as social media platforms like facebook. [CLS] [SEP] to find out more about our advertising standards, please click this [link](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/feb/25/guardian-news-and-media-advertising-standards)

  * for internal administrative purposes related to when you use our services - such as our accounting and records - and to make you aware of any changes to our services

  * to collect and log ip addresses to improve the website and monitor website usage

  * to personalise our services (for example, so you can sign in) by remembering your settings, and recognising you when you sign in on different devices

  * enabling you to share our content with others using social media or email

  * when responding to your queries and to resolve complaints

  * for security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our sites and apps are safe and secure and used in line with our terms of use

where we rely on cookies to collect any personal data please see our [cookie
policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies) for more information and how
to manage your cookie choices. [CLS] [SEP]

_access permissions when you are using the guardian app_

when you use the guardian app, we ask for the following permissions to access
particular functions of your mobile device:

  * for the android version, we ask for permission to access your contact details/profile on your mobile device, so that we can add or find your guardian account on your phone. [CLS] [SEP] we also ask for permission to access the storage on your mobile device, so that you can store content and read when offline

  * for the ios version, we ask for permission to save pictures to your photo library, so that you can save pictures that you find in our articles on your mobile device

_updating your personal data and your profile page on our sites_

when you register for an account with theguardian.com, you have access to a
profile page. [CLS] [SEP] under “edit profile” you can review and update what personal
data is public when you comment on our articles, or if people look up your
profile. [CLS] [SEP]

you may also update your marketing preferences in the “emails and marketing”
tab in your account. [CLS] [SEP]

## **personal data that we receive about you from other organisations**

_adding to or combining the personal data you provide to us_

when you sign up to our services we may add to the personal data you give us
by combining it with other personal data shared with us by other trusted
organisations. [CLS] [SEP] this includes, for example, the region that you are located in,
so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your
local currency. [CLS] [SEP] we may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your
delivery address when we send out mail. [CLS] [SEP] we may also obtain your personal data
from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications
and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant
marketing. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites
and apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with
similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising
more relevant. [CLS] [SEP] sometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that
some of our global third parties have collected from you online to add you to
these groups, such as comscore and neilsen. [CLS] [SEP] please refer to our [cookie
policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies) for more information on how
we use cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

_personal data shared by event partners_

when you register or book a ticket for a guardian event organised by an event
partner, your registration data may be shared with us by the event partner. [CLS] [SEP]

## **using children’s personal data**

we do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the
age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under
13. [CLS] [SEP] some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be
shown at the point of registration. [CLS] [SEP] we also note that california law prohibits
sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless the
guardian has authorized the sale. [CLS] [SEP] we comply with this requirement. [CLS] [SEP]

## **security of your personal data**

we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to
protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against
accidental loss, damage or destruction. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for choosing a
secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our
sites or apps. [CLS] [SEP] you should keep this password confidential and you should
choose a password that you do not use on any other site. [CLS] [SEP] you should not share
your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. [CLS] [SEP]
unfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the
internet is not completely secure. [CLS] [SEP] although we will do our best to protect
your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any
personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at
your own risk. [CLS] [SEP]

## **when we share or sell your personal data**

_within the guardian group of companies_

depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the
guardian group of companies in the uk, us, or australia. [CLS] [SEP] we may share it in
order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we
have a legitimate interest in doing so. [CLS] [SEP] for example:

  * if you book an event held in australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the uk and then we may share it with the guardian in australia for administration purposes

  * if you are going to one of our events hosted by an event partner, we may share your personal data with that partner for event administration purposes

  * sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the guardian. [CLS] [SEP] we may decide to share this with the guardian archive run by the guardian foundation for historic and archiving purposes

  * we may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you. [CLS] [SEP]

_with external organisations_

we share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly
linked to us under the following circumstances:

_service providers_ \- we may share your data with other organisations that
provide services on our behalf. [CLS] [SEP] we may do this to perform a contract we have
entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your
consent. [CLS] [SEP] examples of when we may share your data with service providers
include sharing with:

  * companies that help deliver newspapers and subscription vouchers, such as i-movo

  * online payments processors who process credit and debit card transactions on our behalf

  * fraud management providers that help us to identify and prevent online fraud

  * internet and cloud hosting services providers, such as amazon web services (aws)

  * life-cycle engagement platforms such as braze, to help us build and manage our campaigns

  * software service providers such as salesforce that assist us with our customer relationship management

  * communications services providers, such as our podcast service provider called acast

  * error tracking software providers, such as sentry and google firebase, to help us diagnose and fix errors and optimise the performance of our website and apps

  * service providers that help provide us with insights and analytics that help us to improve our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use google analytics to understand how visitors engage with our sites or apps .

  * data management companies, such as formstack, that help us collect data via online forms and surveys

_advertising partners_ \- we may also share your data collected through our
websites and apps with our advertising partners, as set out in our [cookie
policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies). [CLS] [SEP] these partners help us
deliver relevant advertising across our websites and apps. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use
google ad manager to assist us with the delivery of relevant ads. [CLS] [SEP]

_agencies and authorities if required by law -_ we may reveal your personal
data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or
in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a
legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or
otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in
response to valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or
warrant). [CLS] [SEP] we will attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless
(i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear
indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of gnm services. [CLS] [SEP]

_event sponsors and partners_ \- we may share your personal data with sponsors
of guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes
when you have given your permission for us to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

_social media organisations_ \- we may share your personal data with other
organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations
(such as the “facebook recommend” function, twitter’s retweet function,
google+ function). [CLS] [SEP] these other organisations may receive and use personal data
about your visit to our sites or apps. [CLS] [SEP] if you browse our site or view content
on our apps, personal data they collect may be connected to your account on
their site. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on how these organisations use personal data,
please read their privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

_organisation/s that buy any of the guardian group companies_ \- we may share
your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we
transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. [CLS] [SEP] if this sale
or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure
that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with
our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

any organisations which access your data in the course of providing services
on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure
that they protect your data and keep to all data privacy laws that apply. [CLS] [SEP] we
may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they
meet our standards. [CLS] [SEP]

these transfers to third parties may constitute “sale” of your personal
information under california law. [CLS] [SEP] a california resident can halt these sales
at any time by pressing the “california resident - do not sell” link that is
located in the footer of every page. [CLS] [SEP] third-parties do not sell personal
information that has been sold to them by the guardian unless you have first
received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right
to opt out. [CLS] [SEP] you can read further about your california rights
[here](https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy#nav15). [CLS] [SEP] anyone using
the guardian, our sites, or our apps may manually inspect the sharing,
transfer, and sale of their personal data in our [cookie
policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies). [CLS] [SEP]

## **international data transfers**

data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or
territory where one or more of our guardian group companies or service
providers are based or have facilities. [CLS] [SEP] while other countries or territories
may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home
country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line
with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

whenever we transfer your personal data out of the european economic area
(eea), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these
safeguards:

  * we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we may also use specific approved contracts that use standard contractual clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the eea, including those based in the us and australia. [CLS] [SEP] these contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the eea. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are located in the eea, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards
which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the
eea. [CLS] [SEP]

## **how long we keep your personal data**

we keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. [CLS] [SEP] how long we need
your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may need to use it to answer your queries
about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you
are still using our product or services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also need to keep your
personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a
subscription. [CLS] [SEP] if we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it
anonymous by removing all details that identify you. [CLS] [SEP] if we have asked for your
permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds
to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will
delete your personal data. [CLS] [SEP] however, when you unsubscribe from marketing
communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send
you any marketing in future. [CLS] [SEP]

## **how we may contact you**

you, such as new guardian offers and updates. [CLS] [SEP] depending on your marketing

these emails through your profile page when you are signed in to your guardian
