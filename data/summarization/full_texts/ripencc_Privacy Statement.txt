# ripe ncc privacy statement

this is a live document. [CLS] [SEP] we will keep reviewing our processes and updating the
privacy statement accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] introduction

the ripe ncc respects the privacy of your personal information and is
committed to protecting the personal information that you provide. [CLS] [SEP] this ripe
ncc privacy statement applies to all personal information the ripe ncc
processes, including the collecting, publication, sharing and usage of
personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the ripe ncc privacy statement describes how the ripe
ncc processes your personal data and how you can access and make changes to
your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] processing your personal data

the main purpose for which the ripe ncc processes personal information is to
support its role as a regional internet registry (rir). [CLS] [SEP] the main activity to
fulfil this role is the registration and administration of internet number
resources, including the maintenance of the public ripe database (see 2.1). [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, the ripe ncc processes personal information for the purpose of
performing activities for the benefit of the ripe ncc members or for the
benefit of the ripe community (see 2.2). [CLS] [SEP]

### 2.1. [CLS] [SEP] personal data in the ripe database

the public ripe database shows registration details of internet number
resources. [CLS] [SEP] the records may contain contact details (name, email address, phone
and fax numbers and postal address) of persons responsible for the operation
of networks or routers and/or for maintaining the information in the ripe
database. [CLS] [SEP]

in some cases, the ripe ncc provides the initial registration. [CLS] [SEP] subsequently,
the personal information pertaining to a specific registration is provided and
maintained by a person authorised by, or acting on behalf of, the person or
entity to which the internet number resources have been registered. [CLS] [SEP] updating
is subject to an authentication and authorisation procedure (see 5). [CLS] [SEP] please
note that the ripe ncc is not responsible for data entered into the ripe
database by third parties. [CLS] [SEP] the person who enters personal data is responsible
for keeping all data they maintain accurate and up-to-date, including
maintaining correct contact details (see 6). [CLS] [SEP]

the ripe ncc publishes the contact details as part of the registration details
of internet number resources to make it possible for the ripe ncc and the
internet network community to contact the appropriate persons when it is
necessary:

  * to secure the proper functioning of the internet;
  * to prevent or redress possible misuse of the internet;
  * to improve the quality of the data;
  * to protect the information stored in the ripe database;
  * to prevent any unauthorised modification of information stored in the ripe database;
  * to ensure accountability for information entered into the ripe database. [CLS] [SEP]

the ripe database may also be mirrored to databases operated by other rirs,
excluding database objects that are meant to include personal information. [CLS] [SEP] the
databases of other rirs may also be mirrored to databases operated by the ripe
ncc. [CLS] [SEP] this system allows users to retrieve data on all internet resource
registrations worldwide from the rir in their region  
  
the ripe ncc also, for the purposes specified above, allows proxy access to
the ripe database via third parties. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, third parties may use a near
real time mirror (nrtm) of the ripe database or access its contents in bulk
via nightly dump and split files that are published by the ripe ncc. [CLS] [SEP] in both
cases, database objects that are meant to include personal information are
excluded. [CLS] [SEP]

where necessary for the above purposes, and to comply with statutory
obligations, the ripe ncc may also keep historical data (data that was
published in the ripe database before the record was updated) and ripe
database update requests. [CLS] [SEP]

### 2.2. [CLS] [SEP] processing your personal data for other purposes

in addition to the collection and use of personal data in relation to the ripe
database, the ripe ncc provides other services and activities that may require
the processing of your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] these include:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] ripe ncc member services: the ripe ncc may request contact details for services such as relationship management, accounting and billing;
  2. [CLS] [SEP] lir portal and the ripe ncc website (www.ripe.net): processing of messages, service requests and information requests;
  3. [CLS] [SEP] ripe community and ripe ncc membership mailing lists: messages including name, email address, date and message content are published in the mailing lists and mailing list archives to support the open and transparent ripe policy development process and discussions of membership-related issues;
  4. [CLS] [SEP] event registration administration for meetings, training courses and other organised events: the ripe ncc may publish lists of attendees on a website as part of its commitment to open and transparent policy development.
