privacy policy

1\. [CLS] [SEP] we do not (and will never) sell, license, sublicense or share any of the
data submitted directly or indirectly by our users with any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP]

nextdns inc. [CLS] [SEP] is an independent company 100% funded, owned and controlled by
its founders and will never engage in any data sharing or selling activities,
now or in the future. [CLS] [SEP]

2\. [CLS] [SEP] when the service comes into contact with user data that shall not be
logged, it is discarded as quickly as possible. [CLS] [SEP]

when answering a dns query, the server discards all request and response data
immediately after sending back the response to you. [CLS] [SEP]

3\. [CLS] [SEP] if not specifically requested by the user, no data is logged. [CLS] [SEP] some
features require some sort of data retention; in that case, our users are
given the option, control, and full access to what is logged and for how long. [CLS] [SEP]

you can fine-tune what is logged, for how long and in which jurisdiction — the
analytics and logs will gracefully adapt. [CLS] [SEP] we also follow a strict policy of
“what you see is what we have” (wysiwwh), letting you see, export or delete
every bit of your data at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

4\. [CLS] [SEP] we protect our users from privacy exposure to other services that we must
interact with in order to operate properly. [CLS] [SEP]

we use an [innovative in-house implementation of edns client
subnet](https://medium.com/nextdns/how-we-made-dns-both-fast-and-private-with-
ecs-4970d70401e5) that does not expose your ip address to authoritative dns
servers. [CLS] [SEP] we also enforce [query name
minimisation](https://www.isc.org/blogs/qname-minimization-and-privacy). [CLS] [SEP]

we use the following services as processors, as defined by the gdpr and
similar regulations. [CLS] [SEP]

stripe — for processing card payments

paypal — for processing paypal payments

bitpay — for processing cryptocurrency payments

sendgrid — for sending transactional emails
