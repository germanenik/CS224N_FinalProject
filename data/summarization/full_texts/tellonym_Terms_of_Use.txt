provider, and your method of payment in google play or  itunes (your “payment

purchase a subscription, your payment method will continue to be billed

if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in
to your payment method and follow instructions to terminate or cancel your

the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not

generally, all charges for purchases are non-refundable, and there are no
refunds or credits for partially used periods. [CLS] [SEP] we may make an exception if a
refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of the
transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for
refunds. [CLS] [SEP]

with local law, you are entitled to a full refund without stating the reason

“purchase history,” find the transaction and hit “report problem”. [CLS] [SEP] you can
also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com. [CLS] [SEP]

if you subscribed using your google play store account: please contact support
with your order number for the google play store (you can find the order
number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to google wallet). [CLS] [SEP]

**consequences of cancellation**

you cannot cancel an order for delivery of digital content that is not
delivered on a physical medium if order processing has begun with your
explicit prior consent and acknowledgement that you will thereby lose your
