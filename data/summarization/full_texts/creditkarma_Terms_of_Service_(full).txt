 **3.1 analysis and estimates**

as described in our [privacy statement,](/privacy) we may use your credit

sort, and present certain information or features to you. [CLS] [SEP]

illustrative and informational purposes only. [CLS] [SEP] our analysis and estimates are
based on certain assumptions and use only the data we have. [CLS] [SEP] our analysis and
estimates are neither endorsed by, nor commissioned by, any of our marketing
partners. [CLS] [SEP] the methodology we use to determine which offers, analysis, or other
information is presented or highlighted is proprietary and we may elect to
consider, ignore, emphasize, or de-emphasize certain factors in our sole and
absolute discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

 **summary** : when it comes to your financial health, we want to be like a

or eligibility for any particular product or service or for employment. [CLS] [SEP]

 **summary** : the credit scores that lenders and others use may be different
than the one you see here. [CLS] [SEP] that's because there are hundreds of scoring models
out there, and they all weigh things a little differently. [CLS] [SEP] most scores are
generally based on similar credit factors though, so tracking one or two will
still give you a good overview of your credit health. [CLS] [SEP]

 **8\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability**

you for all claims arising out of or relating to the use of, or any inability

 **summary** : if someone sues us because of something you did, you're

 **10\. [CLS] [SEP] dispute resolution and arbitration**

the following section is not applicable to residents of quebec to whom the
quebec consumer protection act applies. [CLS] [SEP]

 **preemptive summary**: a third party arbitrator will help us resolve any
disputes we might have. [CLS] [SEP] this means that any dispute will be resolved outside
of class-action litigation. [CLS] [SEP] hopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but
you should read this section carefully for details on how it works. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.1 generally**

in the interest of resolving disputes between you and credit karma in the most
expedient and cost-effective manner, you and credit karma agree that every
dispute arising in connection with the agreement will be finally resolved by
binding arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP]
arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow
for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
review by courts. [CLS] [SEP] arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a
court can award. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims
arising out of or relating to any aspect of the agreement, whether based in
contract, tort, extra-contractual liability, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a
claim arises during or after the termination of the agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator
also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

 **you understand and agree that by entering into the agreement, you and
credit karma are each waiving the right to participate in a class action.**

 **10.2 exceptions**

despite the provisions of section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in
the agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right
of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court
within its jurisdictional limits; (b) file a complaint with the applicable
federal, provincial, territorial, or local agency if that action is available;
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to
file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop
unauthorized use or abuse of our services or address an intellectual property
infringement claim. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.3 arbitrator**

all disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement, or in
respect of any legal relationship associated with or derived from this
agreement, will be finally resolved by arbitration under the arbitration rules
of the adr institute of canada, inc. [CLS] [SEP] (the "adr rules"), except as otherwise
set out in this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] the language of the arbitration will be english. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.4 notice and process**

a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of
the dispute to the other by certified mail ("notice"). [CLS] [SEP] credit karma's address
for notice is: credit karma, llc, p.o. [CLS] [SEP] box 30963, oakland, ca 94604, usa,
attention: legal department. [CLS] [SEP] the notice must: (a) describe the nature and
basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
("demand"). [CLS] [SEP] you and credit karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve
the claim directly, but if you and credit karma do not reach an agreement to
do so within 30 days after the notice is received, you or us may commence an
arbitration proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] during the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
offer made by you or credit karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator
until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be
confidential and you and credit karma agree to use reasonable efforts to
streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the
objectives of efficient dispute resolution. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.5 fees**

if you commence arbitration in accordance with the agreement, credit karma
will reimburse you for your payment of the commencement fee, unless your claim
is for more than ten thousand canadian dollars ($10,000), in which case the
payment of any fees will be decided by the adr rules. [CLS] [SEP] any arbitration hearing
will take place at a location to be agreed upon in toronto, ontario, but if
the claim is for $10,000 canadian dollars or less, or as otherwise required,
you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance
based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the
adr rules in the jurisdiction of your registered account address. [CLS] [SEP] if the
arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought
in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the
payment of all fees will be governed by the adr rules. [CLS] [SEP] in that case, you agree
to reimburse credit karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
otherwise your obligation to pay under the adr rules. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of the manner
in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned
written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions
on which the decision and award, if any, are based. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may make
rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party
made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.6 no class actions**

 **you and credit karma agree that each may bring claims against the other
only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or a class
member in any purported class or representative proceeding.**

further, unless both you and credit karma agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
not consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any
form of a representative or class proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.7 modifications**

if credit karma makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other
than a change to credit karma's address for notice), you may reject the change
by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to credit karma's
address for notice, in which case your account with credit karma will be
immediately terminated but this arbitration provision, as in effect
immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10.8 enforceability**

if any provision of this section 10 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for
any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent
possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]
notwithstanding the foregoing, if section 10.6 is found to be unenforceable or
if the entirety of this section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the
entirety of this section 10 will be null and void and, in that case, the
parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue described in section 12.1 will
govern any action arising out of or related to the agreement. [CLS] [SEP]
