following the guidelines below helps to keep the community safe for everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

the rules:

  * any manner of bullying, intimidation, or harassment is forbidden. [CLS] [SEP]
  * this is not a dating application; using the app in that way will result in expulsion from the community. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * you may not post pornographic or violent content in messages, in group chats, or on your profile. [CLS] [SEP] this includes adding photographs, drawings, or comments, even as a joke. [CLS] [SEP] depictions of nudity in non-sexual contexts, such as images of your surgery scars, are okay. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not ask other members to take the conversation to another messaging platform such as whatsapp, google hangouts, gmail, etc. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * the promotion, advertising, or selling of any goods or services is not allowed. [CLS] [SEP] unauthorized content will be removed from the app. [CLS] [SEP]
  * do not attempt to convert other members to your religious beliefs or otherwise make them feel uncomfortable. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * it should go without saying, but all illegal activity is prohibited and may be reported to the appropriate authorities. [CLS] [SEP]
  * finally, don’t spam anyone. [CLS] [SEP]

reporting

we rely on you, our apps community members, to report other members or content
that violates these guidelines. [CLS] [SEP] violating these community guidelines has
consequences, which may include removal of content, suspension of posting
privileges, or even expulsion from the apps community. [CLS] [SEP] please keep in mind
that while something may be disagreeable to you, it does not necessarily
violate our community guidelines. [CLS] [SEP]

to report another member or content

when reporting another member, you have two options:

  * **block member** : this blocks both parties from showing up in the other person’s member list, home activity feed, and group discussions. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, 1:1 communication is not possible. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * **report and block member** : in addition to blocking the member, this creates a report, marking this member as someone who has broken the community guidelines. [CLS] [SEP] 

you can report and/or block a member from the following places:

  * **1:1 chats**
    * when you receive a match request from another member, you can accept, decline, or choose to report and block. [CLS] [SEP]
    * after you are already connected with another member, you may click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner in your private messaging screen and choose “report” or “block” from the menu options. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **group chats**
    * click on the member's profile picture and tap “block member” or “report and block member.”
    * long-press on the offensive message and select “block member” or “report and block member.”
  * **home**
    * click on the member's profile picture and tap “block member” or “report and block member.”
    * press the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the offensive message and select ‘‘block member” or “report and block member.”

  * you must not establish a link from any website that is not owned by you. [CLS] [SEP]
