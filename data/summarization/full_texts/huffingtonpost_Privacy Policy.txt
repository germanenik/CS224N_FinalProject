### 2\. [CLS] [SEP] about this privacy notice

about you and processes information that identifies or can be used to identify
you (sometimes referred to as "personal data" or "personal information" under
applicable privacy and data security laws, and hereinafter "personal data")
when you use our website(s), mobile apps, and other online products or
services that link to this privacy policy (collectively, the "services") or
when you otherwise interact with us. [CLS] [SEP] from time to time we partner with third
parties to provide you with products, promotions or other experiences. [CLS] [SEP] we will
show you the privacy policies belonging to those third parties when they will

[data-privacy@buzzfeed.com](mailto:data-privacy@buzzfeed.com) _

### 5\. [CLS] [SEP] what personal data we collect and how

### 5.1 personal data you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect data you provide directly to us. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **account data.** if you sign up for a buzzfeed.com account ("account"), we will collect data you give us related to your account, including your name, email address, username and password. [CLS] [SEP] we describe this more fully in section 5.4 below. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **payment data.** to order products or services through our services, you may need to provide certain financial information (like your bank account or credit card information) in order to facilitate the processing of payments. [CLS] [SEP] we will collect the data we need in order to process that purchase (for example, payment details). [CLS] [SEP] however, your financial information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company, and use and storage of that data is governed by the third party payment processor's applicable privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **purchase data.** if you make a purchase from a third party after clicking on an affiliate link through the services, we will receive data about the purchase for the purpose of managing our business relationship. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **additional account data.** you may provide additional data as part of your account (such as your personal description). [CLS] [SEP] this data will be publicly visible to others. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not wish to share this information with us or others, do not provide the information as part of your account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **other data you share through the services.** you may provide us with data when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your account, respond to surveys, post to community forums, provide us with feedback, participate in promotions, or use other features of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5.2 data that indirectly identifies you and automatically collected data. [CLS] [SEP]

when you access or use the services, we collect data that indirectly
identifies you and we automatically collect other data about you, including:

  * **log data.** we automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with the services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we collect your internet protocol (ip) address, mobile device id, time zone setting, language preference, operating system, platform, internet service provider (isp), and links you have clicked on or shared with others, including through email and social media. [CLS] [SEP] if you sign up for an account, we also create a user id that indirectly identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] we use this information to collect data about your activities through the services. [CLS] [SEP] we associate information that indirectly identifies you with your account (if you have one) and other information we have collected about you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **cookies.** when you visit the services, we will set certain "cookies" and similar tracking technologies on your device, including cookies and web beacons. [CLS] [SEP] for more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see our ["cookie policy"](https://www.huffpost.com/static/privacy-policy#section-13) section below. [CLS] [SEP]

we also may use these technologies to collect data about your online
activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services
(behavioral tracking). [CLS] [SEP]

the information we collect automatically may include personal data, or we may
maintain it or associate it with personal data we collect in other ways or
receive from third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5.3 location data. [CLS] [SEP]

we use your ip address to infer your approximate location. [CLS] [SEP] we may also collect
the language option or country you choose. [CLS] [SEP] when we provide certain services,
such as providing you with a version of our services that is localized to your
country, we link location data to other information we have collected about
you in order to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5.4 profile data. [CLS] [SEP]

if you sign up for an account, we will collect certain data you give us as
part of your account sign-up as described above, information you give us in
connection with purchases or orders made by you, and your interests,
preferences, feedback and survey responses. [CLS] [SEP] your interests and preferences are
inferred from data we collect regarding what types of content you have
interacted with, how long you interacted with them, how often you interacted
with them, and the nature of your interaction with the content. [CLS] [SEP] we do not
disclose email addresses to other users except where it is necessary to comply
with the law, to protect our rights, or to protect the rights of our users. [CLS] [SEP]

### 5.5 special category data. [CLS] [SEP]

when we conduct research or carry out surveys and you participate in our
research or surveys, we may collect sensitive personal data about you, for
example, information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation. [CLS] [SEP] we will
get your explicit consent for our collection, use, or sharing of this data as
required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

### 6\. [CLS] [SEP] aggregated data

6.1 we analyze and aggregate personal data we collect, such as the number and
frequency of your visits to the services, to produce anonymized metrics and
statistical information that does not identify you as an individual. [CLS] [SEP]

6.2 we combine information about you with information about other users to
create audience segments of aggregated data, for example, statistical,
demographic and usage data. [CLS] [SEP] if we combine or connect aggregated data with your
personal data, we treat the combined data as personal data and deal with it in
accordance with this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### 7\. [CLS] [SEP] how we collect personal data

7.1 you may give us your personal data directly, for example when you create
an account, fund us by donation, support us by paying for a subscription, buy
products or services, subscribe to our newsletters, opt-in to marketing
communications, publish posts or comments, enter a competition, participate in
a promotion or survey, ask for user support, or contact us for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

7.2 we automatically collect personal data when you interact with our
services. [CLS] [SEP] we collect information about your devices and browsing actions and
interests by using cookies and similar technologies. [CLS] [SEP] our ["cookie
policy"](https://www.huffpost.com/static/privacy-policy#section-13) section
provides more details on how this works. [CLS] [SEP]

7.3 third parties who provide advertising and related services (such as
analytics providers and ad networks) may give us your personal data so that we
can compare it to personal data we hold in order to determine if you are the
same individual (this is sometimes called "cookie-matching"). [CLS] [SEP] we may collect
data from unaffiliated third parties so we can better understand you and
provide you with information and offers that may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we may receive information about your interests or preferences as
well as contact information, such as email address. [CLS] [SEP]

7.4 we may receive your personal data from third parties when you buy things
through our services or when you buy things from a third party after clicking
on an affiliate link in our content. [CLS] [SEP] this information may include your contact
details and financial and transaction data (such as items purchased and
purchase price) from providers of technical, payment and delivery services. [CLS] [SEP]

7.5 if you access our services using your facebook or google credentials, we
will automatically collect certain information, such as your facebook or
google user id. [CLS] [SEP] we will use any information collected from facebook or google,
including the user id facebook or google attribute to you, only in accordance
with facebook's or google's policies and your preferences selected through
facebook or google. [CLS] [SEP]

### 7.6 what we use your data for:

we use the data we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services. [CLS] [SEP] we
also use the data we collect to:

  * send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages and to respond to your comments, questions and customer service requests;
  * communicate with you about products, services, offers, and events offered by buzzfeed and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;
  * personalize and improve the services and provide advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests. [CLS] [SEP] your interests and preferences are inferred from data we collect regarding what types of content you have interacted with, how long you interacted with them, how often you interacted with them, and the nature of your interaction with the content;
  * facilitate contests, sweepstakes and promotions and process and deliver entries and rewards;
  * monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our services and personalize and improve the services;
  * detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of buzzfeed and others; and
  * carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the data was collected. [CLS] [SEP]

### 8\. [CLS] [SEP] marketing choices

when you sign up for a promotion like a sweepstakes, or subscribe to or create
an account to use our services, we use your personal data to help us decide
which products, services and offers may be of interest to you. [CLS] [SEP] we will send
marketing messages to you if you have asked us to send you information, bought
goods or services from us, or if you provided us with your details when you
entered a competition or registered for a promotion. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of
receiving marketing messages, we may still send you non-promotional emails,
such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. [CLS] [SEP] we will
ask for your consent before we share your personal data with any third party
for direct marketing purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

you may unsubscribe from marketing messages through a link we include on
messages we send you. [CLS] [SEP] you can also ask us to stop sending you marketing
messages at any time by contacting us at: [data-
privacy@buzzfeed.com](mailto:data-privacy@buzzfeed.com). [CLS] [SEP]

### 9\. [CLS] [SEP] sharing your personal data

in general, your personal data will remain with buzzfeed but we may share
personal data about you as follows or as otherwise described in this privacy
policy:

  * buzzfeed - we share your personal data within buzzfeed's legal entities where necessary to fulfill a contract or precontractual measures, or where we have a legitimate interest in doing so or a legal obligation to do so. [CLS] [SEP] buzzfeed's legal entities are listed in our ["buzzfeed legal entities"](https://www.huffpost.com/static/privacy-policy#section-16) section;
  * with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who process your data on our behalf when they provide services to us, for example data analytics, ad networks, research, marketing and financial services;
  * with third parties who use it for their own purposes if you have provided consent;
  * in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;
  * we may be legally required to disclose or share your personal data without your consent in some circumstances, for example to comply with a court order or law enforcement. [CLS] [SEP] in such circumstances, we will only disclose your personal data if we have a good-faith belief that such sharing is required under applicable legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

we may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot
reasonably be used to identify you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may share aggregated or
de-identified information with our ad partners and service providers so that
we, and they, can understand how people use our services; this helps us grow
our business and improve and develop our products and services. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad
campaigns on other platforms. [CLS] [SEP]

### 10\. [CLS] [SEP] uk and eu users: international transfer of your personal data

10.1 when we process your personal data within buzzfeed, we will do so in
countries in which we have offices (united states, india, australia, japan,
mexico, canada). [CLS] [SEP] we have put into place intra-group controls (including the
standard contractual clauses approved by the european commission) to ensure
that your rights continue to be protected. [CLS] [SEP]

10.2 third parties with whom we share your data may be based outside the eea
and their processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data
outside the eea. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, please refer to the privacy policy
links for such third parties in our consent management platform. [CLS] [SEP]

10.3 our agreements with those third parties include commission-approved
standard contractual clauses and otherwise make clear the standards we expect
of them in order to safeguard your information and your legal rights. [CLS] [SEP]

### 11\. [CLS] [SEP] retaining your personal data

11.1 we keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes for
which it was collected. [CLS] [SEP]

11.2 when we decide how long we will keep your information we consider the
amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of
harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, why we need it, and any relevant
legal requirements (such as legal retention and destruction periods). [CLS] [SEP]

11.3 we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be
associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. [CLS] [SEP]

### 12\. [CLS] [SEP] third-party sites

12.1 our sites and apps may include links to third-party sites, apps and
social media platforms ("third-party sites"). [CLS] [SEP] clicking on those links may
allow third parties to collect or share data about you. [CLS] [SEP] we do not endorse or
control third-party sites, each of which may be governed by its own terms of
service and privacy policy and we encourage you to read their privacy policies
and terms so that you understand how they process information about you. [CLS] [SEP] you
are solely responsible for all liability for any damages or other harm,
whether to you or third-parties, resulting from your use of third-party sites. [CLS] [SEP]
please take all protections necessary to protect yourself when accessing
third-party sites, particularly when downloading or purchasing anything
therefrom. [CLS] [SEP]

12.2 the services may offer social sharing features and other integrated
tools, which let you share actions you take on our services with other media,
and vice versa. [CLS] [SEP] your use of such features enables the sharing of information
with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with
the entity that provides the social sharing feature. [CLS] [SEP] we also use the analytics
tools provided by the social media platforms to help us to understand how
people interact with our social media presence, to identify trends and to
carry out joint promotional activities with those platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
sometimes we agree with a social media platform that we will jointly promote
certain content. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use the analytics tools provided by the social media platforms to help
us to understand how people interact with our social media presence, to
identify trends and to carry out joint promotional activities with those
platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for example, sometimes we agree with a social media platform that
we will jointly promote certain content. [CLS] [SEP]

we receive aggregated statistical information from social media platforms
about the performance of our posts and promoted content, such as numbers of
views and kinds of viewers. [CLS] [SEP] this data is aggregated and anonymized by the
social media platform prior to being made available to us. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use the paid advertising and paid content tools provided by the social
media platforms to help us carry out advertising campaigns for our ad partners
and to promote our content on the social media platforms. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use
the "promoted pins" tool on pinterest to promote editorial or paid content to
visitors to pinterest. [CLS] [SEP] again, we receive from the social media platforms only
aggregated statistical information about interactions with our ads and paid
content, such as number of views, number of times shared and so on. [CLS] [SEP]

we process information provided to us by the social media platforms on the
basis of our legitimate interest in interacting with our audience on social
media and using social media to promote our content. [CLS] [SEP]

processing in connection with social sharing features or your use of the
social media platforms, please visit the privacy policies of the respective

### 14.2 legal rights for eea and uk users

if you are an eu or uk resident, you have certain rights in respect of the
information that we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP] below is a short overview of those rights:

  * access. [CLS] [SEP] with some exceptions designed to protect the rights of others, you have the right to a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. [CLS] [SEP] where the data is data that you have given to us, you have the right to receive your copy of it in a common electronic format, and to provide copies of it to other people if you wish. [CLS] [SEP]
  * correction. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to have the personal data we hold about you corrected if it is factually inaccurate. [CLS] [SEP] this right does not extend to matters of opinion, such as views expressed in editorial content. [CLS] [SEP]
  * deletion. [CLS] [SEP] in some limited circumstances, you have the right to have personal data that we hold about you erased (the "right to be forgotten"). [CLS] [SEP] this right is not generally available where we still have a valid legal reason to keep the data (for example, because we are obliged to do so by law). [CLS] [SEP]
  * objection. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data where we rely on "legitimate interests" as our legal basis for processing, but we may be able to continue processing if our interest outweighs your objection. [CLS] [SEP]
  * withdrawing consent. [CLS] [SEP] if we are processing your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, in which case we will stop that processing unless we have another legal basis on which to continue. [CLS] [SEP]

### 14.3 how to exercise your rights

to exercise your rights, email [data-privacy@buzzfeed.com](mailto:data-

request you have made. [CLS] [SEP] if a third party is making a request on your behalf, we
will ask them to prove that they have your permission to act for you. [CLS] [SEP]

we may contact you to ask you for further information to help you exercise
your legal rights or to speed up our response. [CLS] [SEP] we will try to respond to
requests within one month and we will let you know if we need to take longer,
for example because your request is complicated. [CLS] [SEP] we may have an overriding
lawful basis for processing your personal data, or certain exemptions may
apply. [CLS] [SEP] if we refuse your request, we will explain why. [CLS] [SEP]

### 14.4 complaints

you have the right to complain about data privacy matters to the information
commissioner's office ([www.ico.org.uk](www.ico.org.uk)), or the relevant data
protection regulator in your country of residence. [CLS] [SEP] you can contact the ico on
