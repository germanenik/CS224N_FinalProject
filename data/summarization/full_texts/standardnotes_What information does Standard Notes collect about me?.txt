# what information does standard notes collect about me?

when you use our web, desktop, or mobile applications, no usage information is
collected whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP] apart from error reporting, our applications do not
contain analytics software. [CLS] [SEP] please read [ _what services does standard notes
use for daily operation?_](http://standardnotes.org/help/52/what-services-
does-standard-notes-use-for-daily-operation) to learn more about the services
we use. [CLS] [SEP]

on our guest-facing website only (the site you're reading this on,
standardnotes.org), we use a self-hosted, privacy-focused analytics suite
known as [matomo](https://matomo.org/), which anonymizes ip addresses. [CLS] [SEP]

when you sign up for a free notes account, an email is required. [CLS] [SEP] upon
registration, you will receive 1 welcome email from us. [CLS] [SEP] at the bottom of that
email, you will have the option to permanently unsubscribe from future emails,
or decrease your email level. [CLS] [SEP]

you may choose to anonymize your email during registration, however, this is
not recommended, as we will not be able to provide you with support on this
account. [CLS] [SEP]

you may choose to have your [account
deleted](https://standardnotes.org/help/19/how-do-i-delete-my-account). [CLS] [SEP] upon
doing so, all information related to your account is permanently deleted from
our production database. [CLS] [SEP] we maintain 14 day backups of our databases. [CLS] [SEP] after
the 14 day period, no trace of your information will remain on our system. [CLS] [SEP]

when you make a change to a note or other data item using our applications,
your data is first encrypted offline on your device using your secure key,
then synced to our server. [CLS] [SEP] our server cannot read the contents of the note. [CLS] [SEP] it
can however read the date the item was created and modified, the content type
of the item (whether it is a note or tag), and the user agent used to modify
the item (which browser and version, etc; non-personally identifiable; used
for debugging). [CLS] [SEP]

when you access any of our web services (syncing, website, extensions), your
network request goes through our aws-based firewall. [CLS] [SEP] to prevent spamming and
abuse, the firewall limits requests per ip address to a set amount over a
5-minute period. [CLS] [SEP] this means that ip addresses are necessarily remembered by
aws temporarily up to 5 minutes to determine if an ip is abusive, before
resetting this information. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, ip addresses are never stored in long-
term logs. [CLS] [SEP]
