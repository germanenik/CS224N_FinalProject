# privacy policy

this policy applies to all our all existing users as of 2018-05-17, and any
new users as of 2018-04-17. [CLS] [SEP]

**please note!** not everybody has a law degree or speak english natively, so
we have added helpful **tl;dr** ("too long; didn't read") in plain english
that summarize each term. [CLS] [SEP] these are only meant to help you understand the
general meaning and are not legally binding terms of service!



[upcloud](https://upcloud.com/about/) ltd ("upcloud", "we") might collect and
process personal data of users of upcloud’s website and online services. [CLS] [SEP] this
privacy policy applies to personal data we obtain from our customers and their
representatives ("users") through our websites when the relevant user
registers to upcloud’s cloud-based infrastructure and software services
(collectively, the "services"). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, some of our services might be
subject to a separate privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] if a separate privacy policy applies to
a particular service, we will post it on the relevant website or otherwise in
connection with the service in question. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** this privacy policy applies to the personal data of our users and
visitors. [CLS] [SEP]

our privacy policy explains what data we process, how we do that and how the
data subjects, i.e. [CLS] [SEP] users, may use their rights (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] right to object, right
of access). [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy constitutes a description of the data file as set out in
the finnish personal data act (sections 10 and 24). [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy may be updated if required in order to reflect the changes
in data processing practices or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] the current version can be found on
our website www.upcloud.com. [CLS] [SEP] we will not make substantial changes to this
privacy policy or reduce the rights of users under this privacy policy without
providing a notice thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** this policy might receive small updates, and if so, we’ll let you
know. [CLS] [SEP]

this privacy policy only covers data processing carried out by upcloud. [CLS] [SEP] the
privacy policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy
practices of any third parties. [CLS] [SEP] upcloud disclaims all responsibility for the
processing carried out by third parties, also in cases where services include
hyperlinks to third parties’ websites. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we take care of our users privacy but cannot be responsible for the
privacy practices of any third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

data. [CLS] [SEP]

### personal data processed and sources of data. [CLS] [SEP]

we collect two types of information from the users: (i) user data; and (ii)
technical data. [CLS] [SEP] although we do not normally use technical data to identify
individuals, sometimes individuals can be recognized from it, either alone or
when combined or linked with user data. [CLS] [SEP] in such situations, technical data can
also be considered to be personal data under applicable laws and we will treat
the combined data as personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we collect user data and technical data, both of which are
considered users’ personal data and treated as such. [CLS] [SEP]

upcloud may collect and process for example the following user data from
users: (i) name and contact details; (ii) e-mail address; (iii) phone number;
(iv) invoicing and billing information; (v) other personal data users provide
themselves. [CLS] [SEP]

the specific kind of user data collected will depend on the services used by
the user. [CLS] [SEP] most of the user data is received directly from users at the point
of registration or otherwise at beginning of and during the customer
relationship. [CLS] [SEP]

technical data we gather in connection with the use of our services includes
for example the following data: (i) user’s ip address; (ii) browser type and
version; (iii) preferred language; (iv) geographic location using ip address
or the gps, wireless, or bluetooth technology on your device; (v) operating
system and computer platform; (vi) the full uniform resource locator (url)
clickstream to, through, and from our services, including date and time; (vii)
products or services user viewed or searched for while using our services; and
(viii) areas of our services user has visited. [CLS] [SEP]

##### cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

we use various technologies to collect and store technical data and other
information when users visit our services, including cookies. [CLS] [SEP] cookies allow us
to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our services and monitor
the use of the services. [CLS] [SEP] this helps us to improve our services and better
serve our users. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use cookies that make the use of the services
easier, for example by remembering usernames, passwords and preferences. [CLS] [SEP] we
may use tracking and analytics cookies to see how well our services are being
received by our users. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we use web browser cookies to maintain, improve, and make the use of
our services easier. [CLS] [SEP]

users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert when
cookies are being sent. [CLS] [SEP] this can usually be done through internet browser’s
settings. [CLS] [SEP] information about how to manage cookies can be found online. [CLS] [SEP]

for example, the following links provide information on how to adjust the
cookie settings on some popular browsers:

  * [google chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=genie.platform%3ddesktop&hl=en)
  * [internet explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)
  * [mozilla firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-us/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
  * [safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411)

please note that some parts of our services may not function properly if use
of cookies is refused. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** you may decline cookies but our services might not work correctly
without them. [CLS] [SEP]

##### web analytics services. [CLS] [SEP]

our services use several web analytics services to compile technical data and
reports on visitor usage and to help us improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]

### purposes and legitimate grounds for processing of personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

#### purposes

there are several purposes for the processing of personal data by upcloud. [CLS] [SEP]
personal data is processed by upcloud for managing the relationships with
customers, facilitating transactions and payments, and for managing,
developing and analysing our customer service. [CLS] [SEP] personal data is also used to
direct marketing at special customer groups, and other business activities
related to any of these activities. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we process personal data to provide you with our services. [CLS] [SEP]

personal data is also processed by upcloud for the following purposes:

##### to provide our services and carry out our contractual obligations. [CLS] [SEP]

we process personal data in the first place to be able to offer the services
to our customers and users and to run, maintain and develop our business. [CLS] [SEP] in
some cases, personal data may be processed in order to carry out our
contractual obligations towards the user. [CLS] [SEP] we may use the data for example to
offer essential functionalities of the services and to provide access to the
services. [CLS] [SEP] if user contacts our customer service, we will use the provided
information for answering questions and solving possible issues. [CLS] [SEP]

##### for customer communication. [CLS] [SEP]

we may process personal data for the purpose of contacting users regarding our
services and to inform users of changes in our services. [CLS] [SEP] data may also be used
for research and analysis purposes in order to improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]

##### for quality improvement and trend analysis. [CLS] [SEP]

we may process information regarding the use of the services to improve the
quality of our services e.g. [CLS] [SEP] by analysing any trends in the use of our
services. [CLS] [SEP] when possible, we will do this using only aggregated, non-
personally identifiable data. [CLS] [SEP]

### legitimate grounds for processing. [CLS] [SEP]

we process personal data to perform our contractual obligations towards users
and to comply with legal obligations. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, we process personal data to
pursue our legitimate interest to run, maintain and develop our business. [CLS] [SEP]

in some parts of the services, users may be requested to grant their consent
for the processing of personal data. [CLS] [SEP] in this event, users may withdraw their
consent at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### transfer to countries outside of europe. [CLS] [SEP]

we store the users’ personal data primarily within the european economic area. [CLS] [SEP]
however, we have service providers in several geographical locations. [CLS] [SEP] as such,
we and our service providers may transfer personal data to, or access it in,
jurisdictions outside the european economic area or the user’s domicile. [CLS] [SEP]

we will take steps to ensure that the users’ personal data receives an
adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which it is processed. [CLS] [SEP] we
provide adequate protection for the transfers of personal data to countries
outside of the european economic area through a series of agreements with our
service providers based on the standard contractual clauses or other similar
arrangements. [CLS] [SEP]

more information regarding the transfers of personal data may be obtained by
contacting us on addresses mentioned in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

**tl;dr** we usually keep your personal data within the eea but might need to

issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of upcloud,
our users or the public in accordance with the law. [CLS] [SEP] when possible, we will
inform users about such transfer and processing. [CLS] [SEP]

##### to authorized service providers

we may share personal data to authorized service providers who perform
services for us (including data storage, sales, marketing and customer support
services). [CLS] [SEP] our agreements with our service providers include commitments that
the service providers agree to limit their use of personal data and to comply
with privacy and security standards at least as stringent as the terms of this
privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] please bear in mind that if you provide personal data directly
to a third party, such as through a link on our website, the processing is
typically based on their policies and standards. [CLS] [SEP]

##### for other legitimate reasons

if upcloud is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer
personal data to the third party involved. [CLS] [SEP] however, we will continue to ensure
the confidentiality of all personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we will give notice to all users

terms, a pro-rated refund of service will be paid back to the user. [CLS] [SEP]
