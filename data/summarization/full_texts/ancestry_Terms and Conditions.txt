1.1. [CLS] [SEP]  _eligibility to use the services_. [CLS] [SEP] unregistered guests, free registered
guests, paid subscribers, and people who purchase and/or activate a dna kit
are all " **users** " under these terms. [CLS] [SEP] you may need to create an account to
use the services. [CLS] [SEP] you must provide accurate, complete and current information
when you register. [CLS] [SEP] the services are intended for residents in the countries
where they are being offered. [CLS] [SEP] for example, services being offered at
ancestry.ca are intended for users in canada. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the services (excluding
any services requiring a dna test) with your parent's or guardian's
permission. [CLS] [SEP] children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use any
services. [CLS] [SEP] we do not knowingly seek or collect any personal information
directly from children under the age of 13. [CLS] [SEP] if ancestry becomes aware that we
have unknowingly collected any personal data directly from a child under the
age of 13, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to delete such data
from our system. [CLS] [SEP]

1.2. [CLS] [SEP]  _eligibility to use the dna services_ : you must be at least 18 years

own test. [CLS] [SEP] dna test kit activators must also explicitly consent to the
processing of sensitive personal information. [CLS] [SEP] a parent or legal guardian may

send us the saliva sample of their own minor child for processing using their
account. [CLS] [SEP] by activating a dna test for, or submitting any personal information
about, a minor you represent that you are the minor's parent or legal
guardian. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that you have discussed the dna test with the minor
and the minor has agreed to the collection and processing of their saliva. [CLS] [SEP]

1.3. [CLS] [SEP]  _use of the services_

in exchange for your access to the services, you agree that you will:

  * comply with the ancestry's [cookie policy](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/aboutcookies), [renewal and cancellation terms](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/renewal-cancellation-terms) and [community rules](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/community-rules);
  * comply with all applicable laws;
  * be responsible for all usage and activity on the services made via your account or with your log in information;

[CLS] [SEP]

**unexpected results** : when using our services, you may discover unexpected
facts about yourself, your family, or your health (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] you may discover an
unknown genetic sibling or parent, surprising facts about your ethnicity,
unanticipated genetic test results, or unexpected information in public
records). [CLS] [SEP] once discoveries are made, we can't undo them. [CLS] [SEP]

1.4. [CLS] [SEP]  _additional terms applicable to use of dna services_

as used in these terms, " **dna services** " refers to the use of our dna
collection kit, processing and handling of your dna sample, genetic testing of
your dna sample, and our web or mobile app-based tools that provide you with
ethnicity and other genetically related results and associated services,
including ancestryhealth®, if applicable. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to the requirements
described above, you also agree to the following terms for your use of dna
services:

  * you will not resell dna test kits;
  * any saliva sample you provide is either your own or the saliva of a person for whom you are a parent or legal guardian;
  * if you are outside the u.s, you will not send us a sample if sending us a sample would violate any export ban or other restriction in the country in which you reside or from which you are sending the sample;
  * you will not use the dna services outside of the country to which your dna test kit was shipped;
  * by providing a saliva sample or user provided content to us, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products developed by us or our collaborators and will receive no compensation related to any such research or product development; and,
  * you will not use the information obtained from the dna services (including any downloaded [dna data](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/privacystatement#personal-info-collect) (defined in the [privacy statement](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/privacystatement))) in whole, in part and/or in combination with any other database, for any medical, diagnostic, or paternity testing purpose, in any judicial proceeding, or for any discriminatory purpose or illegal activity. [CLS] [SEP]

_ancestry 's provision of dna services_. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree that we may directly
or through other companies who help us provide the dna services:

  * provide your saliva sample and dna to other companies that help us provide the services, such as laboratories;
  * extract your dna from your saliva;
  * perform genetic tests in the united states (or, in the future, in other countries) on the resulting dna using test methods available now or developed;
  * compare your dna results with other dna data in the ancestry database to provide the services, including matching you to others in our database with whom you share dna (you are in control as to whether or not to see and be seen by your dna matches);
  * disclose to you, and others that you authorize, the results of the tests performed;
  * store your dna results;
  * store your saliva and any extracted dna in the united states or destroy any remaining saliva or dna sample after your sample has been processed, as determined by you; in any case, once submitted to us, your saliva and dna sample cannot be returned to you;
  * allow certain of our laboratory partners to use a portion of activated or inactivated saliva samples to calibrate or validate instruments, equipment, or laboratory methods used in providing dna services; and,
  * use your [genetic information](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/privacystatement#genetic-information) and other [personal information](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/privacystatement#intro) as described in these terms and the [privacy statement](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/privacystatement). [CLS] [SEP]

we protect your information as described in our privacy statement. [CLS] [SEP] if you
choose to download a copy of your dna data, that copy is not protected by our
security measures and you are solely responsible for storing, securing, and
protecting that downloaded data. [CLS] [SEP] ancestry has no responsibility if you elect
to share or transfer your downloaded dna data with others, either
intentionally or inadvertently. [CLS] [SEP] your dna data is intended only for your
personal use. [CLS] [SEP]

_note to users who have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant_ : the
purpose of the dna services is to provide genetic and genealogy results and
related reports for your informational, recreational, educational and research
use. [CLS] [SEP] if you have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, your
ancestrydna test may provide unexpected results because your saliva may
contain cells with your dna as well as cells with your donor's dna. [CLS] [SEP] dna for
the test is extracted from the cells, and the combination of dna sources can
result in a failed test or a test that provides results based on your donor's
dna. [CLS] [SEP] therefore, we recommend that those who have received a bone marrow or
stem cell transplant do not take the ancestrydna® test. [CLS] [SEP] if you have already
taken the test, please [contact
us](https://support.ancestry.com/s/phonesupport) for further assistance. [CLS] [SEP]

with a 30-day cure period during which we are unable to cure, we will refund
any pre-paid fees on a pro-rated basis to you. [CLS] [SEP]

part of these terms or privacy statement is void or voidable, whether a claim
is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. [CLS] [SEP]
the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available
in a court under law or in equity. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator's award shall be written and

proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP]

hearing expenses. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the
arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

_no class actions_ : **you and ancestry each agree that each party may only
resolve disputes with the other on an individual basis and may not bring a
claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or
representative action.** if any court or arbitrator determines that the class
action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any
reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the
arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their
entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
disputes. [CLS] [SEP]
