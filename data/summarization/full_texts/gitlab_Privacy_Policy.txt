### data retention

gitlab will retain your information for as long as your account is active or
as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you the services,
comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or
enforce our agreements. [CLS] [SEP]

we may delete inactive accounts and associated projects and repositories after
a period of twelve (12) months. [CLS] [SEP]

## rights and choices

you have the right to access, correct, restrict or delete your personal
information, and to port your personal information to another company. [CLS] [SEP] while
these rights may vary by jurisdiction, gitlab provides you with the same
rights and choices, no matter where you live. [CLS] [SEP]

you may exercise your choices and rights as follows:

_to opt out of email marketing:_ you may opt-out of email marketing by
clicking the âunsubscribeâ link located at the bottom of any email you
receive or by visiting our [preference
center](https://about.gitlab.com/company/preference-center/) and
unsubscribing. [CLS] [SEP] you may continue to receive transactional email messages about
your account and the service after you have unsubscribed. [CLS] [SEP]

_to opt-out of interest-based advertising:_ if you wish to opt-out of
interest-based advertising, please visit the cookie policy to see your
options. [CLS] [SEP]

_request a copy of your information:_ you may [request a copy of the personal
information](/handbook/gdpr/) that gitlab has about you. [CLS] [SEP]

_update your information:_ if you already have an account, you may access,
update, or alter your user profile information by logging into your account
and updating profile settings. [CLS] [SEP]

_to delete your account:_ you may delete your account by logging into your
account and going to the âdelete my accountâ option in your profile
settings. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that due to the open source nature of our services, we may retain
limited personal information indefinitely in order to provide a transactional
history. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you provide your information in connection with a
blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted
your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. [CLS] [SEP] also, if you
contribute to a public project (not owned by gitlab), and you provide your
personal information in connection with that contribution, your personal
information will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution,
and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the
project. [CLS] [SEP]

if you contribute to a gitlab project by commenting in, or creating an issue
or merge request and you provide your personal information in connection with
that contribution, your personal information associated with your contribution
will be deleted and attributed to a ghost user. [CLS] [SEP] however, please note that if
the content of the contribution contains personal information, this
information would remain and you will need to submit a specific request to
have this information deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

_to port your projects:_ you may port your projects by either using the
[export
functionality](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html)
provided within the saas product which will also include all metadata, or by
cloning your repositories. [CLS] [SEP] to port your profile information, you may use the
[api](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#for-user). [CLS] [SEP]

### california privacy rights

under the california consumer privacy act (âccpaâ) you are entitled to
certain rights such as access to your specific personal information, details
about our processing of your personal information, and the right to delete
your information. [CLS] [SEP] you may exercise all of these rights as described in the
âyour rights and choicesâ section. [CLS] [SEP] gitlab does not sell your personal
information, as defined under ccpa, and has not done so for the past 12
months. [CLS] [SEP]

you may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized
agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the ccpa. [CLS] [SEP]
before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to
provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need
you to verify your identity directly with us. [CLS] [SEP] to provide or delete specific
pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the
degree of certainty required by law. [CLS] [SEP] we will verify your request by using one
of the methods set forth [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/gdpr/). [CLS] [SEP]

### information gitlab does not collect

gitlab does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as
social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious
information. [CLS] [SEP] although gitlab does not request or intentionally collect any
sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of
information in a gitlab repository. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a child under the age of 13,
you may not have an account. [CLS] [SEP] gitlab does not knowingly collect information
from, or direct any of our services to, children under 13. [CLS] [SEP] if we learn or have
reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the
childâs account. [CLS] [SEP]

### policy changes

gitlab may change its privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] when we do, we will
update the date at the top of this policy. [CLS] [SEP] if we decide to make a significant
change to our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the update on the
homepage of our website. [CLS] [SEP] we may also provide notification via email of any
material changes to our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### contact us

your information is controlled by gitlab b.v. [CLS] [SEP] and gitlab inc. [CLS] [SEP] if you have
questions or concerns about the way we are handling your information, please
