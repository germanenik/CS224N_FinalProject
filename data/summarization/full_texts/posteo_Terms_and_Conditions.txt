![](/images/paragraph.png)

## 1\. [CLS] [SEP] area of application and changes to these conditions

1.1. [CLS] [SEP] these terms and conditions govern the customer's use of the email service
posteo e.k., methfesselstr. [CLS] [SEP] 38, 10965 berlin, germany (âposteoâ). [CLS] [SEP]

1.2. [CLS] [SEP] customers will be informed of any changes. [CLS] [SEP] if changes occur that are to
the disadvantage of the customer, they can terminate the relationship without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] posteo also advises customers of their right to terminate in the
notification of changes. [CLS] [SEP]

## 2\. [CLS] [SEP] customer relationship

2.1. [CLS] [SEP] the contract regarding use of posteo takes effect through the
customerâs completion of the online sign-up form. [CLS] [SEP]

## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] services

3.1. [CLS] [SEP] after registration, customers gain access to their account. [CLS] [SEP] until the
first payment has been made, the customer can only send 10 emails within a two
hour period. [CLS] [SEP] after setting up the account, the following services are
available to the customer:

  * a personalised email address in the form âdesiredname@posteo.deâ
  * two additional alias email addresses configurable by the customer
  * an email account with 2 gb storage capacity
  * ability to send and receive emails
  * attachments of up to 50 mb are supported
  * spam filter: emails identified as spam will not be accepted by our system (rejected)
  * the customer has the ability to set up a list in order to ensure that emails from particular senders are always delivered
  * virus filter: incoming emails that contain a virus will be deleted and not delivered to the customer
  * webmail service with synchronisable address book and calendar
  * email forwarding
  * autoreply option (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] out-of-office)
  * pop migration service, to collect your emails with other providers in your posteo account
  * server powered by 100% green energy from greenpeace energy

if the customer's storage space becomes full, the email account will not be
able to receive any more emails. [CLS] [SEP] customers can change the size of their
account via the posteo website. [CLS] [SEP] when increased, each additional gigabyte of
storage costs an extra 0.25 eur per month. [CLS] [SEP] over and above the two aliases
included free, up to 20 aliases can be set up, costing 0.10 eur per alias per
month. [CLS] [SEP]

3.2 posteo is generally available 24 hours a day. [CLS] [SEP] posteo can make no
guarantees about the continual availability of all services. [CLS] [SEP] outages due to
possible maintenance work will be advised of in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

## 4\. [CLS] [SEP] fees and payment methods

4.1 in order to use posteo, the customer is required to pay the monthly fee
after sign-up. [CLS] [SEP] payment by bank transfer or paypal is to be made for 12 months
in advance. [CLS] [SEP] if submitting payment by letter mail we only accept bank notes,
therefore payment needs to be made for 15 months in advance. [CLS] [SEP] if the contract
is ended prematurely (by either party) any remaining credit can be refunded. [CLS] [SEP]
the customer can add a maximum of 120 eur credit. [CLS] [SEP]

immediately change or reset it, if an unauthorised third party may have
discovered it. [CLS] [SEP]

6.2 customers are liable to posteo for damages resulting from a breach of
their responsibilities under 6.1 and absolve posteo from claims of any third
parties in this regard. [CLS] [SEP] this does not apply when the unauthorised access had
nothing to do with the customer. [CLS] [SEP] the obligation is on the customers to prove
they had nothing to do with the usage. [CLS] [SEP]
