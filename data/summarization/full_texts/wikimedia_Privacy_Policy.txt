### welcome!

the wikimedia foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates
collaborative, free knowledge websites, like
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page "wikipedia:main page"),
[wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/main_page "commons:main
page"), and [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wiktionary:main_page
"wiktionary:wiktionary:main page"). [CLS] [SEP]

this policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

  * we collect very little personal information about you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we do not rent or sell your information to third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

by using wikimedia sites, you consent to this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

the wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can
do more together than any of us can do alone. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot work collectively
without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we
seek new ways to make the wikimedia sites more usable, safer, and more
beneficial. [CLS] [SEP]

we believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with
transparency. [CLS] [SEP] this privacy policy explains how the wikimedia foundation, the
non-profit organization that hosts the wikimedia sites, like wikipedia,
collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of
the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] it is essential to understand that, by using any of the
wikimedia sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage,
disclosure, and use of your information as described in this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]
that means that reading this policy carefully is important. [CLS] [SEP]

we believe that you shouldn't have to provide nonpublic personal information
to participate in the free knowledge movement. [CLS] [SEP] you do not have to provide
things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a
standard account or contribute content to the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not sell or rent your personal information, nor do we give it to others
to sell you anything. [CLS] [SEP] we use it to figure out how to make the wikimedia sites
more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning
and contributing more fun. [CLS] [SEP] put simply: we use this information to make the
wikimedia sites better for you. [CLS] [SEP]

after all, it's people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it
possible for the wikimedia sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive. [CLS] [SEP]

#### definitions

back to top [![wwc arrow
up.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/wwc_arrow_up.png)](/wiki/privacy_policy#top
"privacy policy#top")

we recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms
like “tracking pixels” and “cookies” used in the privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] whether you
are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a
refresher, you might find our [glossary of key
terms](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms)
helpful. [CLS] [SEP]

because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how
and why their information is collected and used, we use common language
instead of more formal terms throughout this policy. [CLS] [SEP] to help ensure your
understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:

  

when we say... [CLS] [SEP]  | ... [CLS] [SEP] we mean:  
---|---  
"the wikimedia foundation" / "the foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our"  | the
wikimedia foundation, inc., the non-profit organization that operates the
wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]  
"wikimedia sites" / "our services"  | wikimedia websites and services
(regardless of language), including our main projects, such as wikipedia and
wikimedia commons, as well as mobile applications, apis, emails, and
notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "what this
privacy policy doesn't cover" section below. [CLS] [SEP]  
"you" / "your" / "me"  | you, regardless of whether you are an individual,
group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the wikimedia
sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. [CLS] [SEP]  
"this policy" / "this privacy policy"  | this document, entitled the
"wikimedia foundation privacy policy". [CLS] [SEP]  
"contributions"  | content you add or changes you make to any wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]  
"personal information"  | information you provide us or information we collect
from you in the context of your use of the wikimedia sites that could be used
to personally identify you. [CLS] [SEP] to be clear, while we do not necessarily collect
all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following
to be personal information if it can be used to identify you:

    (a) name, address, phone number, email address, username, password, identification number on government-issued id, ip addresses, user-agent information, and credit card number; and;
    (b) when associated with an identifiable person, any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, genetic and biometric data, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. [CLS] [SEP]  
"third party" / "third parties"  | individuals, entities, websites, services,
products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by
the wikimedia foundation. [CLS] [SEP] this includes other wikimedia users and independent
organizations or groups who help promote the wikimedia movement such as
[wikimedia chapters](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikimedia_chapters
"m:wikimedia chapters"), [thematic
organizations](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikimedia_thematic_organizations
"m:wikimedia thematic organizations"), and [user
groups](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikimedia_user_groups "m:wikimedia
user groups") as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, [grant
recipients](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/grants:table "m:grants:table"),
and contractors of those organizations or groups. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
#### what this privacy policy does & doesn't cover

except as explained below, this privacy policy applies to our collection and
handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of
any of the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] this policy also applies to information that we
receive from our partners or other third parties. [CLS] [SEP] to understand more about
what this privacy policy covers, please see below. [CLS] [SEP]

examples of what this privacy policy covers  
  
---  
  
for the sake of clarity, this privacy policy covers, regardless of language:

  * all of our major sites (found at [list of major projects](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/projects "m:projects")), such as wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards. [CLS] [SEP]
  * our blogs and apis (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services). [CLS] [SEP]
  * official wikimedia foundation mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP]
  * emails, sms, and notifications from us or sent to us from you. [CLS] [SEP]

  
  
this privacy policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may
gather or process information. [CLS] [SEP] for example, some uses may be covered by
separate privacy policies (like those of the [wikimedia
shop](https://shop.wikimedia.org)) or sites or services run by third parties
(such as third-party developer projects on [wikimedia cloud
services](https://labs.wikimedia.org)). [CLS] [SEP] to understand more about what this
privacy policy does not cover, please see below. [CLS] [SEP]

more on what this privacy policy doesn’t cover  
  
---  
  
this section is part of the privacy policy and is meant to explain in detail
which situations are not covered by our privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

wikimedia sites and tools with alternative policies

    some wikimedia foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] these websites include: 

  * **wikimedia shop** (covered by [the shop's policy](https://shop.wikimedia.org/pages/privacy-policy));
  * **donate.wikimedia.org** , including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by [the donor privacy policy](/wiki/special:mylanguage/donor_policy "special:mylanguage/donor policy")); and
  * **the[wikipedia reading lists browser extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/wikimedia_apps/synced_reading_lists "mw:wikimedia apps/synced reading lists")**, which is governed by a separate [privacy policy](/wiki/wikipedia_reading_lists_browser_extension_privacy_policy "wikipedia reading lists browser extension privacy policy"). [CLS] [SEP] this separate policy will also be made available where the extension can be downloaded. [CLS] [SEP]

    if a wikimedia foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. [CLS] [SEP] when a wikimedia foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. [CLS] [SEP]

community members

    the wikimedia sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. [CLS] [SEP] as a result, some volunteers have access to certain personal information, and use of that personal information may not be governed by this privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] volunteers that have such access include: 

  * **administrative volunteers** , such as [checkusers](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:mylanguage/checkuser "m:special:mylanguage/checkuser") or [stewards](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:mylanguage/stewards "m:special:mylanguage/stewards"). [CLS] [SEP] these are volunteers who enforce wikimedia site policies and ensure the safety of the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] when these administrators access personal information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our [access to nonpublic information policy](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:mylanguage/access_to_nonpublic_information_policy "m:special:mylanguage/access to nonpublic information policy"), as well as other, tool-specific policies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **tool providers**. [CLS] [SEP] tool providers. [CLS] [SEP] we support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as [wmflabs.org](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/wikimedia_cloud_services). [CLS] [SEP] when you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. [CLS] [SEP] when these volunteers access nonpublic information or personal information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **other users**. [CLS] [SEP] we provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. [CLS] [SEP] the communications may be covered by this policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] examples include: 
    * posting to foundation-hosted email lists;
    * requesting support from volunteers through our [online ticketing system](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:mylanguage/otrs "m:special:mylanguage/otrs") (email sent to info[at]wikimedia.org goes to this system);
    * emailing other users through the wikimedia sites (for example, by using the "email this user" feature); and

third parties

    this privacy policy only covers the way the wikimedia foundation collects, uses and discloses personal information and does not address the practices of third parties. [CLS] [SEP] for example, this privacy policy does not address the practices of: 

  * **websites run by other organizations** , like websites linked to from the “references” sections of wikipedia, or run by wikimedia chapters or other [movement organizations](/wiki/resolution:recognizing_models_of_affiliations "resolution:recognizing models of affiliations"). [CLS] [SEP] these organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] they are governed by their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals**. [CLS] [SEP] these organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the wikimedia sites or wikimedia site content. [CLS] [SEP] they are governed by their own privacy policies. [CLS] [SEP]

sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script,
gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a wikimedia site without our
knowledge. [CLS] [SEP] this policy does not cover how third parties handle the information
they receive as a result of such a tool. [CLS] [SEP] if you come across such a third-party
tool, and you believe it violates this policy, you can remove the tool
yourself, or report it to privacy[at]wikimedia.org so we can investigate. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
where community policies govern information, such as the [checkuser
policy](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/checkuser_policy "m:checkuser
policy"), the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out
in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] however, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or
otherwise reduce the protections offered by this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

### types of information we receive from you & how we get it

#### your public contributions

whatever you post on wikimedia sites can be seen and used by everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

when you make a contribution to any wikimedia site, including on user or
discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece
of content added, removed, or altered by you. [CLS] [SEP] the page history will show when
your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are
signed in) or your [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") (if you are not signed in). [CLS] [SEP] we may use
your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of
others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for
you or to learn more about how the wikimedia sites are used. [CLS] [SEP]

publicly visible information  
  
---  
  
unless this policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you
actively contribute to the wikimedia sites, including personal information, is
publicly visible and can be found by search engines. [CLS] [SEP] like most things on the
internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the
internet by other people. [CLS] [SEP] please do not contribute any information that you
are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or
location in your contributions. [CLS] [SEP]

you should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data
that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer
further information, such as which country a user is from, political
affiliation and gender. [CLS] [SEP]

#### account information & registration

you do not need to create an account to use any wikimedia site. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email
address. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly
attributed to your [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms"). [CLS] [SEP]

want to create an account? great! don't want to create an account? no problem!

you are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a wikimedia
site, except under [rare circumstances](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#needaccount
"privacy policy/faq"). [CLS] [SEP] however, if you contribute without signing in, your
contribution will be publicly attributed to the [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") associated with your device. [CLS] [SEP]

if you want to create a [standard
account](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#standardaccount "privacy policy/faq"), in
most cases we require only a username and a password. [CLS] [SEP]

more on usernames  
  
---  
  
your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about using your
real name as your username. [CLS] [SEP] your password is only used to verify that the
account is yours. [CLS] [SEP] your [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") is also automatically submitted to us,
and we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse. [CLS] [SEP] no other personal
information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no
credit card information. [CLS] [SEP]

once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can
usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). [CLS] [SEP] this is
because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). [CLS] [SEP]
in some circumstances, the wikimedia communities [can
assist](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:mylanguage/right_to_vanish
"m:special:mylanguage/right to vanish") users with removing additional
information related to their account from the projects. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
to gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize
our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for
more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. [CLS] [SEP] we will
tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you
can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that
information. [CLS] [SEP] providing such information is always completely optional. [CLS] [SEP] if you
don't want to, you don't have to—it's as simple as that. [CLS] [SEP]

#### location information

##### gps & other location technologies

some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. [CLS] [SEP]

if you consent, we can use
[gps](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#gps "privacy policy/glossary
of key terms") (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to
show you more relevant content. [CLS] [SEP] we keep information obtained by these
technologies confidential, except as provided in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn
more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in
our [faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#gpsexamplesfaq "privacy policy/faq"). [CLS] [SEP]

##### metadata

sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, if you want to upload a photo on the wikimedia commons mobile app, we
may receive [metadata](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#metadata
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms"), such as the place and time you took
the photo, automatically from your device. [CLS] [SEP] please be aware that, unlike
location information collected using gps signals described above, the default
setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or
video upload to the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want metadata sent to us
and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on
your device. [CLS] [SEP]

##### ip addresses

finally, when you visit any wikimedia site, we automatically receive the [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") of the device (or your [proxy
server](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#proxy_servers "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms")) you are using to access the internet, which
could be used to [infer your geographical
location](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#inferlocationfaq "privacy policy/faq"). [CLS] [SEP]

### information related to your use of the wikimedia sites

we use certain technologies to collect information about how you use wikimedia
sites. [CLS] [SEP]

like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when
you visit the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

we also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect
information regarding how you use the wikimedia sites, make our services safer
and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable
experience for you. [CLS] [SEP]

we want to make the wikimedia sites better for you by learning more about how
you use them. [CLS] [SEP] examples of this might include how often you visit the wikimedia
sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the wikimedia
sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it
differently. [CLS] [SEP] we also want this policy and our practices to reflect our
community's values. [CLS] [SEP] for this reason, we keep information related to your use
of the wikimedia sites confidential, except as provided in this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

#### information we receive automatically

because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when
you visit the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] this information includes the type of device
you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for
some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your
[browser](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#browsers "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms"), your browser's language preference, the type
and version of your device's [operating
system](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#operating_system "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms"), in some cases the name of your internet
service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the
wikimedia sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of
each request you make to the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with wikimedia
sites. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide
greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize
content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and
improve performance; understand how users interact with the wikimedia sites,
track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the
demographics of the different wikimedia sites, and analyze trends. [CLS] [SEP]

"privacy policy#top")

#### information we collect

we use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand
how you use the wikimedia sites, make our services safer and easier to use,
and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. [CLS] [SEP]

we actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used
technologies. [CLS] [SEP] these generally include [tracking
pixels](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#tracking_pixel "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms"),
[javascript](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#javascript "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms"), and a variety of "locally stored data"
technologies, such as
[cookies](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#cookies "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms") and [local
storage](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#local_storage "privacy
policy/glossary of key terms"). [CLS] [SEP] we realize that some of these technologies do
not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble
purposes. [CLS] [SEP] so we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods
and the type of information we collect with them. [CLS] [SEP]

depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from
text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to personal
information (like your [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms")) and information about your use of the
wikimedia sites (like your username or the time of your visit). [CLS] [SEP]

we use this information to make your experience with the wikimedia sites safer
and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their
interaction with the wikimedia sites, and to generally improve our services. [CLS] [SEP]
we will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. [CLS] [SEP]
if you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been
authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another
user or administrator), please report it to us at
[privacy@wikimedia.org](mailto:privacy@wikimedia.org). [CLS] [SEP]

more on locally stored data  
  
---  
  
locally stored data, javascript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

  * provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting wikimedia issues and events in your area. [CLS] [SEP]
  * deliver more relevant content to you faster. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. [CLS] [SEP] also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * understand how you use the wikimedia sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in. [CLS] [SEP]
  * understand how you use the wikimedia sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied wikimedia sites more efficient and effective for you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * make the wikimedia sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field. [CLS] [SEP]

  
  
want to know even more? you can read more about some of the specific cookies
we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our
[faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#cookiefaq "privacy policy/faq"). [CLS] [SEP]

we believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you
may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser
settings, depending on your browser. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about some options you
have in our [faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#limitstoragefaq "privacy
policy/faq"). [CLS] [SEP] while locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites,
some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data. [CLS] [SEP]

while the examples above concerning information about you collected through
the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this
policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your
username is made publicly available through [public
logs](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#publiclogsfaq "privacy policy/faq") alongside
actions taken by other users. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a public log may include the date
your account was created on a wikimedia site along with the dates that other
accounts were created on a wikimedia site. [CLS] [SEP]

### other

#### location information

  

##### gps & other location technologies

as stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you
more relevant content. [CLS] [SEP] for example, our mobile apps can identify articles from
the wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. [CLS] [SEP] as a
reminder, you can deactivate our access to these location technologies at any
time, and still use the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

as stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. [CLS] [SEP]
for example, if you upload a photo using the wikimedia commons mobile app,
please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically
results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the
upload. [CLS] [SEP] as a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public

##### ip addresses

when you visit any wikimedia site, we automatically receive the [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") of the device (or your proxy server)
you are using to access the internet, which could be used to infer your
geographical location. [CLS] [SEP] we keep ip addresses confidential, except as provided
in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] if you are visiting wikimedia sites with your mobile device,
we may use your ip address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to
service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. [CLS] [SEP]

we use this location information to make your experience with the wikimedia
sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences
and their interaction with the wikimedia sites, and to generally improve our
services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we use this information to provide greater security,
optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support
wikimedia communities. [CLS] [SEP] we also use personal information in the manner
described in the sections of this policy titled "for legal reasons" and "to
protect you, ourselves & others."

we may share your information when you give us specific permission to do so,
for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below. [CLS] [SEP]

we share your information when you give us specific permission to do so. [CLS] [SEP]

we share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree. [CLS] [SEP] you can find

#### for legal reasons

we will disclose your information in response to an official legal process
only if we believe it to be legally valid. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you of such requests
when possible. [CLS] [SEP]

we will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your personal information if we
reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable
warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or
administrative order. [CLS] [SEP] however, if we believe that a particular request for
disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal
system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure
themselves, we will try our best to fight it. [CLS] [SEP] we are committed to notifying
you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we
disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand. [CLS] [SEP] however, we
may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you,
there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by
disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address. [CLS] [SEP]

nothing in this privacy policy is intended to limit any legal objections or
defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil,
criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend seeking
the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving
you. [CLS] [SEP]

in the unlikely event that the ownership of the foundation changes, we will
provide you 30 days’ notice before any personal information is transferred to
the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP]

in the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of
the foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger,
consolidation, or acquisition), we will continue to keep your personal
information confidential, except as provided in this policy, and provide
notice to you via the wikimedia sites and a notification on

#### to protect you, ourselves & others

we, or users with certain administrative rights, may disclose information that
is reasonably necessary to:

  * enforce or investigate potential violations of the wikimedia foundation or community-based policies;
  * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
  * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person. [CLS] [SEP]

we, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below,
may need to share your personal information if it is reasonably believed to be
necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our [terms of
use](/wiki/terms_of_use "terms of use"), this privacy policy, or any wikimedia
foundation or user community-based policies. [CLS] [SEP] we may also need to access and
share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or
actions. [CLS] [SEP]

wikimedia sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and
selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative
rights. [CLS] [SEP] these rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise
nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. [CLS] [SEP]
they use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight
harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior
on the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] these various user-selected administrative groups have
their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are
supposed to agree to follow our [access to nonpublic information
policy](/wiki/access_to_nonpublic_information_policy "access to nonpublic
information policy"). [CLS] [SEP] these user-selected administrative groups are
accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected
through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a
logged history of their actions. [CLS] [SEP] however, the legal names of these users are
not known to the wikimedia foundation. [CLS] [SEP]

we hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your personal
information if we believe that it's reasonably necessary to prevent imminent
and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization,
employees, contractors, users, or the public. [CLS] [SEP] we may also disclose your
personal information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent,
or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse,
unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. [CLS] [SEP] (check out the list of
examples in our [faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#investigateusefaq "privacy

#### to our service providers

we may disclose personal information to our third party service providers or
contractors to help run or improve the wikimedia sites and provide services in
support of our mission. [CLS] [SEP]

as hard as we may try, we can't do it all. [CLS] [SEP] so sometimes we use third-party
service providers or contractors who help run or improve the wikimedia sites
for you and other users. [CLS] [SEP] we give access to your personal information to these
providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use
their tools and services. [CLS] [SEP] we put requirements, such as confidentiality
agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your
information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than,
the principles of this policy. [CLS] [SEP] (check out the list of examples in our
[faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#thirdpartyshareexamplesfaq "privacy
policy/faq").)

if you are visiting wikimedia sites with your mobile device, we use your ip
address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers
regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. [CLS] [SEP]

#### to understand & experiment

  * we give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we also share non-personal information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]
  * when we share information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your information consistent with this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

the open-source software that powers the wikimedia sites depends on the
contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and
testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. [CLS] [SEP] to
facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that
contain your personal information, but only as reasonably necessary for them
to develop and contribute to the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

similarly, we share non-personal information or aggregated information with
researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish
to study the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP] sharing this information helps them understand
usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. [CLS] [SEP] they then can share
their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and
improve the wikimedia sites. [CLS] [SEP]

when we give access to personal information to third-party developers or
researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual
protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your
information consistently with the principles of this policy and in accordance
with our instructions. [CLS] [SEP] if these developers or researchers later publish their
work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and
researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do
we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. [CLS] [SEP] (you can
learn more about re-identification in our
[faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#reidentifiationfaq "privacy policy/faq").)

#### because you made it public

information that you post is public and can been seen and used by everyone. [CLS] [SEP]

any information you post publicly on the wikimedia sites is just that –
public. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that
is public, and not protected by this policy. [CLS] [SEP] and if you edit without
registering or logging into your account, your ip address will be seen
publicly. [CLS] [SEP] please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before
you disclose personal information on your user page or elsewhere. [CLS] [SEP]

### how do we protect your data?

we use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures
to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. [CLS] [SEP]

we strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or
disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] we use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and
procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical
security) designed to protect our systems and your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]
unfortunately, there's no such thing as completely secure data transmission or
storage, so we can't guarantee that our security will not be breached (by
technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). [CLS] [SEP]

we will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary
password via email if you have requested a password reset). [CLS] [SEP] if you ever
receive an email that requests your password, _please let us know by sending
it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email._

### how long do we keep your data?

except as otherwise stated in this policy, we only keep your personal
information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the
wikimedia sites or to comply with u.s. [CLS] [SEP] law. [CLS] [SEP]

once we receive personal information from you, we keep it for the shortest
possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and
improvement of the wikimedia sites, and our obligations under applicable u.s. [CLS] [SEP]
law. [CLS] [SEP] non-personal information may be retained indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP] (check out the
list of examples in our [faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#datatimeexamplesfaq
"privacy policy/faq").)

please remember that certain information, such as your [ip
address](/wiki/privacy_policy/glossary_of_key_terms#internet_protocol_address
"privacy policy/glossary of key terms") (if you edit while not logged in) and
any public contributions to the wikimedia sites, is archived and displayed
indefinitely by design; the transparency of the projects’ contribution and
revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. [CLS] [SEP] to learn
more about our data retention practices, see our [data retention
guidelines](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/data_retention_guidelines). [CLS] [SEP] for
further information about how you may request access to or deletion of your
personal information, or other rights you may have with respect to your
personal information, see our [faq](/wiki/privacy_policy/faq#anonymize
