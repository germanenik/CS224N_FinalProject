# firefox cloud services: terms of service

last updated september 10, 2019

## summary

this top section summarizes the terms below. [CLS] [SEP] this summary is provided to help
your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire document,
because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of the terms,
not just this summary. [CLS] [SEP]

  * firefox cloud services (the "services") are a suite of services provided to you by mozilla. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the services are provided "as is" and there are no warranties of any kind. [CLS] [SEP] there are significant limits on mozilla's liability for any damages arising from your use of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms of service (" _terms_ ") govern your use of firefox cloud
services, a suite of online services provided by mozilla (the "services"). [CLS] [SEP]

  2. [CLS] [SEP] #### firefox accounts

in order to use some of the services, you'll need to create a firefox account. [CLS] [SEP]
during registration, you will be asked to set a password. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible
for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that happens
through your firefox account. [CLS] [SEP] mozilla is not responsible for any losses
arising out of unauthorized use of your firefox account. [CLS] [SEP]

“join firefox” is an offering available in some countries to better experience
the firefox family of products as well as practical privacy and security
knowledge. [CLS] [SEP]

  3. [CLS] [SEP] #### services

(a) firefox screenshots allows you to capture webpage content that can be
viewed later by you or others. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) firefox lockwise lets you access passwords saved to firefox across
devices. [CLS] [SEP] a firefox account is required. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) firefox monitor is an informational service to promote online security by
informing you of public data breaches. [CLS] [SEP] you can scan email addresses on our
website to see most publicly known breaches. [CLS] [SEP] if you subscribe with a firefox
account, you will receive:

    * full report: this includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including breaches of sensitive websites, such as those for children or adult and dating sites (these sites are excluded from website scans in order to protect the privacy of those individuals). [CLS] [SEP] 
    * breach alerts: this notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * safety tips: this sends you occasional online safety tips from mozilla. [CLS] [SEP]

it is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and
different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password
managers, and other safety measures. [CLS] [SEP] although firefox monitor and [have i been
pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) strive to have current data, there is no
guarantee that either will have complete or timely records of all public data
breaches. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) firefox notes lets you take notes in firefox. [CLS] [SEP] a firefox account is

firefox account is required for large file sizes. [CLS] [SEP]

(f) firefox sync lets you access information stored in firefox across devices,
including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser
preferences. [CLS] [SEP] you can enable and disable firefox sync through the tools section
of firefox. [CLS] [SEP] a firefox account is required. [CLS] [SEP]

(g) firefox private network is a proxy service that helps you browse more
privately by placing an intermediary between your firefox browser and the
internet to obfuscate your ip address. [CLS] [SEP] a firefox account is required. [CLS] [SEP]

  4. [CLS] [SEP] #### privacy policy

you hereby represent and warrant that your content will not infringe the
rights of any third party and will comply with any content guidelines

  7. [CLS] [SEP] #### mozilla's proprietary rights

not provide the right to use any of mozilla's copyrights, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
features. [CLS] [SEP] the services are distributed under and subject to the current
version of the [mozilla public license](https://www.mozilla.org/mpl/). [CLS] [SEP]

  8. [CLS] [SEP] #### term; termination

these terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or mozilla. [CLS] [SEP] you
can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deleting your firefox
account, discontinuing your use of the services, and if applicable,
unsubscribing from our emails. [CLS] [SEP]

we may suspend or terminate your access to the services at any time for any
reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have
violated these terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us;
or (iii) our provision of the services to you is no longer commercially
viable. [CLS] [SEP] we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address
associated with your firefox account or the next time you attempt to access
the services. [CLS] [SEP]

in all such cases, these terms shall terminate, including, without limitation,
your license to use the services, except that the following sections shall
continue to apply: indemnification, disclaimer; limitation of liability,
miscellaneous. [CLS] [SEP]

  9. [CLS] [SEP] #### indemnification

you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless mozilla, its contractors,
contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents ("indemnified parties") from and against any
and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising
out of or related to your use of the services (including, but not limited to,
from any content uploaded by you). [CLS] [SEP]

  10. [CLS] [SEP] #### disclaimer; limitation of liability

the services are provided "as is" with all faults. [CLS] [SEP] to the extent permitted by
law, mozilla and the indemnified parties hereby disclaim all warranties,
whether express or implied, including without limitation warranties that the
services are free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, and
non-infringing. [CLS] [SEP] you bear the entire risk as to selecting the services for your
purposes and as to the quality and performance of the services, including
without limitation the risk that your content is deleted or corrupted or that
someone else accesses your online accounts. [CLS] [SEP] this limitation will apply
notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any remedy. [CLS] [SEP] some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties,
so this disclaimer may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

except as required by law, mozilla and the indemnified parties will not be
liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary
damages arising out of or in any way relating to these terms or the use of or
inability to use the services, including without limitation direct and
indirect damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, lost profits, loss of
data, and computer failure or malfunction, even if advised of the possibility
of such damages and regardless of the theory (contract, tort, or otherwise)
upon which such claim is based. [CLS] [SEP] the collective liability of mozilla and the
indemnified parties under this agreement will not exceed $500 (five hundred
dollars). [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental, consequential, or special damages, so this exclusion and
limitation may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

  11. [CLS] [SEP] #### modifications to these terms

mozilla may update these terms from time to time to address a new feature of
the services or to clarify a provision. [CLS] [SEP] the updated terms will be posted
online. [CLS] [SEP] if the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through

  12. [CLS] [SEP] #### miscellaneous

these terms constitute the entire agreement between you and mozilla concerning
the services and are governed by the laws of the state of california, u.s.a.,
excluding its conflict of law provisions. [CLS] [SEP] if any portion of these terms is
held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in
full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] in the event of a conflict between a translated version
