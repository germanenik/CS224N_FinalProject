# user agreement

# paypal user agreement

## about your account

this user agreement will be effective for all users as of february 26, 2021. [CLS] [SEP]

### welcome to paypal!

this user agreement is a contract between you and paypal pte. [CLS] [SEP] ltd., a
singaporean company, governing your use of your paypal account and the paypal
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the

at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of
residence to open a paypal account and use the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a
business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of
one of the countries/regions listed on the [**paypal
worldwide**](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide) page to

terms and conditions in this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree to comply with the
following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page that
apply to you, including:

  * [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full)
  * [alternative payment methods terms](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/apm-tnc)

please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement,
the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to
you. [CLS] [SEP]

we may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from
time to time. [CLS] [SEP] the revised version will be effective at the time we post it on
our website, unless otherwise noted. [CLS] [SEP] if our changes reduce your rights or
increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the [policy
updates](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full) page
of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice. [CLS] [SEP] all future
changes set out in the [policy
updates](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full) page
already published on the legal agreements page at the time you register for
the paypal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and
will take effect as specified in the policy update. [CLS] [SEP]

if you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using
the paypal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with
us without cost or penalty. [CLS] [SEP] this user agreement will continue to apply to your
previous use of our services. [CLS] [SEP]

### about our main business

paypal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting,
maintaining and providing our paypal services to you via the internet. [CLS] [SEP] our
services allow you to send payments to anyone with a paypal account, and,
where available, to receive payments. [CLS] [SEP] our service availability varies by
[country/region](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/residence-full). [CLS] [SEP] you
can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into
your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

the paypal services are offered by paypal pte. [CLS] [SEP] ltd. [CLS] [SEP]

this user agreement is not a solicitation of the paypal services and paypal is
not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

### opening an account

we offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

all paypal accounts let you do things like:

  * send and receive payments. [CLS] [SEP]
  * buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores. [CLS] [SEP]
  * make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, paypal balance, echeque or other payment methods. [CLS] [SEP]
  * accept credit card, debit card, bank account, paypal balance, echeque or other payment methods from others. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and
all ids, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that
you use to access your paypal account and the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to open and maintain a paypal account, you must list your correct
country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account
information, including but not limited to personal information, financial
information, or other information related to you or your business. [CLS] [SEP]

you must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact
information current in your paypal account profile. [CLS] [SEP]

#### personal accounts

if you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and
friends, a personal account is probably right for you. [CLS] [SEP] with a personal account
you can do things like:

  * buy goods and services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * send and request payments from friends and family. [CLS] [SEP]

you can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods
and services, but if you plan to use your paypal account primarily to sell
things, you should consider a business account. [CLS] [SEP] you can convert your paypal
account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances
change. [CLS] [SEP]

#### business accounts

we recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use
paypal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated. [CLS] [SEP]
with a business account, you can do things like:

  * use a company or business name as the name on your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * allow employees access to some of the features of your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * sign up for [paypal products](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/merchant) that meet your business needs. [CLS] [SEP]

business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable
to personal accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

**by opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a
business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a
business or commercial purpose. [CLS] [SEP] you also consent to paypal obtaining your
personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at
account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we
reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with
your business account.**

#### commercial entity agreement

if the activity through any type of paypal account you hold reaches certain
thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are
required by the card networks to agree to a commercial entity agreement to
allow you to continue accepting visa and mastercard payments. [CLS] [SEP] in this case,
these [commercial entity
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/ceagreement-full) will
apply to any payment processed by paypal on your behalf and will form part of
this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### third party permissions

you must be the beneficial owner of your paypal account, and conduct business
only on behalf of yourself. [CLS] [SEP]

you may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties
to take certain actions on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] in some cases, you can do this when
logged into your paypal account - in other cases, you can do this directly
with the third party. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third
party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information
about your paypal account to this third party. [CLS] [SEP]

you may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:

  * provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;
  * confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account; or
  * provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

granting permission to any third party to access your paypal account in any
way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user
agreement. [CLS] [SEP] you are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third
parties to carry out. [CLS] [SEP] you will not hold us responsible for, and you will
indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such
third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your
mandatory legal rights. [CLS] [SEP]

### closing your paypal account

you may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time
without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations
related to your paypal account even after the paypal account is closed. [CLS] [SEP] when
you close your paypal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete
transactions. [CLS] [SEP] you must withdraw or transfer any paypal balance from your
paypal account before closing it. [CLS] [SEP] you cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift
certificates/cards that are purchased through [paypal digital
gifts](https://www.paypal-gifts.com/) and linked to your paypal account as
payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] however, even without your paypal account, you can still use
the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards
to make purchases. [CLS] [SEP]

in certain cases, you may not close your paypal account, including:

  * to evade an investigation. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your paypal account has a negative balance. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your paypal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve. [CLS] [SEP]

### link or unlink a payment method

you can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your
paypal account as a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] please keep your payment method
information current (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] credit card number and expiration date). [CLS] [SEP] if this
information changes, we may update it using information and third party
sources available to us without any action on your part. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want us
to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if we update your payment method, we will keep any preference
setting attached to such payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may choose to confirm your card,
so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner. [CLS] [SEP]

### holding a paypal balance

any paypal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests
those funds in liquid investments. [CLS] [SEP] these pooled amounts are held separate from
paypal's corporate funds, and paypal will neither use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. [CLS] [SEP] you
will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree paypal shall own the interest or other earnings on these
investments. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your
funds to paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

### adding or withdrawing funds

#### adding funds to your balance

you may use the payment methods linked to your paypal account to fund
transactions you make using your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you don't need a paypal
balance to buy something or send payments. [CLS] [SEP] you can add funds your paypal
account from the bank account that's linked to your paypal account by
requesting an electronic transfer to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] the amount
transferred will be held as a balance in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] credit cards
cannot be used to add funds to your paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP]

#### withdrawing funds from your balance

if you have a paypal balance, log into your paypal account to see which of
these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:

  * transferring it to a bank account linked to your paypal account; or
  * transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available; or
  * requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available. [CLS] [SEP]

depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may
be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider. [CLS] [SEP] please
see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions. [CLS] [SEP]

to protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain
situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the
withdrawal or if other payments to your paypal account have been subject to a
reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute
by a buyer). [CLS] [SEP] if we place a limitation on your paypal account, a payment is
subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative
balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your paypal account is
pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or
hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off. [CLS] [SEP]

we may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit
by logging into your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] completing the following steps can help
us verify your paypal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal
cap:

  * verifying your bank account; and
  * linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information. [CLS] [SEP]

we may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP] if your debit
card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your paypal account, you will be
provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your paypal
balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on
the fees for transferring balance (for personal accounts) page and the fees
for transferring balance (for business accounts) page. [CLS] [SEP] the applicable fees
will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP]

generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed
addresses, unless we have verified your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] we will not send
cheques to post office boxes. [CLS] [SEP] if you would like us to send a cheque to an
address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service
and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with
the address. [CLS] [SEP] if you fail to cash a cheque within 180 days of the date of
issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee). [CLS] [SEP]

### managing your balance in multiple currencies

#### holding multiple currencies

your paypal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by paypal,
and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same
time. [CLS] [SEP]

if you hold a balance in your paypal account:

  * we may allow you to convert the balance into another currency. [CLS] [SEP] if you convert the balance in your account, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used. [CLS] [SEP] we may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that paypal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region. [CLS] [SEP] in order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

to receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured
to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your paypal account in
that currency or convert the balance into another currency. [CLS] [SEP] certain currencies
can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that
paypal allows you to hold. [CLS] [SEP] if the balance is converted, paypal's transaction
exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple
currencies in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] you may not manage or convert currencies
for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or
any other activity that paypal determines is primarily for the purpose of
gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may hold,
cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

#### how we convert currency

if paypal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange
rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. [CLS] [SEP] the transaction exchange rate
is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and
retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your
conversion. [CLS] [SEP] the base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale
currency markets on the conversion day or the prior business day; or, if
required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference
rate(s). [CLS] [SEP]

for some uses of your paypal accounts, paypal may determine currency
conversion is necessary. [CLS] [SEP] the currency conversion fee applicable can be found
on our fees page under the heading currency conversion fees. [CLS] [SEP]

#### currency conversion choices

when your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency
conversion by paypal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency
in place of your debit or credit card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] you may have the right to have
your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card
issuer and network. [CLS] [SEP] this currency preference selection may be presented to you
in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the
transaction, whether paypal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or
which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others. [CLS] [SEP] if your card
issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency
conversion rate and the fees they may charge. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your
existing paypal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

### account statements

#### account statements

you have the right to receive an account statement showing your paypal account
activity. [CLS] [SEP] you may view your paypal account statement by logging into your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

# paypal user agreement

## sending payments and buying

### sending payments to or receiving payments from a friend or family member

#### sending payments

in some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member
from your paypal account using the send payments feature in your paypal
account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/p2p payments). [CLS] [SEP]

visit our [available services by country/region of residence
list](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/residence-full) to see which
services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

you can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a
paypal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or
mobile number, in any currency that paypal supports, and you can choose which
payment method you want to use. [CLS] [SEP] if the person to whom you are sending funds
does not have a paypal account, they can claim it by opening a paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
if they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP] receiving funds from a
friend or family member is described under **receiving funds**. [CLS] [SEP]

we may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send,
including funds you send for purchases. [CLS] [SEP] you can view any sending limit by
logging in to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] we may increase your sending limits if you
complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the
removal of withdrawal limits. [CLS] [SEP]

when you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may
happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds. [CLS] [SEP] if they either
decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date
they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be
refunded to:

  * the original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or paypal credit as the payment method, or
  * your paypal balance, if you used your paypal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### receiving payments

if a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your
paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP] to receive funds in a currency your account is not currently
configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency
or convert the funds into another currency. [CLS] [SEP] certain currencies can only be
received by converting the balance into another currency that paypal allows
you to hold. [CLS] [SEP] if the balance is converted, paypal's transaction exchange rate
(including our currency conversion fee) will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

### fees for sending payments to friends and family

the fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our sending funds table
and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction
to send funds to a friend or family member. [CLS] [SEP] if you convert your paypal balance
from one currency to another, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including
our currency conversion fee) will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

if you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-paypal)
website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party
will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee. [CLS] [SEP] this will be disclosed
to you by the third party before the payment is initiated. [CLS] [SEP]

### buying something from, or returning something to, a seller who accepts
paypal

#### how to buy something

you can buy something from a seller who accepts paypal in any currency that
the seller accepts, and that paypal supports, using the funds in your paypal
balance, or using any payment method linked to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] this
includes, for example:

  * buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting paypal as your payment method at checkout. [CLS] [SEP]
  * sending a payment to a seller for good or services. [CLS] [SEP]
  * using your paypal account to buy something at a seller's physical store. [CLS] [SEP]

if the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does
not already have a paypal account, they can claim your payment by opening a
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if they don't open a paypal account within 30 days, your
purchase will be refunded. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to manage risk, paypal may limit the payment methods available for a
transaction when you buy something. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, payment methods may be
limited for certain sellers or if you make a paypal payment through certain
third-party websites or applications, for example:

  * american express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;
  * some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry; and
  * credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your paypal balance

when you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts paypal, some sellers may
take up to 30 days to complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] in these instances, your
payment may appear as a pending order in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] in that case,
your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes
the transaction (but no longer than 30 days). [CLS] [SEP] if you used a debit or credit
card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a
pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or
receive a completed transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

if your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange
rate will be determined and applied as described in the how we convert
currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### fees

when you buy something from a seller who accepts paypal, you don't pay a fee
to paypal. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal performs a currency conversion for your purchase,
paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee)
will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for
transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

#### payment review

when paypal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the
transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed. [CLS] [SEP] when this happens,
paypal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay
shipping of the item. [CLS] [SEP] as a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you
purchased. [CLS] [SEP] if we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct
them to ship the item. [CLS] [SEP] if we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it
and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other
action. [CLS] [SEP]

#### automatic payments

you can agree with a seller who accepts paypal to use paypal as the payment
method for future purchases with that seller. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement is between you
and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your paypal account
with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis. [CLS] [SEP] examples of
automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with
paypal include those that paypal calls a "billing agreement," "subscription,"
"recurring payment," "reference transaction," "preauthorized debit or pad",
"preauthorized transfer" or "preapproved payment."

you may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 business days before the date of
the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us
through the [paypal help centre](https://www.paypal.com/sg/smarthelp/home). [CLS] [SEP]
once an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under
your agreement with that seller will be stopped. [CLS] [SEP] if you cancel an automatic
payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have
additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you
receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller
through alternative means. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to paypal, that
permits a seller to take or receive payments from your paypal account on a
regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine
billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right
to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at
least 10 days before the transfer is made. [CLS] [SEP] if the seller provides the option,
you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your
automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the
seller. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have authorized an automatic payment and paypal performs a currency
conversion for an automatic payment transaction, paypal will use the
transaction exchange rate (including paypal's currency conversion fee) in
effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### refunds

when you buy something from a seller online using paypal and the transaction
is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original
payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit
card or paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP] if you used a bank account as the payment method for
the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your
paypal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account. [CLS] [SEP] for purchases you
make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your paypal account
and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to
your paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP]

if paypal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is
issued:

  * within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply. [CLS] [SEP]
  * beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply. [CLS] [SEP] the transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] this means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates. [CLS] [SEP]

payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to
refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency. [CLS] [SEP]

### payment method used for my transaction

#### selecting a preferred payment method

in certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your paypal
account as your preferred payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you can select a preferred payment
method in your account preferences. [CLS] [SEP] there may be times when your preferred
payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that
is expired. [CLS] [SEP]

you can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-
store transactions and automatic payments with a seller. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary
method of payment. [CLS] [SEP]

the availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that
particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the
transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

if you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment
method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including
the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] you can also click on the "manage" link to see all of your
available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method
during the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

#### backup payment method

certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method
be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is
unavailable. [CLS] [SEP] in those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to
you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] note
that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for
automatic payments. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal determines currency conversion is necessary for
a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able
to separately choose whether paypal or your card issuer performs the currency
conversion on your backup payment method. [CLS] [SEP]

#### sending payments to friends and family

when you send payments to friends and family using your paypal balance (if
available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you
these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method
for your online purchases. [CLS] [SEP] remember, you always have the choice to select any
payment method in your paypal account by clicking the "change" link on the
send payments page. [CLS] [SEP] if you select a payment method with a fee, we will always
show you the fee before you send the payment. [CLS] [SEP]

#### automatic payments

some sellers allow you to store paypal as the way to pay when making purchases
on their site, so you can check out faster. [CLS] [SEP] often, this entails creating an
agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your
paypal account each time you make a purchase. [CLS] [SEP]

you can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller
either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always
charge your credit card for the monthly cost. [CLS] [SEP]

if your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] credit card expired), a
particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify
a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future
transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following
order, as applicable: 1. [CLS] [SEP] balance; 2. [CLS] [SEP] bank account (instant transfer); 3. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal co-branded debit card; 4. [CLS] [SEP] paypal co-branded credit card; 5. [CLS] [SEP] debit card;
6. [CLS] [SEP] credit card; and 7. [CLS] [SEP] echeque. [CLS] [SEP]

you can cancel any agreement in your account settings. [CLS] [SEP]

#### bank account transfers

when you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing paypal to
initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] for these
transactions, paypal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in
the amount you specify. [CLS] [SEP] you authorize paypal to try this transfer again if the
initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason. [CLS] [SEP]

#### echeque

echeque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment
method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction
is processed from the bank. [CLS] [SEP] this process usually takes 3-5 business days, but
this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account
located outside of your country/region. [CLS] [SEP]

if echeque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your
paypal payment, even if you have a balance. [CLS] [SEP]

### paypal’s buyer protection program

#### paypal's buyer protection

when you buy something from a seller who accepts paypal, you may be eligible
for a refund under paypal's buyer protection program. [CLS] [SEP] when applicable,
paypal's buyer protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full
purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for
the buyer protection program. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's original determination is considered
final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with paypal if
you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the
original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-
making process. [CLS] [SEP]

**important:** you may be required to return the item to the seller or other
party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's buyer
protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return
shipping costs that you may incur. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's buyer protection program may apply when you encounter these specific
problems with a transaction:

  * you didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an "item not received" claim), or
  * you received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a "significantly not as described" claim). [CLS] [SEP]

if you believe that a transaction made through your paypal account was not
authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the buyer protection
program, and is described below under liability for unauthorized transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

#### item not received claims

your claim _will not_ qualify for a refund under paypal's buyer protection
program for an item not received claim if:

  * you collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use paypal in a seller's store location, or

  * the seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]

if the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address,
paypal may find in favor of the seller for an item not received claim even if
you claim you did not receive the goods. [CLS] [SEP]

#### significantly not as described claims

an item may be considered significantly not as described if:

  * the item is materially different from the seller's description of it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you received a completely different item. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the condition of the item was misrepresented. [CLS] [SEP] for example, the item was described as "new" but the item was used. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] it is counterfeit). [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was materially damaged during shipment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such. [CLS] [SEP]

an item may not be considered significantly not as described if:

  * the item is materially similar to the seller's description of it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item was properly described but did not meet your expectations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item has minor scratches and was described as "used."

#### ineligible items and transactions

the following items or transactions **_are not_** eligible for paypal's buyer
protection program:

  * real estate, including residential property
  * vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards
  * businesses (when you buy or invest in a business)
  * industrial machinery used in manufacturing
  * payments that are equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards
  * payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or exchange-traded form)
  * financial products or investments of any kind
  * gambling, gaming, and/or any other activities with an entry fee and a prize
  * donations, including payments on crowdfunding platforms as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms
  * payments to a state-run body (except for state-owned enterprises), government agencies or third-parties acting on behalf of state-run bodies or government agencies
  * payments to any bill payment service
  * **significantly not as described** claims for wholly or partly custom-made items
  * item not received claims for physical, tangible items you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] this includes items bought in a seller's store location, except if you paid for the transaction in-person using paypal's goods and services qr code
  * anything prohibited by paypal's [**acceptable use policy**](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full)
  * payments made using paypal's payouts and mass pay
  * personal payments, including payments sent using paypal's friends and family functionality
  * payments that you have not sent using your paypal account
  * items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items

#### transaction eligibility for paypal's buyer protection program

to be eligible for paypal's buyer protection you must meet all of the
following requirements:

  * have a paypal account in good standing. [CLS] [SEP]
  * pay for the eligible item from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under paypal’s purchase protection through the resolution center. [CLS] [SEP]
  * respond to paypal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested. [CLS] [SEP] 
  * open a dispute in the resolution centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP]
  * not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source. [CLS] [SEP]

#### our online dispute resolution process

if you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a
seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the
[resolution centre](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-
view&nav=0.4) to pursue a claim under our buyer protection program. [CLS] [SEP] you may
also file a claim (step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent. [CLS] [SEP] the
steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these
steps your claim may be denied:

**step 1:** **open a dispute** within 180 days of the date you made the
payment. [CLS] [SEP] this might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller
regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP]
if you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to
step 2. [CLS] [SEP] we will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the
seller's paypal account until the dispute is resolved or closed. [CLS] [SEP]

**step 2:** **escalate the dispute to a claim** for reimbursement within 20
days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an
agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] you can escalate the
dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the [resolution
centre](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4). [CLS] [SEP]
the seller or paypal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to
escalate the dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

**step 3:** **respond to paypal's requests for documentation or other
information** , after you, the seller or paypal escalates your dispute to a
claim for reimbursement. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may require you to provide receipts, third
party evaluations, police reports or other documents that paypal specifies. [CLS] [SEP]
you must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our
correspondence with you. [CLS] [SEP]

**step 4:** **comply with paypal's shipping requests in a timely manner** , if
you're filing a significantly not as described claim. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may require you,
at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to paypal or to a third
party (which will be specified by paypal) and to provide proof of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]

#### proof of delivery means:

for transactions that total less than $750 usd (or the equivalent currency
threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and
includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery
date, and the identity of the shipping company you used. [CLS] [SEP]

for transactions that total $750 usd (or the equivalent currency threshold in
the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery
(except for buyers having a paypal account registered: in albania, andorra,
bosnia and herzegovina, croatia, iceland, israel, or ukraine to whom such
requirement won't apply). [CLS] [SEP] if the transaction is in a currency not listed in
the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds
the equivalent of $750 usd at the paypal exchange rate that applies at the
time the transaction is processed. [CLS] [SEP]

**step 5: paypal will make a final decision** (including automatically closing
any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the eligibility
requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the
online dispute resolution process or any other information paypal deems
relevant and appropriate under the circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

note that when you are making digital goods micropayments purchases, there are
special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we
may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take
further action. [CLS] [SEP] we may limit the number of automatic reversals that you
benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow
paypal's standard dispute resolution processes described above. [CLS] [SEP]

in the event that paypal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or
seller, each party must comply with paypal's decision. [CLS] [SEP]

if paypal finds in favour of a buyer, paypal will reimburse the buyer for the
full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs. [CLS] [SEP]

in a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the paypal
fees associated with the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

if a seller loses a significantly not as described claim due to the item sold
being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the
buyer and you will not receive the item back. [CLS] [SEP]

#### dispute with us or your card issuer

if you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a
transaction through your paypal account and you are dissatisfied with the
transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card
issuer. [CLS] [SEP] applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available
to you under paypal's buyer protection program. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you dispute a
transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid
for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a
significantly not as described claim with us. [CLS] [SEP]

you must choose whether to pursue a dispute with paypal under our buyer
protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] you can't
do both at the same time or seek a double recovery. [CLS] [SEP] if you pursue a
dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction
with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us. [CLS] [SEP] this won't
affect the dispute process with your card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you pursue a
dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us
later. [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to dispute a transaction with paypal and we decide against you,
you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal does
not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's
deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than
the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer,
we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you
have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer). [CLS] [SEP] before contacting
your card issuer or filing a dispute with paypal, you should contact the
seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

# paypal user agreement

## selling and accepting payments

### accepting payments from buyers for goods and services

#### receiving personal payments

the ability to receive payments varies by country/region. [CLS] [SEP] you can determine
whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your paypal
account. [CLS] [SEP]

if you use your paypal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or
services or accept donations, you must:

  * pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds. [CLS] [SEP]
  * not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase. [CLS] [SEP] if you do so, paypal may remove your paypal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members. [CLS] [SEP]

by integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended
to enable a payer without a paypal account to send a payment to your paypal
account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which
paypal will make available to you on any page on the paypal or braintree
website (including any page for developers and our [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page) or
online platform. [CLS] [SEP] such further terms include the paypal [alternative payment
methods terms](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/apm-tnc). [CLS] [SEP]

#### no surcharges

you agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting
paypal as a payment method. [CLS] [SEP] you may charge a handling fee in connection with
the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as
a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-paypal
transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

#### presentation of paypal

you must treat paypal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other
payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever paypal’s branded
services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications. [CLS] [SEP] this
includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point
of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions,
restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment
methods at your points of sale. [CLS] [SEP] further, you must not present any payment
method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience)
from the presentment of any of paypal’s services or marks. [CLS] [SEP]

in representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not
mischaracterize any paypal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference
for other payment methods over any paypal service. [CLS] [SEP] within all of your points
of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using
paypal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method. [CLS] [SEP] if you
enable your customers to pay you with paypal, whenever you display or exhibit
the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in
your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you
agree to display the paypal services payment marks at least as prominently,
and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods. [CLS] [SEP]

#### taxes, information reporting

some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar
governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax,
income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction
(collectively, "taxes") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of
applicable taxes. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes
apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your
responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the
appropriate authority. [CLS] [SEP] paypal is not responsible for determining whether any
taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or
remitting taxes arising from any transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

#### your refund policy and privacy policy

you must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy,
where required by law. [CLS] [SEP]

#### payment review

paypal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. [CLS] [SEP] if paypal
determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place
a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item. [CLS] [SEP]
paypal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment. [CLS] [SEP] if the
payment is completed, paypal will provide notice to you to ship the item. [CLS] [SEP]
otherwise, paypal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to
the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action. [CLS] [SEP] all payments
that complete this payment review will be eligible for paypal's seller
protection program if they meet paypal's seller protection program
requirements. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you by email and/or through your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### in-store payments

if you accept paypal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the
total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place. [CLS] [SEP] you may
charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have
authorized. [CLS] [SEP] you must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they
request one. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any transaction that you make shall have an
accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased. [CLS] [SEP]

#### marketplace sellers

if you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where
paypal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the
marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for
sales you make through that forum. [CLS] [SEP] any such protections may require you to
take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### card not present transactions

whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a
transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the
transaction will be processed as a "card not present" transaction, even if the
buyer is at your store location. [CLS] [SEP]

#### accepting preauthorized payments

as a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through
preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis. [CLS] [SEP] this
type of transaction is sometimes called a "billing agreement," "subscription,"
"recurring payment," "reference transaction," "preauthorized debit or pad",
"preauthorized transfer, "pre-approved payment " or "automatic payment."

if you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:  
  
---  
  
you must:

|

you must not:  
  
get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration
of any such payment. [CLS] [SEP]

|

restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer
has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if
buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 business days
before the date scheduled for payment. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each
preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the
preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an
amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
#### automatic transfer countries

if you are a resident of an automatic transfer country, then you have the
ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your
payment through an available withdrawal method. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not do so, the
amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your paypal account to your
withdrawal method on a regular basis. [CLS] [SEP] for additional terms regarding automatic
transfer, please click [here. [CLS] [SEP]

### transaction fees for online and in-store payments

#### standard transactions fees

your paypal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region. [CLS] [SEP] the fees
you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their paypal
account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the commercial
payments fees table. [CLS] [SEP] please note that:

  * we may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using paypal. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you accept payments using a paypal product (like paypal payments pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions. [CLS] [SEP]

#### merchant rate

to qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have
a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good
standing. [CLS] [SEP] to view merchant rate criteria click
[here](https://www.paypal.com/businesswallet/fees/paypal-fees). [CLS] [SEP]

#### micropayments fees

you may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and
services through your paypal account, if your transactions typically average
less than $10 usd. [CLS] [SEP] in order to qualify, you must have a paypal account that is
in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative paypal balance), you
may not be processing payments using paypal payments pro and you must submit
an application and have it approved by us. [CLS] [SEP]

if your paypal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees
found on the **micropayment fees table** will apply to all transactions for
the sale of goods or services processed through your paypal account, instead
of the commercial payments fees. [CLS] [SEP] if you have multiple paypal accounts, you
must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account. [CLS] [SEP]
once a transaction is processed, paypal will not re-route the transaction
through a different account. [CLS] [SEP]

by applying for micropayments for digital goods, you agree that for digital
goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the **table**, then if a
buyer opens a dispute, paypal may reverse the transaction, and remove the
funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to
a claim. [CLS] [SEP]

#### paypal payouts and mass pay fees

you can use paypal's payouts and mass pay services to send payouts to multiple
recipients in one batch, such as commissions, rebates, rewards, incentives and
bulk business payments. [CLS] [SEP] in order to use these services, you must have:

  * a paypal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits; and
  * applied for and received our permission to use these services. [CLS] [SEP]

the amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you
use the payouts service or mass pay services, how you send the payments, and
the currency of the payment. [CLS] [SEP] these fees can be found on the **fees page**. [CLS] [SEP]

if an intended payout recipient does not have a paypal account, they can claim
the payout by opening one. [CLS] [SEP] any payouts that are not claimed by the intended
recipient within 30 days will be refunded to you. [CLS] [SEP] we are not liable for
amounts sent in error through the payouts or mass pay services, and we will
have no responsibility to reverse any payouts. [CLS] [SEP]

the payouts and mass pay services may only be used for multiple or bulk
payments. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to make individual payments, please use the paypal
services intended for that purpose. [CLS] [SEP] mass pay and payouts services may not be
used for payroll, selling products, sending money to family and friends,
paying a merchant for a purchase, purchasing unlock codes, or for any use that
we determine presents a higher than acceptable level of risk. [CLS] [SEP] we may add
further restrictions at any time in our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

you are solely responsible for ensuring that each of your payouts and mass pay
recipients has opted in to receive payments from you through the applicable
services and has agreed to be contacted by email or text message, as
applicable. [CLS] [SEP] by using the mass pay and payouts services, you represent and
warrant that the emails or phone numbers you use to contact your customers
were provided to you by each payout recipient, and that your use of the
services to contact your customers complies with applicable laws and
regulations. [CLS] [SEP] you understand that the payouts and mass pay services are only
intended to facilitate bulk payments and transactions and may not be used to
send marketing messages for your business. [CLS] [SEP]

without limiting our other rights and remedies under this user agreement, we
may, in our sole discretion, at any time suspend or terminate your access to
the payouts or mass pay services or your paypal account if we determine (i)
you are misusing the paypal or mass pay services, (ii) there is a higher than
acceptable level of risk associated with your use of the paypal or mass pay
services, or (iii) you have violated any of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### refunds, reversals and chargebacks

#### general information

if you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded
or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the
payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or
dispute fee described below). [CLS] [SEP] whenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise
reversed, paypal will refund or reverse the transaction from your paypal
account in the same currency as the original transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if your paypal
balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a
refund or reversal, paypal will perform a currency conversion in order to
refund or reverse the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] paypal's transaction exchange rate
(including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is
processed will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

if you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a
donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid
as the seller will not be returned to you. [CLS] [SEP] (this will not apply to residents
of mainland china who open a paypal account and use the paypal services.)

the buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a
portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain
the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded
payment will be deducted from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### payments that are invalidated and reversed

payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by paypal if:

  * you lose a paypal buyer protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for paypal's seller protection. [CLS] [SEP] the card issuer, not paypal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required. [CLS] [SEP]
  * ebay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out). [CLS] [SEP]
  * our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent. [CLS] [SEP]
  * paypal sent the payment to you in error. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the payment was unauthorized. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, paypal's [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full) or any other agreement between you and paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

when you receive a payment, you are liable to paypal for the full amount of
the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for
any reason. [CLS] [SEP] if the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the
payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using paypal's
transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time
the refund or reversal is processed. [CLS] [SEP] if your paypal balance is insufficient to
cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will
result in a negative paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP] any negative paypal balance represents an
amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add
funds to your paypal balance to eliminate it. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not do so, paypal may:

  * recover any amounts due to paypal by debiting your balance;
  * engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;
  * take any and all action as outlined under amounts owed to paypal; or
  * place a limitation or take other action on your paypal account as outlined under restricted activities and holds. [CLS] [SEP]

#### dispute fees

paypal will charge a **dispute fee** to sellers for facilitating the online
dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through
a buyer's paypal account or through a paypal guest checkout **.** the
**dispute fee** applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with paypal, a
chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank. [CLS] [SEP] the
**dispute fee **will be charged at either the **standard dispute fee** rate or
the **high volume dispute fee** rate. [CLS] [SEP] the **dispute fee **will be charged in
the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing. [CLS] [SEP] if the
transaction was in a currency not listed in the **dispute fee **table, the fee
charged will be in your primary holding currency. [CLS] [SEP] the **dispute fee **will be
deducted from your paypal account after the claim is decided. [CLS] [SEP]

the **dispute fee** amount will be determined when the dispute is created. [CLS] [SEP] the
fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of all **item not
received** and **significantly not as described** claims you receive compared
to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months. [CLS] [SEP] your
total claims include all item not received and significantly not as described
claims that are filed either directly with and escalated to paypal or with the
buyer's card issuer or bank. [CLS] [SEP] your total claims do not include claims for
unauthorized transactions. [CLS] [SEP] for example, for the month of september, your
disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales
ratio over june, july and august. [CLS] [SEP] the claims ratio for september will
determine the dispute fee for all claims filed in october. [CLS] [SEP]

if your disputes ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales
transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged
the **high volume dispute fee** for each dispute. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, you will be
charged the **standard dispute fee** for each dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

you will **_not_** be charged a **standard dispute fee** for disputes that are
_:_

  * inquiries in paypal's [**resolution center**](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4) that are not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * filed by the buyer directly with paypal as an **unauthorized transaction**. [CLS] [SEP]
  * eligible for **paypal 's seller protection** program. [CLS] [SEP]
  * claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a **standard dispute fee.**
  * decided in your favour by paypal or your issuer. [CLS] [SEP]

you will **_not_** be charged a **high volume dispute fee** for disputes that
are:

  * inquiries in paypal's [**resolution center**](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4) and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with paypal. [CLS] [SEP]
  * filed by the buyer directly with paypal as an **unauthorized transaction**. [CLS] [SEP]

sellers charged **high volume dispute fees** may be required to provide a
remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased
dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for
those actions. [CLS] [SEP]

disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a **standard dispute
fee** or a **high volume dispute fee** , but the claim itself may still be
included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio. [CLS] [SEP]

#### chargeback fees

for transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s paypal
account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback
for the transaction with their card issuer, paypal will charge you a
chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process. [CLS] [SEP] this fee will apply
regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with
the card issuer. [CLS] [SEP]

the applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] the
chargeback fee is the amount specified on the chargeback fees table in the
currency of the original transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if the transaction was in a currency not
listed in the chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary
holding currency. [CLS] [SEP]

if a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not paypal, will determine who
wins the chargeback. [CLS] [SEP] the chargeback fee is applied as specified in the
chargeback fee table in the currency of the original transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if the
transaction is in a currency not listed in the chargeback fee table the fee
assessed in your primary holding currency. [CLS] [SEP]

#### impact of various buyer protection processes on sellers

you should read and understand paypal's buyer protection program and if you
sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with paypal
accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar
with paypal's buyer protection available to buyers in each of those
countries/regions. [CLS] [SEP] buyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a
seller. [CLS] [SEP] you can find this information for paypal's programs on the [legal
agreements](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full) page by
selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the
applicable user agreement for that geography. [CLS] [SEP]

if you lose a claim under paypal's buyer protection program in any
country/region:

  * you will be required to reimburse paypal for your liability. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the paypal fees that you were charged for the transaction. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you will not receive a refund of the paypal fees that you paid in connection with the sale. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the claim was that the item received was significantly not as described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the claim was that the item received was significantly not as described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back. [CLS] [SEP]

if you accept paypal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell
through ebay, then you need to read and understand the ebay money back
guarantee program. [CLS] [SEP] unless you opt out by calling ebay, paypal will treat
ebay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for
reversing a paypal payment made to you. [CLS] [SEP] if your paypal balance is insufficient
to cover the amount, we may:

  * place a hold on your paypal account until sufficient funds become available in your paypal account to cover such claim; or
  * create a negative balance in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

### paypal's seller protection program

#### what's eligible

if you sell a good or service to a buyer, you may be eligible for paypal's
seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP] when it applies, paypal's seller protection program
entitles you to retain the full purchase amount. [CLS] [SEP] there is no limit on the
number of payments eligible for paypal's seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP] by
accessing the transaction details page in your paypal account you can
determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under
this program. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's seller protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:

  * they did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their paypal account (referred to as an " **unauthorized transaction**" and the unauthorized transaction occurs in an environment hosted by paypal; or
  * they did not receive the item from you (referred to as an " **item not received**" claim). [CLS] [SEP]

paypal's seller protection program may also apply when a transaction is
reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded
payment is reversed by the buyer's bank. [CLS] [SEP]

this section describes paypal's seller protection program as it applies to
you, but you should also be familiar with the **impact of various buyer
protection processes on sellers**. [CLS] [SEP]

#### basic requirements

to be eligible for paypal's seller protection program, all of the following
basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional
requirements:

  * you provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in the case of an unauthorized transaction claim, you must provide valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery that demonstrates that the item was shipped or provided to the buyer no later than two days after paypal notified you of the dispute or reversal. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if paypal notifies you of an unauthorized transaction claim on september 1, the valid proof of shipment must indicate that the item was shipped to the buyer no later than september 3 to be eligible for paypal’s seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP]
  * the item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the intangible goods additional requirements. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your paypal account for the transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for paypal's seller protection. [CLS] [SEP] we therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must respond to paypal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the [resolution centre](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4). [CLS] [SEP] if you do not respond to paypal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for paypal's seller protection. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must accept payment from a paypal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded). [CLS] [SEP]
  * the payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of unauthorized transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of item not received claims, for paypal's seller protection on the transaction details page. [CLS] [SEP] 

paypal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for
paypal's seller protection program. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will make a decision, in its sole
discretion, based on the eligibility requirements, any information or
documentation provided during the resolution process, or any other information
paypal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

#### item not received additional requirements

to be eligible for paypal's seller protection program for a buyer's item not
received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional
requirements listed below:

  * where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked "eligible" or "partially eligible" for paypal's seller protection on the transaction details page. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you must provide proof of delivery as described below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### intangible goods additional requirements

for the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for paypal’s
seller protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following
additional requirements:

  * integration requirements:
    * where you have integrated a paypal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website; or
    * ensure you are passing session information to paypal at checkout if you are integrated with paypal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration. [CLS] [SEP]
    * other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model. [CLS] [SEP] we will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed. [CLS] [SEP]
  * paid standard transaction fees on the sale. [CLS] [SEP]
  * delivered the item and provide proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods. [CLS] [SEP]
  * provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table. [CLS] [SEP] if the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 usd at the paypal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed. [CLS] [SEP]

#### establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment

### actions we may take if you engage in any restricted activities

if we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a
number of actions to protect paypal, its customers and others at any time in
our sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the actions we may take include, but are not limited to,
the following:

  * terminate this user agreement, limit your paypal account, and/or close or suspend your paypal account, immediately and without penalty to us;
  * refuse to provide the paypal services to you now and in the future;
  * limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the paypal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your paypal account or any of the paypal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send payments with any of the payment methods linked to your paypal account, restricting your ability to send payments or make withdrawals;
  * hold your paypal balance if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to paypal or a third party, or if you have violated our [acceptable use policy](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full);
  * suspend your eligibility for paypal's buyer protection program and/or paypal's seller protection program;

[CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that $2,500 usd (or equivalent) per violation of the acceptable use policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of paypal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to paypal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the acceptable use policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may deduct such damages directly from any existing paypal balance in any paypal account you control. [CLS] [SEP]

if we close your paypal account or terminate your use of the paypal services
for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any
unrestricted funds held in your paypal account available for withdrawal. [CLS] [SEP]

you are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines,
penalties and other liability incurred by paypal, any paypal customer, or a
third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this user agreement,
and/or your use of the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP]

### holds, limitations and reserves

#### what are holds, limitations and reserves

under certain circumstances, in order to protect paypal and the security and
integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the paypal services,
paypal may take account-level or transaction-level actions. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise
noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with
notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these
actions. [CLS] [SEP] to request information in connection with an account limitation, hold
or reserve, you should visit the resolution centre or follow the instructions
in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve. [CLS] [SEP]

our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on
confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the
protection of paypal, our customers and/or service providers. [CLS] [SEP] we may use
proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with
your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a
governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such
decisions. [CLS] [SEP] we have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk
management or security procedures to you. [CLS] [SEP]

in order to facilitate paypal's actions described above and allow us to assess
the level of risk associated with your paypal account, you agree to cooperate
with paypal's reasonable requests for financial statements and other
documentation or information in a timely fashion. [CLS] [SEP]

#### holds

a hold is an action that paypal may take under certain circumstances either at
the transaction level or the account level. [CLS] [SEP] when paypal places a temporary
hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or
the recipient. [CLS] [SEP] paypal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment,
including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer
disputes, and overall customer satisfaction. [CLS] [SEP] some common situations where
paypal will hold payments include:

  * new sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity. [CLS] [SEP]
  * payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets. [CLS] [SEP]
  * sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

#### holds based on paypal’s risk decisions

we may place a hold on payments sent to your paypal account if, in our sole
discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with
you, your paypal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is
necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. [CLS] [SEP] we make decisions about
whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including
information available to us from both internal sources and third parties. [CLS] [SEP] when
we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your paypal account
with an indication that they are unavailable or pending. [CLS] [SEP] we'll notify you,
either through your paypal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we
place a hold. [CLS] [SEP]

risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the
payment was received into your paypal account unless paypal has a reason to
continue to hold the payment. [CLS] [SEP] we may release the hold earlier under certain
circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information
related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole
discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged
as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed
transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below. [CLS] [SEP] in this case, we'll
hold the payment in your paypal account until the matter is resolved. [CLS] [SEP]

#### holds related to marketplace transactions

if you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where
paypal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the
instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party. [CLS] [SEP] this is done once
you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in
accordance with your agreement with the third-party. [CLS] [SEP] these holds will appear
in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] if you have questions about why the applicable
marketplace or third party instructed paypal to put these holds in place, you
will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly. [CLS] [SEP]

#### holds based on disputed transactions

if a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be
invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your
paypal account to cover the amount that could be reversed. [CLS] [SEP] any of the
situations described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks are situations
that could result in us placing a hold on a payment. [CLS] [SEP] if we determine the
transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold. [CLS] [SEP] if we
determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your
paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### account limitations

limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your paypal
account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments. [CLS] [SEP] these limitations
are implemented to help protect paypal, buyers and sellers when we notice
restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears
to us as unusual or suspicious. [CLS] [SEP] limitations also help us collect information
necessary for keeping your paypal account open. [CLS] [SEP]

there are several reasons why we may limit your access to your paypal account
or the paypal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:

  * if we suspect someone could be using your paypal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission. [CLS] [SEP] similarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your paypal account and your bank account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * in order to comply with applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the acceptable use policy. [CLS] [SEP]
  * seller performance indicating your paypal account is high risk. [CLS] [SEP] examples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly. [CLS] [SEP]

if we limit access to your paypal account, we'll provide you with notice of
our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our
sole discretion, we deem it appropriate. [CLS] [SEP]

you will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can
be removed. [CLS] [SEP] normally, this is done after you provide us with the information
we request. [CLS] [SEP] however, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you
have provided us that information, we may take action to protect paypal, our
users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal
and/or regulatory risks and any other liability. [CLS] [SEP]

#### reserves

we may place a reserve on your paypal account if we believe there may be a
high level of risk associated with you, your paypal account, your business
model, or your transactions. [CLS] [SEP] when we place a reserve on your paypal account,
it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as "pending" in
your paypal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a "pending"
status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being
reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your paypal account or
use of the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] we make decisions about whether to place a reserve
based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both
internal sources and from third parties. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these
factors have changed over time, including:

  * how long you have been in business. [CLS] [SEP]
  * whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your payment processing history with paypal and other providers. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your business and/or personal credit history. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your delivery time frames. [CLS] [SEP]
  * whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes. [CLS] [SEP]

if we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our
actions and the terms of the reserve. [CLS] [SEP]

there are two types of reserves that may be placed on your paypal account, and
one or both may be applied at the same time:

  * **a rolling reserve** is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis. [CLS] [SEP] for example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc. [CLS] [SEP] rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve. [CLS] [SEP]
  * **a minimum reserve** is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your paypal balance at all times. [CLS] [SEP] the minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve. [CLS] [SEP] 

if we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment,
we'll notify you of the new terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### court orders, regulatory requirements or other legal process

if we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including
garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise
believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or
regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including
holding payments to/from your paypal account, placing a reserve or limitation
on your paypal account, or releasing your funds. [CLS] [SEP] we will decide, in our sole
discretion, which action is required of us. [CLS] [SEP] unless the court order, applicable
law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will
notify you of these actions. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have an obligation to contest or appeal
any court order or legal process involving you or your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP] when we
implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order,
applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold,
reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as
determined by paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

# paypal user agreement

## liability for unauthorized transactions

### protection from unauthorized transactions

to protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your paypal account, you
should regularly log into your paypal account and review your paypal account
statement. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to
your primary email address on file. [CLS] [SEP] you should review these transaction
notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately
completed. [CLS] [SEP]

paypal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
when this protection applies, paypal will cover you for the full amount of the
unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the
procedures described below. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what is an unauthorized transaction

an "unauthorized transaction" occurs when a payment is sent from your paypal
account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. [CLS] [SEP] for example,
if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your paypal
account, and sends a payment from your paypal account, an unauthorized
transaction has occurred. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what is not considered an unauthorized transaction

the following are not considered unauthorized transactions:

  * if you give someone access to your paypal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your paypal account without your knowledge or permission. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for transactions made in this situation. [CLS] [SEP]
  * invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]

#### reporting an unauthorized transaction

you should contact [paypal customer
service](https://www.paypal.com/sg/smarthelp/contact-us) immediately if you
believe:

  * there has been an unauthorized transaction sent from your account;
  * there has been unauthorized access to your account;
  * your paypal login information has been lost or stolen; or
  * any device you have used to access your paypal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated. [CLS] [SEP]

you must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of
any unauthorized transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of
your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist paypal in its
investigation. [CLS] [SEP]

if you notify us of an unauthorized transaction within 60 days of the
transaction and we are satisfied that it was an unauthorized transaction, you
will be eligible for 100% protection for the unauthorized transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

### error resolution

#### what is an error

an "error" means the following:

  * a processing error made by paypal or its suppliers in which your paypal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]
  * a transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your paypal account statement. [CLS] [SEP]
  * we make a computational or mathematical error related to your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

#### what is not considered an error

the following are not considered errors:

  * if you give someone access to your paypal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your paypal account without your knowledge or permission. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for transactions made in this situation. [CLS] [SEP]
  * invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under refunds, reversals and chargebacks. [CLS] [SEP]
  * if you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example). [CLS] [SEP] (your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)

#### in case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers

contact us at our [resolution centre](https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-
bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&nav=0.4). [CLS] [SEP]

notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong
or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or
receipt. [CLS] [SEP] we must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the first
statement on which the problem or error appeared. [CLS] [SEP]

  * tell us your name, email address and account number (if any). [CLS] [SEP]
  * describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information. [CLS] [SEP]
  * tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. [CLS] [SEP]

if you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or
question in writing within 10 business days. [CLS] [SEP] we will complete our
investigation within 10 business days after we receive your notification of
the suspected error. [CLS] [SEP] if we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days
to investigate your complaint or question. [CLS] [SEP] if we decide to do this, we will
credit your paypal account within 10 business days for the amount you think is
in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it
takes us to complete our investigation. [CLS] [SEP] we will notify you of the provisional
credit within 2 business days of the crediting. [CLS] [SEP] if we ask you to put your
complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business
days, we may not provisionally credit your paypal account. [CLS] [SEP]

for errors involving new paypal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or
foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your
complaint or question. [CLS] [SEP] for new paypal accounts (the first transaction from
your account was less than 30 business days from the date you notify us), we
may take up to 20 business days to complete the investigation. [CLS] [SEP]

we will tell you the results within 3 business days after completing our
investigation. [CLS] [SEP] if we decide that there was no error, we will send you a
written explanation of our decision. [CLS] [SEP] if you received a provisional credit, we
will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the
debit. [CLS] [SEP] you may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our
investigation. [CLS] [SEP]

if we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full
amount into your account within 1 business day of our determination. [CLS] [SEP] or, if
you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain
those amounts. [CLS] [SEP]

### processing errors

we will rectify any processing error that we discover. [CLS] [SEP] if the error results
in:

  * you receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your paypal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received. [CLS] [SEP]
  * you receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your paypal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received. [CLS] [SEP]
  * our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: 
    * through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;
    * our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction; or
    * the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions. [CLS] [SEP]

processing errors are not:

  * delays that result from paypal applying holds, limitations or reserves. [CLS] [SEP]
  * delays based on a payment review. [CLS] [SEP]
  * delays described under how to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations. [CLS] [SEP]
  * your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending). [CLS] [SEP]

with you electronically. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that if paypal sends you an
electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email
address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider,

be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively. [CLS] [SEP]

please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from

understand that while your communications with paypal may be overheard,
monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by
paypal, and paypal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular
telephone calls will be retained or retrievable. [CLS] [SEP]

### paypal's rights

#### paypal suspension and termination rights

paypal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate
this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems
(including any networks and servers used to provide any of the paypal
services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the paypal
services for any reason and at any time upon notice to you and, upon
termination of this user agreement, the payment to you of any unrestricted
funds held in your paypal balance. [CLS] [SEP]

#### security interest

as security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement,
you grant to paypal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your paypal
balance in the possession of paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

#### amounts owed to paypal

if your paypal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative paypal
balance represents an amount that you owe to paypal. [CLS] [SEP] paypal may set off these
amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your paypal account, either
by you or from payments you receive. [CLS] [SEP] if you have more than one paypal account,
we may set off a negative paypal balance in one paypal account against a
paypal balance in your other paypal account(s). [CLS] [SEP] if you continue using your
paypal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize paypal to combine
the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when
that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or
transaction. [CLS] [SEP]

if you hold funds in a paypal account in multiple currencies, and the balance
for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, paypal may set off
the negative paypal balance by using funds you maintain in a different
currency. [CLS] [SEP] if you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period
of 21 days or longer, paypal will convert this negative balance to relevant
currency. [CLS] [SEP] in either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and
paypal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee)
will be used. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to paypal, our
affiliates, or ebay, paypal may debit your paypal account to pay any amounts
that are past due. [CLS] [SEP] this includes amounts owed by using our various products
such as xoom or braintree. [CLS] [SEP]

#### insolvency proceedings

if any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any
bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled to recover all reasonable
costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the enforcement of this user agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

#### assumption of rights

if paypal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient
(either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that paypal assumes your
rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may
pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in paypal's discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

#### no waiver

our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under
this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with
respect to subsequent or similar breaches. [CLS] [SEP]

### indemnification and limitation of liability

in this section, we use the term "paypal" to refer to paypal pte. [CLS] [SEP] ltd. [CLS] [SEP] and our
affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers. [CLS] [SEP] our affiliates
include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under
common control with. [CLS] [SEP]

#### indemnification

you must indemnify paypal for actions related to your paypal account and your
use of the paypal services. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to defend, indemnify and hold paypal
harmless from any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or
incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user
agreement, your improper use of the paypal services, your violation of any law
or the rights of a third party and/or the actions or inactions of any third
party to whom you grant permissions to use your paypal account or access our
websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to
provide any of the paypal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of
the paypal services on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP]

#### limitation of liability

 **paypal's liability is limited with respect to your paypal account and your
use of the paypal services.** in no event shall paypal be liable for lost
profits or any special, incidental or consequential damages (including without
limitation damages for loss of data or loss of business) arising out of or in
connection with our websites, software, systems (including any networks and
servers used to provide any of the paypal services) operated by us or on our
behalf, any of the paypal services, or this user agreement (however arising,
including negligence), unless and to the extent prohibited by law. [CLS] [SEP]

our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to
the actual amount of direct damages. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, paypal is not liable, and you agree not to hold paypal
responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of
money, goodwill, or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any
special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly
from: (1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, software,
systems operated by us or on our behalf (including any networks and servers
used to provide any of the paypal services) or any of the paypal services; (2)
delays or disruptions in our websites, software, systems operated by us or on
our behalf (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the
paypal services), and any of the paypal services; (3) viruses or other
malicious software obtained by accessing our websites, software, systems
operated by us or on our behalf (including any networks and servers used to
provide any of the paypal services), any of the paypal services, or any
website or service linked to our websites; (4) glitches, bugs, errors, or
inaccuracies of any kind in our websites, software, systems operated by us or
on our behalf (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the

### disclaimer of warranty and release

#### no warranty

**the paypal services are provided "as-is" and without any representation or
warranty, whether express, implied or statutory. [CLS] [SEP] paypal specifically disclaims
any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose and non-infringement.**

paypal does not have any control over the products or services provided by
sellers who accept paypal as a payment method, and paypal cannot ensure that a
buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction
or is authorized to do so. [CLS] [SEP] paypal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted
or secure access to any part of the paypal services, and operation of our
websites, software, or systems operated by us or on our behalf (including any
networks and servers used to provide any of the paypal services) may be
interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. [CLS] [SEP] paypal will make
reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits
involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and cheque issuances are
processed in a timely manner but paypal makes no representations or warranties
regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the paypal
services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as
delays in the banking system or mail service. [CLS] [SEP] this paragraph gives you
specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from
country/region to country/region. [CLS] [SEP]

#### release of paypal

if you have a dispute with any other paypal account holder, you release paypal
from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of
every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way
connected with such disputes. [CLS] [SEP] in entering into this release you expressly
waive any protections that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release
to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your
favour at the time of agreeing to this release. [CLS] [SEP]

### disputes with paypal

#### contact paypal first

if a dispute arises between you and paypal, acting as either a buyer or a
seller, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns. [CLS] [SEP] if we are unable
to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost
effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. [CLS] [SEP] disputes between you and
paypal regarding the services may be reported to [paypal customer
service](https://www.paypal.com/sg/smarthelp/contact-us). [CLS] [SEP]

#### arbitration

for any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief)
where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 usd (or other
currency equivalents), you may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost
effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] if you
elect arbitration, you will initiate such arbitration through an established
alternative dispute resolution ("adr") provider mutually agreed upon by you
and us. [CLS] [SEP] the adr provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
(a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely
based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by you; (b)
the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

"paypal.com,", "paypal," and all logos related to the paypal services are
either trademarks or registered trademarks of paypal or paypal's licensors. [CLS] [SEP]
you may not copy, imitate, modify or use them without paypal's prior written
