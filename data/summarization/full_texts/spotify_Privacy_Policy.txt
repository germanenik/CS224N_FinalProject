## 3\. [CLS] [SEP] your rights and your preferences: giving you choice and control

the general data protection regulation or "gdpr" gives certain rights to
individuals in relation to their personal data. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, we are happy to
offer transparency and access controls to help users take advantage of those
rights. [CLS] [SEP] as available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights

  * right to erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
  * right to restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
  * right to object -
  *     * the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
    * the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
  * right to data portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party's service; and
  * right not to be subject to automated decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] clicking on the link in an email will opt you out of further messages of that category (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] artist updates).

purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to

maintaining the performance of the spotify service, making data-driven
business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal
obligations, and resolving disputes. [CLS] [SEP] we keep some of your personal data for as
long as you are a user of the spotify service. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we keep your

spotify shares your personal data globally with spotify group companies in
order to carry out the activities specified in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] spotify may also
subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties

may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country. [CLS] [SEP]

personal data collected within the european union and switzerland may, for
example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country
outside of the european union and switzerland. [CLS] [SEP] in such instances spotify shall
ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance
with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual,
technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the standard
contractual clauses approved by the eu commission. [CLS] [SEP]

for further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal

## 9\. [CLS] [SEP] links

we may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links
to third-party websites. [CLS] [SEP] we cannot control or be held responsible for third
parties' privacy practices and content. [CLS] [SEP] if you click on a third-party
advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the spotify
service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this policy. [CLS] [SEP]
please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process
your personal data. [CLS] [SEP]

## 10\. [CLS] [SEP] keeping your personal data safe

we are committed to protecting our users' personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security
of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely
secure. [CLS] [SEP] we have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation,
encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised
access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. [CLS] [SEP]

your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong
password that is unique to your spotify account, never share your password
with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after
having used the spotify service. [CLS] [SEP]

## 11\. [CLS] [SEP] children

with the exception of spotify kids, a separate spotify application available
in certain markets, the spotify service is not directed to children under the
age of 13 years. [CLS] [SEP] the spotify service is also not offered to children whose age
makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent
for the processing of their personal data under the gdpr or other local law. [CLS] [SEP]

we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or
under the applicable age limit (the "age limit"). [CLS] [SEP] if you are under the age
limit, please do not use the spotify service, and do not provide any personal
data to us. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a parent of a child under the age limit and become aware that your
child has provided personal data to spotify, please contact us using the
'contact us' form on the [privacy center](https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy),
and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in section 3
'your rights and your preferences: giving you choice and control' of this
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age
of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. [CLS] [SEP] this
may require us to delete the spotify account for that child. [CLS] [SEP]

## 12\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to this policy

we may occasionally make changes to this policy. [CLS] [SEP]

when we make material changes to this policy, we'll provide you with prominent
notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent
notice within the spotify service or by sending you an email and/or a device
notification. [CLS] [SEP] we may notify you in advance. [CLS] [SEP]

please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully. [CLS] [SEP]
