# terms of use

**brilliant.org website terms of use  
and copyright notice **

the following terms and conditions (the "agreement") govern all use of the
www.brilliant.org website (the "site") and the products and services available
on or at the site (taken together with the site, the "service"). [CLS] [SEP] the service
is owned and operated by brilliant worldwide, inc. [CLS] [SEP] ("brilliant"). [CLS] [SEP] the service
is offered subject to your (the "user's") acceptance without modification of
all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating
rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the
site by brilliant. [CLS] [SEP] by using or accessing any part of the service, you (the
"user") agree to all of the terms and conditions contained herein; if you not
agree, do not use or access the service. [CLS] [SEP]

brilliant reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any
of the terms or conditions of this agreement at any time. [CLS] [SEP] it is user's
responsibility to check this agreement periodically for changes. [CLS] [SEP] user's
continued use of the service following the posting of any changes to this
agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. [CLS] [SEP]

### access. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the software and
services provided in connection with the service are solely for user's own
personal use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant may
change, suspend or discontinue the services, including the availability of any
feature, database or content, at any time. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant may also impose limits on
certain features and services or restrict user's access to parts or all of the
services without notice or liability. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant reserves the right, at its
discretion, to modify this agreement at any time by posting a notice on the
site or by sending user a notice via email or postal mail. [CLS] [SEP] user shall be
responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. [CLS] [SEP]
use of the service by user following such notification constitutes user's
acceptance of the terms and conditions of this agreement as modified. [CLS] [SEP]

user certifies to brilliant that if user is an individual (i.e., not a
corporation) user is at least 13 years of age (provided that, if user is
located in a state in which 13 is under the age of majority, then user
represents he/she has the legal consent of a legal guardian to enter this
agreement). [CLS] [SEP] user also certifies that user is legally permitted to use the
service and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the
service. [CLS] [SEP] this agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to
access the service is revoked in such jurisdictions. [CLS] [SEP]

### fees and payment. [CLS] [SEP]

the basic service is free to users, but if user elects to upgrade to a
subscription membership or any of our other paid features, the following terms
below shall apply. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant reserves the right to change its prices at any
time. [CLS] [SEP]

#### a. [CLS] [SEP] billing and payment. [CLS] [SEP]

brilliant bills users through an online account for use of the service. [CLS] [SEP] user
agrees to pay brilliant all applicable service fees using this online account. [CLS] [SEP]
all fees are exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g. [CLS] [SEP] sales, use, or value-added
tax), unless otherwise stated, and user is solely responsible for the payment
of any such taxes that may be imposed on your use of the service. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant
may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has
already requested or received payment. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant reserves the right to change
its prices for certain service features - and to institute new charges at any
time - upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the site. [CLS] [SEP]
user agrees to maintain current, complete and accurate information for user's
billing account. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, user authorizes brilliant to obtain updated or
replacement expiration dates and card numbers for user's credit or debit card
as provided by user's credit or debit card issuer. [CLS] [SEP] all fees are final and
nonrefundable (including in the event any features or functions of any service
that user has subscribed to are changed, modified, diminished or removed). [CLS] [SEP]
user shall be responsible for any applicable foreign transaction fees charged
by user's bank. [CLS] [SEP]

#### b. [CLS] [SEP] automatic renewal

user's subscription to the service will continue indefinitely until cancelled
by user (via the cancellation mechanisms provided on the site). [CLS] [SEP] after user's
initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription
period, user's subscription will automatically continue for an additional
equivalent period, at the price user agreed to when subscribing. [CLS] [SEP] user agrees
that user's account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature. [CLS] [SEP] if user
does not wish user's account to renew automatically, or if user wants to
change or terminate user's subscription, please log in and go to the change /
cancel membership page. [CLS] [SEP] if user cancels a subscription, user may use such
subscription until the end of then-current subscription term and the
subscription will not be renewed thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] however, user will not be
eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for
the then-current subscription period. [CLS] [SEP]

by subscribing, user authorizes brilliant to charge user's credit card, debit
card or other payment method at such time and again at the beginning of any
subsequent subscription period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed
on user's subscription payments. [CLS] [SEP] upon the renewal of your subscription, if
brilliant does not receive payment, user agrees that brilliant may either
terminate or suspend user's subscription and continue to attempt to charge
user's payment method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of
payment, user's account will be activated and for purposes of automatic
renewal, user's new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day
payment was received). [CLS] [SEP] if user does not terminate user's subscription and/or
if user continues to use the service, user agrees that brilliant is authorized
to charge the payment method in user's service account. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant may also
seek payment directly from user. [CLS] [SEP] charges may be payable in advance, in
arrears, per usage, or as otherwise specified when user initially subscribes
to the service. [CLS] [SEP]

#### c. [CLS] [SEP] promotions

any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level access to the
service must be used within the specified time of the trial. [CLS] [SEP] user must cancel
user's subscription before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being
charged a subscription fee. [CLS] [SEP]

### site content. [CLS] [SEP]

user agrees that all content and materials (collectively, "content") delivered
via the service or otherwise made available by brilliant at the site are
protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets or
other proprietary rights and laws. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly authorized by brilliant
in writing, user agrees not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy,
reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit
or create derivative works from such materials or content. [CLS] [SEP] however, user may
print or download a reasonable number of copies of the materials or content at

consequences of posting or publishing them. [CLS] [SEP] user agrees that brilliant has no

and affiliates, from any and all liability arising out of or relating to user
submission(s) or any part thereof. [CLS] [SEP]

by submitting the user submission(s) to brilliant, or displaying, publishing,
or otherwise posting any content on or through the sites or the service, user
hereby does and shall grant brilliant a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual,
royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to reproduce,
distribute, modify (such as by editing or otherwise creating derivatives),
display, and perform the user submission(s) in accordance with brilliant's
user submission policies and user's site settings. [CLS] [SEP] user agrees not to contest
any modifications made by brilliant and hereby waives any claims with respect
thereto. [CLS] [SEP] for clarity, the foregoing license grant to brilliant does not affect
user's other ownership or license rights in your user submission(s), including
the right to grant additional licenses to the material in user's user
submission(s). [CLS] [SEP] user submission(s) may be withdrawn by written request to
support@brilliant.org to delete content. [CLS] [SEP]

warrants that: (i) user owns or has the necessary licenses, rights, consents,

the posting of your user submission on or through the sites or the service or
otherwise does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual
property rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP]
user agrees to pay all royalties, fees, and other monies owing any person or
entity by reason of any content posted by user to or through the sites or the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

user further agrees that user will not: (i) publish falsehoods or
misrepresentations that could damage brilliant or any third party; (ii) submit
material that is unlawful, obscene, lewd, defamatory, libelous, threatening,
pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive,
excessively violent, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal
offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise
inappropriate or objectionable; (iii) post advertisements or solicitations of
business; (iv) impersonate another person; (v) submit material that is
copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party
intellectual property or proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity
right, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their
rightful owner to post the material and to grant brilliant all of the license
rights granted herein; or (vi) submit material that is unsuitable for minors
in any country. [CLS] [SEP]

brilliant does not endorse any user submission or any opinion, recommendation,
or advice expressed therein, and brilliant expressly disclaims any and all
responsibility or liability in connection with user submission(s). [CLS] [SEP] brilliant
reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, remove any user submission(s)
at any time (with or without notice). [CLS] [SEP]

permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (i) copy, modify, or distribute
the software; (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise
attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of
all or any part of the software (except that this restriction shall not apply

timesharing or service bureau purposes, or otherwise use the software for any
commercial purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

### restrictions. [CLS] [SEP]

equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of
the service or any content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the

§1542, which states: "a general release does not extend to claims which the
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor."

or by posting notices on the site. [CLS] [SEP] user agrees that all agreements, notices,
disclosures and other communications that brilliant provides to user
electronically satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in
writing. [CLS] [SEP]

### miscellaneous. [CLS] [SEP]

the failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant
shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where
such failure results from any cause beyond brilliant' reasonable control,
including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications
failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). [CLS] [SEP] if any provision
of this agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by user except
with brilliant' prior written consent. [CLS] [SEP] brilliant may transfer, assign or
delegate this agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. [CLS] [SEP] this
agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the state of pennsylvania, as if made within pennsylvania between two
residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the state and federal courts located in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP]
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without limiting either party's
right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief immediately, at any time,
in any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising with respect to
this agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules
and procedures of the judicial arbitration and mediation service, inc. [CLS] [SEP]
("jams"). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. [CLS] [SEP]
in the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days
of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it
plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator
affiliated with jams, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such
arbitrator to resolve the dispute. [CLS] [SEP] the written decision of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court. [CLS] [SEP] the
arbitration proceeding shall take place in san francisco, california, using
the english language. [CLS] [SEP] both parties agree that this agreement is the complete
and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and
supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements,
communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this
agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both
parties, except as otherwise provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] no agency, partnership, joint
venture, or employment is created as a result of this agreement and user does
not have any authority of any kind to bind brilliant in any respect
whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]
