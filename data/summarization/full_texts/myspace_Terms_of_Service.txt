  9. [CLS] [SEP] profiles and profile settings

myspace may allow you to create multiple profiles associated with your account
on certain aspects of, or all of the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] examples of such
profiles are “real name profiles”, “alias profiles”, “parody profiles”, “role
playing profiles”, “fan profiles”, “artist profiles”, or other profiles that
myspace may authorize from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] we may offer you, from time to time,
the ability to choose how you share or make your profile, or aspects of it,
available to others by means of “ **profile settings** ”, which functionality
may change as the myspace services evolve. [CLS] [SEP] myspace currently makes all
profiles of members aged 18 and older public by default. [CLS] [SEP] profiles of members
whose ages are 13 to 17 are currently “restricted” by default, as further
detailed in the [privacy policy](/pages/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] you may adjust the public or
restricted status of your profile in your profile settings. [CLS] [SEP] we will make good
faith efforts to honor profile settings, but are not responsible for errors
and reserve the right to change the way settings and preferences work from
time to time, so visit your profile settings regularly to ensure that the
reflect your preferences and to see how we may have added or changed how you
can exercise choice. [CLS] [SEP] for more information on how to use profile settings, and
how they are intended to work, click [here](/settings/profile). [CLS] [SEP] you may not
use any profile for purpose of impersonation, deception or confusion. [CLS] [SEP]

    1. [CLS] [SEP] **real name profiles**. [CLS] [SEP] you may create a profile in which your activities on the myspace services are associated with your real name (each, a “ **real name profile** ”), and you agree and acknowledge that any risk associated with such real name profiles are borne solely by you. [CLS] [SEP] 
    2. [CLS] [SEP] **alias profiles**. [CLS] [SEP] an alias profile allows you to create an alternate public-facing profile as an alternative to a real name profile, which publicly displays your real name in association with your profile and activities on the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, you might decide that in an alias profile, your username or full name for that profile is a nickname or other made up name. [CLS] [SEP] 
    3. [CLS] [SEP] **parody, role playing and fan profiles**. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may allow you to create profiles for the purpose of parody, role playing, or being a fan (collectively, parody, role playing and fan profiles are known as “ **non-standard profiles** ”). [CLS] [SEP] you are allowed to create non-standard profiles, but you must indicate in the non-standard profile that non-standard profile will be used for the non-standard profile purposes, by including a statement of this fact in the about section of your profile (e.g., “this is a parody profile.”, or similar language). [CLS] [SEP] you must also ensure that the full name that you choose for the non-standard profile includes some indication that the non-standard profile is being used in a parody, role-playing, fan or other manner than as a true and veritable account of an actual living person. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you want to create a non-standard profile for the purpose of (i) role playing, you should add “-roleplay” to the end of the desired full name; (ii) fanning, you should add “-fan” to the end of the desired full name; (iii) parody or farce, you should add “-fake”, “-parody”, or “-joke” to the end of the desired full name. [CLS] [SEP] you must not use a non-standard profile for purposes of impersonation, deception or confusion. [CLS] [SEP] 
    4. [CLS] [SEP] **artist profiles**. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may allow you to create a profile specifically designed for artists (each an “ **artist profile** ”), for example, musicians, comedians, or other artists. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may provide artist profiles with features and functionality not available to other profile types, and you must not use an artist profile if you are not legitimately an artist. [CLS] [SEP] 
    5. [CLS] [SEP] **suspension or termination**. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may suspend or terminate profiles, and/or the membership of accounts associated with them, in the event they do not comply with this agreement, or for any other or no reason. [CLS] [SEP] individuals and artists that are members may set up profiles, subject to certain rules. [CLS] [SEP] from time to time we may offer certain functionality to allow you to express privacy, communication and other preferences, which we will make a good faith effort to honor. [CLS] [SEP] 

  10. [CLS] [SEP] protecting copyrights and other intellectual property

myspace respects the intellectual property of others, and requires that our
users and members do the same. [CLS] [SEP] you may not upload, embed, post, email,
transmit or otherwise make available any content that infringes any copyright,
patent, trademark, trade secret, privacy, publicity or other proprietary
rights of any person or entity. [CLS] [SEP] it is myspace’s policy to terminate, in
appropriate circumstances, the membership of repeat or substantial infringers. [CLS] [SEP]

your complaint. [CLS] [SEP] more information about copyright and trademark can be found

[CLS] [SEP] linked services may use your profile information, friends and/or other profile content on the linked service and share activity events between myspace and the linked service (depending on the features the linked service chooses to make available). [CLS] [SEP] we may offer you certain ability to control what is initially shared with linked services through your profile settings, or permission options otherwise made available to you (e.g., when downloading, accessing or activating linked services), and we will use good faith efforts to honor those choices. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] if you choose to use a linked service, the linked service may collect, store, use and share your data in accordance with the terms of service and privacy policy of and your privacy settings (if any) on such linked service (not myspace’s privacy settings or privacy policy). [CLS] [SEP] in addition, the third party providing the linked service may use other parties to provide portions of the application or service to you, such as technology, development or payment services. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may have limited control or no control at all over the content, operations, policies, terms, or other elements of linked service, and myspace does not assume any obligation to review any linked service. [CLS] [SEP] myspace does not endorse, approve, or sponsor any linked service, or any third-party content, advertising, information, materials, products, services, or other items.

[CLS] [SEP] myspace encourages you not to provide any personally identifiable information to any linked service unless you know and are comfortable with the third party with whom you are interacting. [CLS] [SEP] finally, myspace will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damages, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within linked services. [CLS] [SEP] any activities you engage in with any of the same, including but not limited to the provision of content or data to them, are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use, and rules issued by the operator of the linked service so we encourage you to review them carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

    2. [CLS] [SEP] hyperlinks to myspace. [CLS] [SEP] we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to create hyperlinks to the myspace services, so long as: (a) the links only incorporate text, and do not use any trademarked logos or graphics that are owned by or licensed to myspace, without myspace’s prior authorization, (b) the links and the content on your website do not suggest any affiliation with myspace or cause any other confusion, and (c) the links and the content on your website do not portray myspace or its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter, and do not contain content that is unlawful, offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, threatening, harassing, or abusive, or that violate any right of any third party or are otherwise objectionable to myspace.

[CLS] [SEP]

    3. [CLS] [SEP] ads, affiliate programs, and links. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may participate in various advertising and/or affiliate marketing programs. [CLS] [SEP] these programs are designed to provide a means for companies like myspace to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to other websites that sell products or services. [CLS] [SEP] myspace may generate revenue from these other websites when you either click these links or purchase products and/or services from these links on those other websites. [CLS] [SEP]

  12. [CLS] [SEP] member disputes

you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users, third party
developers and any other parties with whom you interact through the myspace
services and/or linked services so use caution when dealing with others. [CLS] [SEP]
myspace reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any
way with these disputes. [CLS] [SEP]
