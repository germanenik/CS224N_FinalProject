## summary of changes to myspace privacy policy

we have revised our privacy policy as of august 5, 2016. [CLS] [SEP] please note that this
summary is provided to help your review of changes to the policy. [CLS] [SEP] please
carefully review the entire policy prior to agreeing to be bound by it. [CLS] [SEP] we use
certain capitalized terms in this summary. [CLS] [SEP] the definitions of these
capitalized terms can be found in the policy. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **april 27, 2017**

we revised information about the corporate ownership of myspace. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **august 5, 2016**
    * new [privacy notice](/pages/eeaprivacy) for residents of the european economic area. [CLS] [SEP] our eea privacy notice provides further information about rights that are specific to the eea and makes it easier for eea residents to locate the additional privacy terms that apply to them. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * due to changes in the corporate structure of myspace and its affiliates, we have provided new information about which companies hold and have access to your personal information. [CLS] [SEP] we have also clarified that, while our affiliates have their own privacy policies for information that they collect independently, they will treat your myspace information in accordance with myspace’s privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * we have clarified that when we transfer your myspace information to a third party, we require them to treat your information in accordance with the myspace privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] however, it continues to be the case that any information that you give directly to a third party (or that a third party website gathers from you in any way when you visit that website) is governed by the third party’s privacy policy. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * we have clarified that we may store information from inactive accounts (which are accounts not used for two years or more) in case you want to reactivate your account, but we are not obliged to do that. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * we have deleted references to separate privacy policies for our "classic" services because those versions of our services are no longer available. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * in line with evolving global privacy terminology, instead of distinguishing between "personal" and "demographic" information, we have revised our explanation of what aggregated data is and how we treat it, as compared to personal information. [CLS] [SEP] 
    * we have clarified what items of personal information cannot be hidden from public view when you use our services. [CLS] [SEP] we have provided additional information about how your privacy is protected when we (or our affiliates) use your personal information for interest-based web advertising. [CLS] [SEP] 

  * **october 14, 2015**

we changed the reference to imh-affiliated companies to viant technology, inc. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **june 24, 2014**

we clarified that when you authorize us to share your information with third
parties, those third parties may add information from other sources to that
information, and they, in turn, may share your information with other third
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **may 19, 2014**
    * we added references to the privacy setting associated with personalized advertising. [CLS] [SEP]
    * we moved the third party opt-out information table to a separate page for easier updating. [CLS] [SEP]

  * **june 10, 2013 summary of changes to myspace privacy policy**

the goal of this revision is to make the policy more user-friendly. [CLS] [SEP] we revised
the policy to make it less legalistic, more easily readable, and we reduced
redundant disclosures. [CLS] [SEP] please note that some of the section numbers have
changed as a result of consolidation and simplification of disclosure. [CLS] [SEP] we
removed references to the classic myspace since we are rolling out the new
myspace platform in its place. [CLS] [SEP] references in the policy to our sister company,
specific media, have been expanded to include other imh affiliates, including
specific media, vindico and site meter. [CLS] [SEP] we added certain disclosures related
to recent legal developments. [CLS] [SEP] we reduced the use of defined terms and moved
others to a “key terms” page in order to simplify the policy and make the
definitions of common terms easier to find. [CLS] [SEP] we revised certain disclosure
about general and product specific privacy settings to reflect product
updates. [CLS] [SEP] we clarified that we may share certain of your information with our
service providers. [CLS] [SEP] we clarified that you may be served with advertising on the
myspace services and on third party websites and platforms based on
information about we collect or receive about you both on and off the myspace
services. [CLS] [SEP] we also clarified that content recommendations may be based on
information we collect or receive both on and off of the myspace services. [CLS] [SEP]

again, this is only a summary and is not a complete description of all
changes. [CLS] [SEP] please carefully review the entire policy in order to more fully
understand our practices. [CLS] [SEP]
