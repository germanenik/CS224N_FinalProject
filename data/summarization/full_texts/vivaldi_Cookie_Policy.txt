# cookie policy

a cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by
a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember
information about you, such as your language preference or login information. [CLS] [SEP]
these cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

we use cookies for the following purposes:

  * assisting you in navigating websites smoothly;
  * assisting in registration and login in vivaldi services. [CLS] [SEP]

below is a detailed list of the cookies we use on our website. [CLS] [SEP] our website is
scanned with our cookie scanning tool regularly to maintain a list as accurate
as possible. [CLS] [SEP] we classify cookies in the following categories:

  * strictly necessary cookies;
  * security cookies;
  * anonymous performance cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

### strictly necessary cookies

these cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched
off in our systems. [CLS] [SEP] they are usually only set in response to actions made by
you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy
preferences, logging in or filling in forms. [CLS] [SEP] you can set your browser to block
or alert you about these cookies, but in this case some parts of the site may
not work. [CLS] [SEP]

wpml_browser_redirect_test and _icl_visitor_lang_js | these are used by our
locally installed wpml plugin to identify the preferred user language as our
site is multilingual. [CLS] [SEP] [read
more](https://wpml.org/documentation/support/browser-cookies-stored-wpml/). [CLS] [SEP]  
---|---  
io  
express.sid | nodebb session cookies allow you to comment on our blog articles
while being logged in vivaldi forum. [CLS] [SEP]  
openid-connect-generic-redirect | cookie that allows you to recognize if you
have an open session with our services (blogs, forum, mail, sync) and keep you
connected to it. [CLS] [SEP]  
commonauthid | it is set to the user’s browser with the hostname of wso2
identity server instance and the value of the commonauthid cookie is the sso
session identifier. [CLS] [SEP] when sso session is created in the wso2 identity server,
the session is put into the session cache and persisted to the database. [CLS] [SEP] [read
more](https://docs.wso2.com/display/is520/enabling+authentication+session+persistence). [CLS] [SEP]  
opbs | the op browser state is typically going to be stored in a cookie or
html5 local storage. [CLS] [SEP] it is origin bound to the authorization server. [CLS] [SEP] it
captures meaningful events such as logins, logouts, change of user, change of
authentication status for clients being used by the end-user, etc. [CLS] [SEP] [read
more](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html). [CLS] [SEP]  
jsessionid | it is set by login.vivaldi.net to track the session. [CLS] [SEP]  
phpsessid  
attribution_user_id  
device_view | cookies necessary for the function of embedded forms created
using [typeform](https://www.typeform.com/help/what-happens-to-my-data/), for
example to detect language preference and set visual design elements of the
forms. [CLS] [SEP] these can be blocked by enabling “block third party cookies” in your
browser’s privacy settings. [CLS] [SEP]
