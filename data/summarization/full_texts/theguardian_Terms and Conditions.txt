 **15\. [CLS] [SEP] governing law & jurisdiction (for us users)**

if you have accessed the guardian site from the us, these terms and conditions
are governed by the laws of the united states of america and the laws of the
state of new york. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or
dispute with guardian or relating in any way to your use of the guardian site
resides in the courts of the county of new york, state of new york, and you
further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction
in the courts of the county of new york, state of new york, in connection with
any such dispute and including any claim involving guardian news & media llc
or its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, officers, directors,
telecommunication providers and content providers. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any cause of
action or claim that you may have with respect to your use of the guardian
site must be commenced within one year after the act or omission giving rise
to the claim or cause of action arose. [CLS] [SEP]

 **16\. [CLS] [SEP] additional disclaimers**

visitors to the guardian site agree that their use of the guardian site is at
their own sole risk. [CLS] [SEP] the guardian site is provided “as is” and “as available,”
without warranty of any kind, either express or implied including but not
limited to: (i) any warranties concerning the availability, accuracy,
appropriateness, reliability, timeliness, or usefulness of the content of the
guardian site; and (ii) any warranties of title, warranty of non-infringement,
or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. [CLS] [SEP] guardian
also makes no representations and warranties as to any linked sites and
guardian has no liability or responsibility with respect to your use of such
sites. [CLS] [SEP] in some instances, content made available on the guardian site may
represent the opinions and judgments of providers or users, such as user
content. [CLS] [SEP] guardian and its affiliates do not endorse nor shall they be
responsible or liable for the accuracy or reliability of any statement made on
the guardian site by anyone other than authorised guardian employees acting in
such capacity. [CLS] [SEP]  
this disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injuries caused by the
guardian site, including, without limitation, those damages or injuries
occurring as a result of: (i) any error, omission, deletion, or defect in the
content available on the guardian site; or (ii) any failure of performance,
error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or
transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction
of records, information or data, unauthorised access to, alteration of, or use
of records, information or data, whether for breach of contract, tort,
negligence, defamation, or any other cause of action. [CLS] [SEP] guardian does not
warrant or guarantee that access to the guardian site will be uninterrupted or
error-free. [CLS] [SEP]  
applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above
exclusion may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

 **17\. [CLS] [SEP] limitation of liability**

you acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence) or otherwise, in no event will guardian or its affiliates,
including, without limitation, their respective officers, directors,
employees, successors and assigns, be liable to you or any other party for any
direct or indirect loss, damage, cost, expense or liability of any kind
(“loss”) arising in any way out of or in connection with the availability,
use, reliance on, or inability to use the guardian site, including (without
limitation): (i) damages for business interruption, loss of business and other
profits, loss of programs, cost of replacing equipment or software or loss of
records, information or data, loss of use of data, loss of revenue, loss of
goodwill, loss of customers, loss of or damage to reputation, loss of capital,
downtime costs, loss under or in relation to any other contract, or loss of
anticipated savings or benefits; (ii) any indirect, special, exemplary,
punitive, incidental or consequential loss; or (iii) any loss attributable to
errors, omissions, or other inaccuracies in the guardian site. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusion
of liability in this section 17 applies even if guardian shall have been
advised of the possibility of such loss. [CLS] [SEP]

because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
of liability for particular kinds of loss, in such states or jurisdictions,
guardian’s liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law (thereby
minimizing guardian’s liability to you to the lowest amount that applicable
law permits). [CLS] [SEP]

 **18\. [CLS] [SEP] exclusion of warranties (for australian users)**

the australian consumer law may confer certain rights and remedies on you in
relation to the provision by guardian of goods and services under these terms
and conditions. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the disclaimers and limitations of liability
in sections 4, 16 and 17 above, these terms and conditions do not exclude,
restrict or modify the application of any condition, warranty, guarantee,
right or remedy conferred by or implied under any provision of the australian
consumer law or any other statute where to do so would: (i) contravene the
relevant statute; or (ii) cause any part of these terms and conditions to be
void and/or unenforceable (“non-excludable obligation”). [CLS] [SEP]

except in relation to non-excludable obligations, all conditions, warranties
and other provisions implied or conferred by statute, custom, or the general
law that impose any liability or obligation on guardian are expressly excluded
under these terms and conditions. [CLS] [SEP]

 **19\. [CLS] [SEP] non-excludable obligations (for australian users)**

in relation to non-excludable obligations (other than a guarantee as to title,
encumbrances or quiet possession conferred by the australian consumer law),
except for goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or household use or consumption (in respect of which our liability is
not so limited under these terms and conditions), guardian’s liability to you
for a failure to comply with any non-excludable obligation is limited to: (i)
in the case of services, the lowest of the cost of supplying the services
again and payment of the cost of having the services supplied again; and (ii)
in the case of goods, the lowest of the cost of replacing the goods, supplying
equivalent goods or having the goods repaired, or payment of the cost of
replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods or having the goods repaired. [CLS] [SEP]
