# how microsoft categorizes data for online services

## data used to deliver online and professional services

![person using a pen with a tablet
device.](//www.microsoft.com/onerfstatics/marketingsites-wcus-
prod/_h/9be151e5/coreui.statics/images/1x1clear.gif)

### customer data

customer data is all data, including text, sound, video or image files, and
software that you provide to microsoft or that’s provided on your behalf
through your use of microsoft enterprise online services, excluding microsoft
professional services. [CLS] [SEP] it includes customer content, which is the data you
upload for storage or processing and apps you upload for distribution through
a microsoft enterprise cloud service. [CLS] [SEP]



for example, customer content includes exchange online email and attachments,
power bi reports, sharepoint online site content, or instant messaging
conversations. [CLS] [SEP]

![person sitting at a desk looking at a laptop
screen.](//www.microsoft.com/onerfstatics/marketingsites-wcus-
prod/_h/9be151e5/coreui.statics/images/1x1clear.gif)

### diagnostic data

diagnostic data includes all data “collected” or “obtained” from software that
you locally install for use in connection with the microsoft enterprise online
service. [CLS] [SEP] it is used to help microsoft ensure the client software is secure and
performing properly. [CLS] [SEP]



for example, microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch
an app, whether an add-in has crashed, and how many times a sign-in has been
attempted. [CLS] [SEP] diagnostic data can also be referred to as telemetry data. [CLS] [SEP] it does
not include names, email addresses, or file content. [CLS] [SEP]

![person working with multiple
laptops.](//www.microsoft.com/onerfstatics/marketingsites-wcus-
prod/_h/9be151e5/coreui.statics/images/1x1clear.gif)

### service-generated data

service-generated data includes all data “generated” or “derived” by microsoft
through the operation of an online service. [CLS] [SEP] microsoft aggregates this data
from our online services and uses it to make sure performance, security,
scaling, and other services that impact the customer experience are operating
at the levels our customers require. [CLS] [SEP]



for example, to understand how to ramp up data center capacity as a customer's
use of microsoft teams increases, we process log data of their teams usage. [CLS] [SEP] we
then review the logs for peak times and decide which data centers to add to
meet this capacity. [CLS] [SEP]

![person wearing a headset sitting in front of large desktop monitors, smiling
and looking to one side.](//www.microsoft.com/onerfstatics/marketingsites-
wcus-prod/_h/9be151e5/coreui.statics/images/1x1clear.gif)

### professional services data

professional services data means all data, provided to microsoft, or processed
by microsoft, upon authorization and through an engagement with microsoft to
obtain professional services. [CLS] [SEP] professional services data includes support data
that is provided to microsoft during technical support for an online service. [CLS] [SEP]



for example, include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to
microsoft during troubleshooting. [CLS] [SEP]

## other microsoft data definitions

![](https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-
com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imagefiledata/re4xdnh?ver=12f8&q=90&h=40&b=%23ffffffff&aim=true)

### administrator data

administrator data is information about administrators supplied during signup,
purchase, or administration of microsoft services, such as names, phone
numbers, and email addresses. [CLS] [SEP] it also includes aggregated usage information
and data associated with your account, such as the controls you select. [CLS] [SEP] we use
administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the
account, and detect and prevent fraud. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-
com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imagefiledata/re4xqkd?ver=650f&q=90&h=40&b=%23ffffffff&aim=true)

### payment data

payment data is the information you provide when you buy something online with
microsoft. [CLS] [SEP] it may include a credit card number and security code, name,
billing address, and other financial data. [CLS] [SEP] we use payment data to complete
transactions and to detect and prevent fraud. [CLS] [SEP]

![](https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-
com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imagefiledata/re4xsxf?ver=3318&q=90&h=40&b=%23ffffffff&aim=true)

### personal data

“personal data” means any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person. [CLS] [SEP] an identifiable natural person is one who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, such as a name, an identification number,
location coordinates, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
identity of that natural person. [CLS] [SEP]



microsoft uses the same gdpr definition for personal data. [CLS] [SEP] it includes
pseudonymized data. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to being a subset of administrator data and
payment data, personal data is a subset of each of the data categories
presented above. [CLS] [SEP]
