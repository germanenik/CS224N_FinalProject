**9. [CLS] [SEP]   what are our retention practices?**

ancestry services are fundamentally premised on the notion that the personal
voyage of self-discovery is not a one-time event and continues over lengthy
periods of time--possibly lifetimes. [CLS] [SEP] additionally, and with particular regard
to our subscribers and dna customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions,
the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and dna
features provide benefits and insights to our users over time. [CLS] [SEP] as a result,
our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts
on our system until our users inform us of their desire to delete their data
or close their accounts. [CLS] [SEP]

information category | retention period  
---|---  
**account and profile** | ancestry will retain the personal information you
provide while creating your account and your profile until such time as you
ask us to delete it. [CLS] [SEP]  
**family tree** | due to the multi-generational significance of family trees,
ancestry will retain your family tree data as needed to provide you with
continuous access, updated features, and the ability to enhance your family
tree. [CLS] [SEP]  
**dna** | ancestry retains your dna data as needed to provide you with the
features and functionality you purchased (or were gifted), including
continuously updated features such as dna matches, increasingly granular
ethnicity estimates and improved regions and communities, as well as new other
features based on your dna data. [CLS] [SEP]  
**related brands** | some of our related brands (fold3®, newspapers.com™, find
a grave®, we remember® or archives®) have their own account logins and will
retain the personal information you provide while creating your account and
your profile as needed to provide you with continuous and updated services
until such time as you ask us to delete it. [CLS] [SEP] you can delete these accounts at
any time. [CLS] [SEP]  
**usage information** | we retain usage information (e.g., visits to sites) in
a depersonalized or aggregated form. [CLS] [SEP] once aggregated, this information ceases
to be personal and will not be subject to user deletion requests. [CLS] [SEP]  
  


**10. [CLS] [SEP]   how can i delete my personal information?**

information category | how to delete  
---|---  
**personal information** |

you can delete your personal information from ancestry by logging into your
[account settings](https://www.ancestry.com/secure/account). [CLS] [SEP]

if you have shared information with other users (for example, by making your
family trees public or by sharing your dna results directly with other users),
ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other users
may have retained, which can only be removed by your contacting the other user
and asking them to delete it. [CLS] [SEP]

please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records
to the responsible archival entity. [CLS] [SEP]

we will consider requests for removal of personal information from the
searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis in
accordance with law. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**genetic** | **please note** : if you request that ancestry delete your dna
data, we will delete _all_ genetic information, including any derivative
genetic information (ethnicity estimates, genetic relative matches, etc.) from
our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days. [CLS] [SEP]

to request the destruction of your biological samples, you must contact
[member services](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport). [CLS] [SEP] please note
that if you have agreed to our [informed consent to
research](https://www.ancestry.com/dna/legal/informedconsent/latest), we will
not be able to remove your genetic information from active or completed
research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
**general** | please note that there may be some latency in deleting your
personal information from our backup systems after it has been deleted from
our production, development, analytics, and research systems. [CLS] [SEP] also, our
laboratory partners may retain information they receive from us in order to
comply with laws or regulations that may require them to do so, such as the
clinical laboratory improvements amendments regulations administered by the
u.s. [CLS] [SEP] food and drug administration. [CLS] [SEP] ancestry may also retain certain
information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations
(including law enforcement requests), resolve disputes, maintain security,
prevent fraud and abuse, as well as to comply with tax, payment industry,
securities, and clinical regulatory compliance requirements. [CLS] [SEP]  
**related brands** | to delete information from our related brands (fold3®,
newspapers.com™, find a grave®, we remember® or archives®), you can always
contact us at the related brand and request that your personal information be
deleted from that service. [CLS] [SEP] some services may also have an online request form
accessible from that service's account settings menu and viewable

**11. [CLS] [SEP]   security**

ancestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to
protect our customers' personal information using administrative, physical,
and technical safeguards. [CLS] [SEP]

the specific security measures used are based on the sensitivity of the
personal information collected. [CLS] [SEP] we have measures in place to protect against
inappropriate access, loss, misuse, or alteration of personal information

the ancestry security team regularly reviews our security and privacy
practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our

we use secure server software to encrypt personal information (including
genetic information), and we only partner with security companies that meet
and commit to our security standards. [CLS] [SEP] while we cannot guarantee that loss,
misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use reasonable efforts to
prevent this. [CLS] [SEP]

it is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your
personal information by maintaining strong passwords and protecting against
the unauthorized use of your own computer or device. [CLS] [SEP]



**12. [CLS] [SEP]   data transfer and privacy shield notice**

any transfer of your personal and genetic information between ancestry's
ireland-based company and ancestry's u.s.-based companies for processing in
the united states is conducted pursuant to established transfer mechanisms
such as standard contractual clauses or privacy shield. [CLS] [SEP]

**please note** : although the european court of justice declared privacy
shield invalid as a mechanism for eu-us transfers of personal information
between eu countries and the united states, ancestry and its subsidiaries, as
part of our commitment to privacy, continue to commit to the privacy shield
principles. [CLS] [SEP]

you can request a copy of any standard contractual clauses relating to your
personal information that we may have executed by contacting us using the
details below. [CLS] [SEP]

ancestry and its subsidiaries (namely ancestry.com operations inc,
ancestry.com dna llc, ancestry international dna llc and findagrave inc.)
listed in its certification on the privacy shield website comply with the
eu-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework and swiss-u.s. [CLS] [SEP] privacy shield framework as

ancestry will comply with the privacy shield principles of notice, choice,
accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose
limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability in respect of such
personal data. [CLS] [SEP] ancestry's accountability for personal data that it receives
under the privacy shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is
described in the privacy shield principles. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, ancestry remains
responsible and liable under the privacy shield principles if third-party
agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf (1) do so in
a manner inconsistent with the principles and (2) ancestry is responsible for
the event giving rise to the damage. [CLS] [SEP]

we encourage you to contact us as detailed below should you have a privacy
shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint. [CLS] [SEP] if you are a resident

**17.5.2   right to delete. [CLS] [SEP] **the ccpa gives california consumers the right to
request that we delete your personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are submitting a request to delete on your own behalf, there are two
ways to make your request: online or by email. [CLS] [SEP] note that to delete your
personal information, you must delete your account and that once an account
deletion request is completed, this process is irreversible. [CLS] [SEP] your information
(including, but not limited to, family trees, records, photos, dna data and
ancestryhealth® results) will be permanently deleted. [CLS] [SEP]

to submit your request for deletion online:

  1. [CLS] [SEP] log into your ancestry account. [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] go to your [account settings](https://www.ancestry.com/secure/account). [CLS] [SEP]

to email your request to delete, email us at
[ccpasupport@ancestry.com](mailto:ccpasupport@ancestry.com). [CLS] [SEP] we are required
to verify your identity before we delete your data. [CLS] [SEP] we will require you to
provide proof of identity and california address (e.g., you may be required to
provide a copy of your government id, which will be used solely to verify your
identity and address). [CLS] [SEP]

if you are an "authorized agent" pursuant to the ccpa and are submitting a

"authorized agents" to make requests to know and requests for deletion. [CLS] [SEP] to use
an authorized agent, email us at
