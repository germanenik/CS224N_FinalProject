in its sole discretion, to edit, move, delete, or refuse to post any material,

objectionable or stale. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding this right of ours, users shall remain
solely responsible for the content of their messages and video submissions. [CLS] [SEP]
you acknowledge and agree that neither discovery nor any of its affiliates
shall assume or have any liability for any action or inaction by discovery
with respect to any conduct within the discovery sites or any communication or
posting on the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP] discovery also reserves the right to disclose
any information that discovery believes necessary to satisfy any law,
regulation or governmental request, or to refuse to post or to remove any

have submitted or posted. [CLS] [SEP] you also warrant that all moral rights in any
material that you submit to us or post have been waived. [CLS] [SEP] submitting or posting
material that is the property of another, without the consent of its owner, is
not only a violation of this visitor agreement, but may also subject you to
legal liability for infringement of copyright, trademark or other intellectual
property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

**use of materials  
**with the exception of any and all video submissions (discovery’s permitted
use of which is discussed above) and any material posted on discovery’s
community and social media sites, all other material you submit to any of our
chat rooms, forums, blogs and other public posting areas, whether text or

distributed as we see fit, in any medium, for any purpose and in perpetuity. [CLS] [SEP]
further, you understand that by posting material on discovery’s community and

such materials posted on discovery’s community and social media sites, in

proprietary rights in such posting or submission, including, but not limited
to, rights under copyright, trademark, service mark or patent laws under any

video to the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP]

the materials available through the discovery sites are the property of
discovery or its licensors, and are protected by copyright, trademark and
other intellectual property laws. [CLS] [SEP] you are free to display and print for your
personal, non-commercial use information you receive through the discovery

prior written consent of the owner. [CLS] [SEP] you may not distribute copies of materials
found on the discovery sites in any form (including by e-mail or other
electronic means), without prior written permission from the owner. [CLS] [SEP] of course,
you are free to encourage others to access the information themselves on the
discovery sites and to tell them how to find it. [CLS] [SEP]

**linking  
**we welcome links to the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP] you are usually free to establish a
hypertext link to any of the discovery sites so long as the link does not
state or imply any sponsorship or endorsement of your site by any of the
discovery sites or by discovery. [CLS] [SEP] however, you should check the copyright
notice on the page to which you wish to link to make sure that one of our
content providers does not have its own policies regarding direct links to
their content on the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP]

**you agree not to use the discovery sites to advertise, or to solicit anyone
to buy or sell, products or services, nor to solicit anyone to make donations

**no spamming or spimming  
**from time to time, users post their e-mail addresses in our chat rooms,

addresses for commercial or illegal purposes, such as sending unsolicited or
unrequested e-mail or instant messages. [CLS] [SEP]

**no framing  
**without the prior written permission of discovery, you may not frame, or
make it appear that a third-party site is presenting or endorsing, any of the
content of the discovery sites, or incorporate any intellectual property of
the discovery sites, discovery or any of their licensors into another website
or other service. [CLS] [SEP]

**trademarks  
**we do not want anyone to be confused as to which materials and services are
provided by discovery and which are not. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use any trademark or
service mark appearing on the discovery sites without the prior written
consent of the owner of the mark. [CLS] [SEP]

**accuracy of information  
**the discovery staff works hard to ensure that information we post to the
discovery sites is both timely and accurate. [CLS] [SEP] but the news changes over time
and reports that were accurate when posted may quickly become old news. [CLS] [SEP] though
we may post follow-up reports, and may continue to provide access to the
original report, as in an archive of news stories, for example, we do not go
back and change the original report to reflect new developments. [CLS] [SEP] if you are
looking for the most recent information on a given subject, and not the
history of how the story unfolded, be sure you’re not looking at an out-of-
date report. [CLS] [SEP]

**age restriction  
**you must be at least 13 years old to register on the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP] by
registering on the discovery sites, you warrant that you are at least 13 years
old. [CLS] [SEP] ****

**to obtain access to certain services on the discovery sites, you may be
given an opportunity to register with the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP] as part of any such
registration process, you will select a user name and a password. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that the information you supply during that registration process will be
accurate and complete. [CLS] [SEP] you also agree not to (i) select, register, or attempt
to register, or use a user name of another person with the intention of
impersonating that person; (ii) use a user name of anyone else without
authorization; (iii) use a user name in violation of the intellectual property
rights of any person; or (iv) use a user name that discovery considers to be
offensive. [CLS] [SEP] discovery reserves the right to reject or terminate any user name
or password that, in its judgment, it deems offensive. [CLS] [SEP] you will be responsible
for preserving the confidentiality of your password and will notify discovery
of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account. [CLS] [SEP] further, you agree
that you are responsible for all statements made and acts or omissions that
occur on your account while your password is being used. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe
someone has used your password or account without your authorization, you must
notify discovery immediately. [CLS] [SEP] discovery reserves the right to access and
disclose any information including, without limitation, user names of accounts
and other information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government
requests. [CLS] [SEP] please inform discovery if there is a change in the information you
provided at the time of your initial registration, including any change of
address or name, by contacting our representatives at (240) 662-8909 or

**disclaimer of warranties and liability  
**we work hard to make the discovery sites interesting and enjoyable places,
but we cannot guarantee that our users will always find everything to their
liking. [CLS] [SEP] please read this disclaimer carefully before using any of the
discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that your use of the discovery sites is at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP] because
of the number of possible sources of information available through the
discovery sites, and the inherent hazards and uncertainties of electronic
distribution, there may be delays, omissions, inaccuracies or other problems
with such information. [CLS] [SEP] if you rely on any discovery site or any material
available through the discovery sites, you do so at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] you
understand that you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer
system or loss of data that results from any material and/or data downloaded
from or otherwise provided through the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP]

the discovery sites are provided to you as is, with all faults, and as
available. [CLS] [SEP] the discovery sites, discovery communications, llc and their
affiliates, agents and licensors cannot and do not warrant the accuracy,
completeness, currentness, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose of the information available through the discovery sites,
nor do they guarantee that the discovery sites will be error-free or
continuously available, or that the discovery sites will be free of viruses or
other harmful components. [CLS] [SEP] under no circumstances will the discovery sites,
discovery communications, llc or their affiliates, agents or licensors be
liable to you or anyone else for any damages arising out of use of the
discovery sites, including, without limitation, liability for consequential,
special, incidental, indirect or similar damages, even if we are advised
beforehand of the possibility of such damages. [CLS] [SEP] (because some states do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above
limitation may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] in such states, the liability of the
discovery sites, discovery communications, llc and their affiliates, agents
and licensors is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such state law.)
you agree that the liability of the discovery sites, discovery communications,
llc and their affiliates, agents and licensors, if any, arising out of any
kind of legal claim in any way connected to the discovery sites will not
exceed the amount, if any, you paid to discovery communications, llc for the
use of the discovery sites. [CLS] [SEP]

**dispute resolution  
****please read this section carefully. [CLS] [SEP] it affects your rights and how claims
that you and discovery have against each other are resolved.** this section is
deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the federal
arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP] you and discovery agree that we intend that this section
satisfies the “writing” requirement of the federal arbitration act. [CLS] [SEP] this
section can only be amended by mutual agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

we believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive
way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP]
therefore, pursuant to this visitor agreement, if you have any dispute or
disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the
discovery sites, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships
with discovery, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to discovery
or that discovery may gather in connection with such use, interaction or
transaction (collectively, “discovery transactions or relationships”), you
will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the
claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class
action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] by using or
interacting with the discovery sites, or engaging in any other discovery
transactions or relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as
provided below. [CLS] [SEP]

we will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints,
disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. [CLS] [SEP] if those efforts fail,
by using the discovery sites, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or
disagreement you may have against discovery, and any claim that discovery may
have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with
this visitor agreement, our privacy notice, or any discovery transactions or
relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration
(“arbitration”) administered by jams or its successor (“jams”) and conducted
in accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules and procedures in
effect at the time the arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in
controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the jams comprehensive
arbitration rules and procedures then in effect (respectively, the “applicable
rules”). [CLS] [SEP] the applicable rules can be found at
[www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com). [CLS] [SEP] if jams is no longer in existence,
the arbitration shall be administered by the american arbitration association
or its successor (the “aaa”) instead, and conducted in accordance with the aaa
commercial arbitration rules in effect at that time (which shall be the
“applicable rules” in such circumstances). [CLS] [SEP] if jams (or, if applicable, aaa) at
the time the arbitration is filed has minimum standards of procedural fairness
for consumer arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in
dispute, discovery agrees to provide the benefit of such minimum standards to
you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration
provisions set forth in this section, provided, however, that in no event may
such minimum standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e)
or (i) below. [CLS] [SEP] furthermore, this section shall not prevent any party from
seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

you further agree that:

**_arbitrator will interpret this agreement_** **.** the arbitrator, and not
any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive
authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity,
interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this visitor
agreement and/or these arbitration provisions in this section hereof,
including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this visitor
agreement is void or voidable;

**_location of arbitration_** **.** the arbitration shall be held either: (i)
at a location determined by jams (or, if applicable, aaa) pursuant to the
applicable rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you
and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of
business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by
you and discovery; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the
arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by
telephone or by written submission;

**_governing law_** **.** the arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the
state of new york consistent with the federal arbitration act and applicable
statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails,
shall apply the law of the u.s., irrespective of any conflict of law
principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike,
motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary
judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion
consistent with new york or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii)
shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have
authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;

**_no class relief_** **.** the arbitration can resolve only your and/or
discovery’s individual claims, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to
entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to
consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
similarly situated;

**_written award_** **.** the arbitrator shall issue a written award supported
by a statement of decision setting forth the arbitrator’s complete
determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions
relevant to it (an “award”). [CLS] [SEP] judgment upon the award may be entered by any
court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant
party or its assets;

**_arbitration costs_** **.** in the event that you are able to demonstrate
that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, discovery will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent
the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the
arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were
frivolous or asserted in bad faith;

**_reasonable attorney’s fees_** **.** in the event you recover an award
greater than discovery’s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall
also have the right to include in the award discovery’s reimbursement of your
reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the
arbitration, but discovery shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees;

**_interpretation and enforcement of arbitration clause_** **.** with the
exception of “no class relief” above, if any part of this arbitration
provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise
conflicts with the applicable rules, then the balance of this arbitration
provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its
terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were
not contained herein. [CLS] [SEP] if, however, “no class relief” is found to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision
shall be null and void, and neither you nor discovery shall be entitled to
arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of
competent jurisdiction;

**_modification of arbitration clause with notice_** **.** discovery may
modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become
effective thirty (30) days after discovery has given notice of such
modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from
discovery transactions and relationships occurring after the effective date of
such notification; and

**_small claims matters are excluded. [CLS] [SEP] no class relief or joinder of claims_**
**.** notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option,
you may bring any claim you have against discovery in your local small claims
court within the u.s., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional
limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any
claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the
claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP]
