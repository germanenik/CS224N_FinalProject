## usf privacy policy

### internet privacy policy

the university of south florida does not collect personal information about
you when you visit an official usf website, unless you affirmatively choose to
make such information available to us. [CLS] [SEP]

our servers automatically recognize the domain and ip address from which you
accessed the website, and we record related information that helps us make our
site more accessible, such as information about operating systems, screen
resolutions and the volume and timing of access. [CLS] [SEP] this information does not
result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or any other
personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

many pages within usf.edu use google analytics ([google analytics security and
privacy
principles](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en)). [CLS] [SEP]

if you choose to share information with us - either by sending us a message or
filling out an electronic form with personal information - we will use the
information only for the purposes you authorized. [CLS] [SEP] some of the information may
be saved for a designated period of time to comply with florida's archiving
policies, but we will not disclose the information to third parties or
government agencies unless required to do so by state or federal law or by
your specific permission. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
_under florida law, email addresses are public records. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want
your email address released in response to a public-records request, do not
send electronic mail to the university. [CLS] [SEP] instead, make contact by phone or in
writing._

please be aware that as a large, public research university, there are many
websites within the usf.edu domain. [CLS] [SEP] this policy relates to those websites on
which usf conducts its official business. [CLS] [SEP] because we encourage the development
and deployment of technology in an environment of academic freedom, we cannot
ensure that all websites within the usf.edu domain are in strict compliance
with this policy at all times. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
the university reserves the right to amend these privacy terms at any time
without notice. [CLS] [SEP] privacy and public records obligations of the university are
governed by applicable florida statutes and u.s. [CLS] [SEP] federal laws. [CLS] [SEP]

### processing payments

credit card and security notice statements

usf has strict guidelines on who can collect online payments for products and
services. [CLS] [SEP] usf information technology uses payment transaction software that
meets all government and banking institution requirements for compliance (this
includes payment card industry data security standards compliance and graham,
leach, bliley act). [CLS] [SEP] the payment card industry data security standard (pci dss)
is a worldwide information security standard defined by the [payment card
industry security standards council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). [CLS] [SEP]
the standard was created to help payment card industry organizations that
process card payments prevent credit card fraud through increased controls
around data and its exposure to compromise. [CLS] [SEP]

if you make a payment in an online transaction with usf, we may share
information regarding these payments with payment gateways and resellers for
the express purpose of completing a transaction or verifying that a
transaction is not fraudulent. [CLS] [SEP] in each case these companies do not share or
resell private information for any purpose outside of completing the
transaction. [CLS] [SEP] if we are required by law to disclose certain information
collected in an online transaction to local, state, federal, national or
international government or law enforcement authorities, usf will do so. [CLS] [SEP]

### security

the university of south florida takes credit card information security
seriously. [CLS] [SEP] we have implemented a variety of technical and procedural controls
to ensure transactions collected on our site are private and protected. [CLS] [SEP] to
ensure information you provide online is secure during transmission, usf
employs leading edge, encryption technology and secure socket layers (ssl)
while processing personal information supplied by you. [CLS] [SEP]

for technical assistance, please e-mail us at:
[webservices@usf.edu](mailto:webservices@usf.edu)

***note** : do not include your payment account #s in correspondence to the
university. [CLS] [SEP] it would be helpful to always include your name and uid to ensure
we are assisting the correct person. [CLS] [SEP]
