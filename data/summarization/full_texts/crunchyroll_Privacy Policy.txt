[CLS] [SEP] cookies are small text files stored locally on your device that help store user preferences. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more about cookies at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/> and <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons or "clear gifs" are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. [CLS] [SEP] an embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the services, such as the links you click on. [CLS] [SEP] the code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] we may use tracking technologies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our services and to improve or customize the content, offerings and advertisements on our services.

  * you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.
