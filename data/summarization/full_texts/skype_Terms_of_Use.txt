## **please read carefully before downloading the software or using the
product(s) or skype websites**

## **key points**

it is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. [CLS] [SEP]
there are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:

**no access to emergency services:** the software is not a replacement for
your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, apart from in the
very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these terms (applicable
to skype's internet communications software only), the software does not allow
you to make emergency calls to emergency services. [CLS] [SEP] you must make alternative
communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if
needed. [CLS] [SEP]

**check restrictions on use:** in some countries there are restrictions on the
use of the software. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally
allowed to use the software where you are located. [CLS] [SEP]

**no ownership of numbers:** if skype allocates to you a skype number
(previously known as "online number") or skype to go number, you do not own
the number or have a right to retain that number forever. [CLS] [SEP] skype may need to
change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] you will not
transfer or attempt to transfer your skype number or skype to go number to
anyone else. [CLS] [SEP] you must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements
displayed when purchasing a skype number as failure to do so could result in
the number being withdrawn. [CLS] [SEP] please see also paragraph 19.1. [CLS] [SEP]

**skype credit becomes inactive after 180 days:** if you purchase skype credit
please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. [CLS] [SEP] please
see also paragraph 9.2. [CLS] [SEP]

**arbitration clause and class action waiver:** if you live in the usa and
select pay by mobile (see paragraph 20), a binding arbitration clause and
class action waiver affects your rights to resolve a dispute with skype, its
corporate affiliates, or other third parties including mobile phone carriers. [CLS] [SEP]
please read paragraph 20.3 carefully. [CLS] [SEP]

## **1\. [CLS] [SEP] your agreement with skype**

**1.1** skype's internet communication software applications (" **internet
communications software** "), other "skype" branded software applications
(together the " **skype software** "), the " **qik** " branded software
applications (" **qik software** ") and associated documentation (whether in
printed or electronic form) including any improvements, modifications,
enhancements, fixes, updates, upgrades and future versions thereto ("
**updates** ") and whether made available for free or for a fee, (collectively
the " **software** ") are licensed (not sold) to you by skype software sàrl. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.2** the features and products that are made available through the software
for free (excluding products or features available for free on a trial basis
only) (" **free products** ") are provided to you by skype software sàrl. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.3** any additional products or features of the skype software or qik
software, or other "skype" or "qik" branded products, that you pay for
(including products or features available for free on a trial basis only) ("
**paid for products** ") are provided to you by skype communications sàrl. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.4** "skype websites" means www.skype.com, www.qik.com (both of which are
operated by skype communications sàrl) and any other websites authorised by
skype which link to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.5 "skype''** means skype software sàrl, 23 - 29 rives de clausen, l-2165
luxembourg or skype communications sàrl, 23 - 29 rives de clausen, l-2165
luxembourg as the context requires;  
**" products"** means collectively the free products and paid for products;  
**" you"** or **" your"** means you, the registered holder of the user account
(as described in paragraph 6.1) and licensee under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**1.6** your agreement with skype is made up of the terms and conditions set
out in this document, together with any fair usage policies described in this
document and additional terms referred to in paragraph 14 (collectively the
"terms"). [CLS] [SEP] to the extent of any inconsistency between the fair usage policies
or any additional terms and this document, this document shall take
precedence. [CLS] [SEP]

## **2\. [CLS] [SEP] acceptance of the terms**

**2.1** in order to download and/or use the software, products and/or skype
websites you must first accept these terms. [CLS] [SEP] these terms are accepted by you
(a) when you click to accept or agree to the terms; or (b) when you download
and/or use the software, products and/or skype websites. [CLS] [SEP] we advise you to
print a copy of these terms for your records. [CLS] [SEP] these terms remain effective
from the date of acceptance until terminated by you or skype in accordance
with paragraph 11. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.2** you cannot accept these terms if: (a) you are not lawfully entitled to
use the software, products and/or skype websites in the country in which you
are located or reside or (b) if you are not of legal age to form a binding
agreement with skype. [CLS] [SEP]

**2.3** in some countries the products may be provided to you by skype's local
partner. [CLS] [SEP] if so, that local partner may ask you to accept its own terms of
service ( **" local terms"**). [CLS] [SEP] if there is any inconsistency between those
local terms and these terms, then the local terms shall govern to the extent
of that inconsistency. [CLS] [SEP]



## **3\. [CLS] [SEP] changes to the terms**

**3.1** skype may make changes to these terms from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] skype will
publish the changes at www.skype.com/go/tou. [CLS] [SEP] changes to the fair usage
policies and/or additional terms will be posted on the applicable skype
website. [CLS] [SEP] the changes will be effective when published. [CLS] [SEP] please review the terms
on a regular basis. [CLS] [SEP] you understand and agree that your express acceptance of
the terms or your use of the software, products and/or skype websites after
the date of publication shall constitute your agreement to the updated terms. [CLS] [SEP]
if you do not agree with the amended terms, you may terminate your
relationship with skype in accordance with paragraph 11 below. [CLS] [SEP]

## **4\. [CLS] [SEP] licence**

**4.1** **licence**. [CLS] [SEP] subject to your compliance with these terms, you are
granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, free of
charge license to download and install the software on a personal computer,
mobile phone or other device; and personally use the software through your
individual skype or qik user account (as applicable) (" **user account** "). [CLS] [SEP]
for the avoidance of doubt, (a) it administrators working on behalf of a
company may download and install the skype software onto personal computers or
other devices used by personnel of such company; and (b) you are permitted to
use the software at a university or other educational institution, or at work. [CLS] [SEP]
skype reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.2 restrictions.** you may not and you agree not to:

(a) sub-license, sell, assign, rent, lease, export, import, distribute or
transfer or otherwise grant rights to any third party in the software;

(b) undertake, cause, permit or authorise the modification, creation of
derivative works or improvements, translation, reverse engineering,
decompiling, disassembling, decryption, emulation, hacking, discovery or
attempted discovery of the source code or protocols of the software or any
part or features thereof (except to the extent permitted by law);

(c) remove, obscure or alter any copyright notices or other proprietary
notices included in the software;

(d) use the software or cause the software (or any part of it) to be used
within or to provide commercial products or services to third parties. [CLS] [SEP] the
foregoing shall not preclude you using the software for your own business
communications, subject to paragraph 4.1 above;

(e) other than for the purposes of download and installation, use the software
except through your user account. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.3 third-party technology.** if you are using software pre-loaded on,
embedded in, combined, distributed or used with or downloaded onto third party
products, hardware, software applications, programs or devices (" **third-
party technology** "), you agree and acknowledge that: (a) you may be required
to enter into a separate licence agreement with the relevant third party owner
or licensor for the use of such third-party technology; (b) some products
and/or functionality may not be accessible through the third-party technology
and (c) skype cannot guarantee that the software shall always be available on
or in connection with such third-party technology. [CLS] [SEP]

**4.4 third party notices.** the software may include third party code that
skype, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] notices, if
any, for the third party code are included for your information only. [CLS] [SEP] third
party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the software, are licensed
to you by the third parties that own such code, not by skype. [CLS] [SEP]

## **5\. [CLS] [SEP] use of the software and products and skype websites**

**5.1 equipment:** in order to use the software and the products you will need
an internet broadband connection. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for providing all
equipment required to access the internet or enable communications such as
headsets, microphones and webcams. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.2 use of your equipment:** the internet communications software may use
the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other
applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the
communication and establishing the connection between internet communications
software users. [CLS] [SEP] if your use of the internet communications software is
dependent upon the use of a processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a
third party, you acknowledge and agree that your licence to use the internet
communications software is subject to you obtaining consent from the relevant
third party for such use. [CLS] [SEP] you represent and warrant that by accepting these
terms, you have obtained such consent. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.3 updates to the software:** skype may automatically check your version of
the skype software. [CLS] [SEP] you may be required to enter into an updated version of
these terms to be able to download or otherwise take advantage of any updates. [CLS] [SEP]
skype has no obligation to make available any updates. [CLS] [SEP] however, skype may (a)
require you to download and install updates; or (b) download and install
updates from skype automatically from time to time unless you have chosen
(through your skype client settings) not to receive automatic updates. [CLS] [SEP]
microsoft corporation or its affiliates and subsidiaries may also
automatically download updates to the skype software for windows, if you have
chosen to receive microsoft updates. [CLS] [SEP] these updates are required to maintain
software compatibility, provide security updates or bug fixes, or offer new
features, functionality or versions. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to receive such updates from
skype in order to continue using the skype software and you agree to accept
such updates subject to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.4 suspension, technical improvement and maintenance:** from time to time,
skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the software, products or
skype websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the
software, products or skype websites. [CLS] [SEP] this may require skype to temporarily
suspend or limit your use of some or all of the software, products or skype
websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed. [CLS] [SEP]
to the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, skype
will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the skype
website in advance. [CLS] [SEP] you will not be entitled to claim damages for such
suspension or limitation of the use of any software, product or skype website. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.5 no access to emergency services:** neither the products nor the software
are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law
enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that
connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering
points ("emergency services"). [CLS] [SEP] there are important differences between
traditional telephone services and the products. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree
that: (i) skype is not required to offer access to emergency services under
any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law; (ii) it is
your responsibility to purchase, separately from the products, traditional
wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to
emergency services, and (iii) the software and the products are not a
replacement for your primary telephone service. [CLS] [SEP] find out more about calling
112, the dedicated emergency number for the eu at www.skype.com/go/emergency. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.6 limited emergency calling (internet communications software only and not
applicable to the qik software)**

**5.6.1** in a very limited number of countries, and for defined internet
communications software versions and platforms only, skype will try to provide
limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no
commitment in this respect. [CLS] [SEP] click here for the listing of countries ("enabled
countries") and software versions and other platforms ("enabled versions")
that enable limited skype emergency calling. [CLS] [SEP] skype emergency calling is not
available for any other countries, versions or platforms. [CLS] [SEP] you should keep
traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for
your calls to emergency services and use skype's limited emergency calling
only as an absolute last resort. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, please also note that:

(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a
skype call failure, including your call to emergency services. [CLS] [SEP] additionally,
any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise
affect successful call connection. [CLS] [SEP]

(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the internet communications
software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a
call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone
services. [CLS] [SEP]

(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the emergency
services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that
the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows
where to find you. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not provide this information when prompted, you
acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be
able to gain access to your required emergency services using the internet
communications software. [CLS] [SEP] skype will have no liability for your failed
emergency call in such circumstances. [CLS] [SEP]

(iv) other than for the enabled countries and enabled versions, skype does not
provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with
any products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems
(including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems
developed by third parties using skype's apis, any of skype's software
development kits or otherwise). [CLS] [SEP]

**5.6.2** in enabled countries, you should configure the limited emergency
calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling
in the call settings page of your desktop internet communications software (if
you are using a 4.1 version for windows (or later) or version 2.8 for mac os x
(or later)). [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to ensure that this location
information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. [CLS] [SEP]
skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the
world. [CLS] [SEP] where limited emergency calling is supported skype will not charge you
to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a skype credit balance. [CLS] [SEP]
if however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then
you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using
your internet communications software. [CLS] [SEP] if, with your permission, another user
uses your user account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the
limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.7** content of communications: skype is not the source of, does not verify
or endorse and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made
using the software. [CLS] [SEP] by using the software, you agree that any content that you
submit may be transmitted to the recipient of your communication. [CLS] [SEP] the content
of communications is entirely the responsibility of the person from whom such
content originated. [CLS] [SEP] you therefore may be exposed to content that is offensive,
unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, indecent or otherwise objectionable. [CLS] [SEP] the
content of communications may be protected by intellectual property rights,
which are owned by third parties. [CLS] [SEP] you are responsible for the content you
choose to communicate and access using the software. [CLS] [SEP] in particular, you are
responsible for ensuring that you do not submit material that is (i)
copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party
proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the
owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner (ii) a
falsehood or misrepresentation (iii) offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors,
obscene, defamatory, libellous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful,
racially or ethnically offensive, or that encourages conduct that would be
considered a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, violates any
law, or is otherwise objectionable; (iv) an advertisement or solicitation of
business; or (v) impersonating another person. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right (but
shall have no obligation) to review content for the purpose of enforcing these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] skype may in its sole discretion block, prevent delivery of or
otherwise remove the content of communications as part of its effort to
protect the software, products or its customers, or otherwise enforce these
terms. [CLS] [SEP] further, skype may in its sole discretion remove such content and/or
terminate these terms and your user account if you use any content that is in
breach of these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.8 notice and take-down** if skype receives any notification that any
material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the skype
website or through the software (excluding your private communications) ("
**user submission** ") is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third
party, or if skype wishes to remove your user submission for any reason
whatsoever, skype reserves the right to automatically remove such user
submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may
be decided from time to time by skype in its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP] the user
submission shall be taken down without any admission as to liability and
without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are
expressly reserved. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that skype is under no
obligation to put back such user submission at any time. [CLS] [SEP] if user submissions
infringe, or if you believe that user submissions infringe any of your rights
(including intellectual property rights) or are unlawful, please contact us
immediately by following our notice and takedown procedure. [CLS] [SEP] click here to view
the notice and takedown procedure. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to ask for
verification of your identity and to seek further information to verify your
complaint. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you are solely responsible for the consequences
resulting from your complaint (including but not limited to removal or
blocking of the user submission) and you acknowledge and agree that any
complaint may be used in court proceedings. [CLS] [SEP] any false, misleading or
inaccurate information provided by you may result in civil and criminal
liability. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.9 quality:** skype cannot guarantee that the software, products or skype
websites will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. [CLS] [SEP] a number
of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the
software, products (depending on the products used) or skype websites, and may
result in the failure of your communications including but not limited to:
your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public
internet, the public switched telephone network and your power supply. [CLS] [SEP] skype
takes no responsibility for any disruption, interruption or delay caused by
any failure of or inadequacy in any of these items or any other items over
which we have no control. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.10 changes to products:** skype is constantly improving the software and
products and may also need to change technical features from time to time in
order to comply with applicable regulations. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, you acknowledge and
agree that the products and functionality of the software may vary from time
to time. [CLS] [SEP] technical requirements for use of products and software and feature
descriptions are available on the skype website. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not agree with any
changes to software and products you may terminate your relationship with
skype in accordance with paragraph 11. [CLS] [SEP] you may need to upgrade to a new
version in order to enjoy the benefit of certain products. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, you
acknowledge and agree that certain products may be subject to usage limits or
geographical restrictions, which may vary from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] please check the
skype website for details of the most up-to-date usage restrictions that apply
to the products that you are using. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.11 unsolicited ideas** skype does not consider or accept unsolicited
proposals or ideas, including without limitation ideas for new products,
technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product
improvements ("unsolicited feedback"). [CLS] [SEP] if you send any unsolicited feedback to
skype through the skype website or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that
skype shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the
unsolicited feedback. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.12 reports** certain parts of the skype websites or the software may ask
for written suggestions or problem reports such as using our contact form or
problem report form (" **reports** "). [CLS] [SEP] please read carefully any specific
terms, which govern those reports. [CLS] [SEP] the reports shall be deemed the property of
skype. [CLS] [SEP] skype shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights
to the reports throughout the universe in perpetuity and shall be entitled to
use the reports for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without
compensation to the provider of the reports. [CLS] [SEP] any reports you send to skype
will not be treated as confidential and skype shall not be liable for any
disclosure of the reports. [CLS] [SEP]

**5.13 linking** you may link to the skype website from another website owned
by you, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage
our reputation or take advantage of it. [CLS] [SEP] you must not establish a link in such
a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement by skype
where none exists. [CLS] [SEP] you may not frame the site on any other site. [CLS] [SEP] skype
provides a qik branded embeddable flash player feature which you may
incorporate into your own personal, non-commercial website for use in
accessing the materials on the qik branded skype website. [CLS] [SEP] skype may revoke the
permission to link to the skype websites at any time at its sole discretion
and will notify you in this respect. [CLS] [SEP]

## **6\. [CLS] [SEP] your obligations**

**6.1 user account.** prior to your first use of the skype software and your
first use of the qik software, you will be asked to create a user account and
choose a user id and password. [CLS] [SEP] we recommend that you choose a password that is
hard to guess and consists of letters, numbers and symbols. [CLS] [SEP] you may only use
the software through your user account. [CLS] [SEP] you are solely responsible and liable
for all activities conducted through your user account. [CLS] [SEP] to prevent
unauthorised use, you shall keep your password confidential and shall not
share it with any third party or use it to access third party websites or
services. [CLS] [SEP] if you suspect that someone else knows your password, then you shall
immediately change it in order to protect the security of your user account. [CLS] [SEP]
it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not respond to any unsolicited
requests for credit card details, passwords or other data. [CLS] [SEP] skype takes no
responsibility for your failure to comply with the obligations in this
paragraph 6.1. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.2 lawful use:** you must use the software, products and skype websites in
accordance with the laws of where you are located. [CLS] [SEP] in some countries there are

websites. [CLS] [SEP] it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to
use the software, products and/or skype websites where you are located. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.3 prohibited use:** you may not:

(a) intercept or monitor, damage or modify any communication which is not
intended for you;

(b) use any type of spider, virus, worm, trojan-horse, time bomb or any other

(d) expose any third party to material which is offensive, harmful to minors,
indecent or otherwise objectionable in any way;

(e) use the software, products or skype websites to cause or intend to cause
embarrassment or distress to, or to threaten, harass or invade the privacy of,

(f) use (including as part of your user id and/or profile picture) any
material or content that is subject to any third party proprietary rights,
unless you have a licence or permission from the owner of such rights; or

(g) collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including
account names, from the software, products or skype websites;

(h) impact or attempt to impact the availability of the software, products or
skype websites for example, with a denial of service (dos) or distributed
denial of service (ddos) attack;

(i) use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, robots,
spiders or offline readers that access the software, products or skype
websites. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that skype grants to the
operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials
from the skype website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available
searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such
materials. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to revoke these exceptions at any time. [CLS] [SEP]

**6.4 user submissions** please exercise respect when participating in any
features of the skype websites or software such as forums, blogs, email
functions, video hosting, sharing and/or publishing or any other function on
the skype websites or of the skype software which allows you to post, upload,
edit, host, share and/or publish content. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that: (i)
by using the skype websites and/or software you may be exposed to content that
you may find offensive or indecent and you do so at your own risk; (ii) you
are solely responsible for, and skype has no responsibility to you or any
third party for any user submissions that you create, submit, post or publish
on the skype websites or through the software; (iii) skype does not guarantee
any confidentiality with respect to user submissions, whether or not they are
published (iv) skype is not responsible for any user submissions that you may
have access to through your use of the skype websites or software and all user
submissions are the responsibility of the person from whom such user
submissions originated. [CLS] [SEP] skype does not endorse any user submissions or any
opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and expressly disclaims
any and all liability in connection with user submissions. [CLS] [SEP]

in connection with your user submissions, you represent and warrant that you

(i) own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to
use and authorise skype to use all copyrights, trade marks, trade secrets,

## **8\. [CLS] [SEP] charges**

**8.1 calling phones and premium rate numbers with skype credit:**

(i) **calling landlines and mobiles:** the charges payable for calling phones
(outside of a subscription) consist of a connection fee (charged once, per
call) and a per-minute rate as set out on www.skype.com/go/allrates. [CLS] [SEP] all calls
will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration and an
additional connection fee will be charged on re-dial. [CLS] [SEP]

(ii) **premium rate numbers:** the charges payable for calling premium rate
numbers consist of a per-minute rate available at www.skype.com/go/rates-
premium. [CLS] [SEP] no connection fee is payable. [CLS] [SEP]

(iii) skype may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers
at any time without notice to you by posting such change at
www.skype.com/go/allrates. [CLS] [SEP] the new rate will apply to your next purchase after
the new rates have been published. [CLS] [SEP] please check the latest rates before you
make your call. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call. [CLS] [SEP]

(iv) the duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. [CLS] [SEP] fractions
of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. [CLS] [SEP] the connection fee, where
applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call. [CLS] [SEP] at the end of a
call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
for example a total call price of €0.034 will be rounded up to €0.04. [CLS] [SEP] during
the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the skype
credit balance in your user account. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.2 charges for other paid for products:** the charges for other paid for
products will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from skype. [CLS] [SEP]
skype may change the charges payable for the purchase of such products at any
time without any notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] you can choose whether or not to accept the
new charges prior to completing your next purchase of the applicable product. [CLS] [SEP]
the new charges will apply to your next purchase after the new charges have
been published. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.3 promotional offers:** from time to time, skype may offer paid-for
products for free for a trial period. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to charge you
for such products (at the normal rate) in the event that skype determines (in
its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer,
including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous ip
address that prevents us from locating you. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.4 tax:** skype may collect vat or other indirect taxes at the appropriate
rate (as per applicable tax rules) at the time of purchase of skype credit. [CLS] [SEP]
15% luxembourg vat generally applies if you are located in the eu and the
products are purchased and used in the eu. [CLS] [SEP] 8% swiss vat applies if you are
located in switzerland. [CLS] [SEP] other local taxes may apply in certain countries. [CLS] [SEP] when
you purchase a voucher or pre-paid card, depending on the country, 15%
luxembourg vat, local vat or other taxes may apply and may be deducted from
the value of the voucher or prepaid card upon redemption. [CLS] [SEP] you explicitly waive
any right to vat reimbursement from skype if the amount of vat ultimately
payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower
than the amount of vat collected from you at the time of purchase. [CLS] [SEP] your skype
credit balance is displayed exclusive of any such taxes. [CLS] [SEP] the territories in
the eu set out below are outside the scope of eu vat under council directive
2006/112/ec on the common system of vat, as amended. [CLS] [SEP] the skype website does
not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this vat exemption
and we therefore do not provide the products in such territories: mount athos,
canary islands, french overseas departments, aland islands, channel islands,
heligoland island, büsingen / buesingen territory, ceuta, melilla, livigno,
campione d'italia and italian waters of lake lugano. [CLS] [SEP]

**8.5 third-party charges:** using the software on mobile applications will
use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have
subscribed with your mobile network operator. [CLS] [SEP] out-of-country usage may lead to
significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible
for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other
applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator. [CLS] [SEP]

## **9\. [CLS] [SEP] payment**

**9.1 skype credit.** you can pay for select paid-for products using skype
credit. [CLS] [SEP] you can purchase skype credit using any payment method made available
to you by skype from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] the skype credit that you purchase will be
credited to your user account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a
skype credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher). [CLS] [SEP]

**9.2 inactive skype credit.** if you do not use your skype credit for a
period of 180 days, (including skype credit that has been allocated to you by
a skype manager administrator) skype will place your skype credit on inactive
status. [CLS] [SEP] you can reactivate the skype credit by following the reactivation link
in my account at https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate. [CLS] [SEP]

you buy skype credit from the skype website, this paragraph does not apply to
you and your skype credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. [CLS] [SEP] you
are not permitted to use any skype credit on or after the date of its expiry. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.3 other payment methods.** skype does not guarantee that you will be able
to use your skype credit balance to purchase all products. [CLS] [SEP] where skype credit
cannot be used to pay for a product, skype will make another payment method
available to you. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available
payment methods at its sole discretion. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.4 recurring payments.** where you purchase products on a subscription
basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge
and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to skype
by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until
the subscription for that product is terminated by you or by skype. [CLS] [SEP]

**9.5 auto-recharge.**

(a) the auto-recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy skype
credit, unless you untick the appropriate box. [CLS] [SEP] your skype credit balance will
be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when
you first sign up for auto-recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount
by accessing your user account. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if you purchase 10 euros of skype
credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card
will also be 10 euros of skype credit. [CLS] [SEP] in future the same amount will be
charged to your credit card every time your skype account balance goes below
the threshold set by skype from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not want to enable
auto-recharge, please untick the box. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) if you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit
card, paypal or moneybookers (skrill), and you have enabled auto-recharge,
your skype credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to
purchase your next recurring subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) you can disable auto-recharge at any time by accessing your user account. [CLS] [SEP]

**10.2** outside of the cooling-off period, only subscriptions are refundable

the cooling-off period. [CLS] [SEP]

**10.4** the cooling-off period and refunds do not apply to paid-for-products

paid cards) (iii) paid for in cash using third party payment methods (such as
a cash payment wallet) and (iv) paid for and allocated to your skype account

skype developer. [CLS] [SEP]

skype within 90 days of such charge. [CLS] [SEP] no refunds will be given for any charges
more than 90 days old. [CLS] [SEP]

**10.6** skype reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably
believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for

**19.3 subscriptions**

(a) **fair usage policy.** at skype, we want all of our customers to get the
best calling plans, known as 'subscriptions', at the lowest possible price. [CLS] [SEP]
this fair usage policy ("fup") is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our
subscriptions by a small number of users. [CLS] [SEP]

subject to this fup, skype's unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to
landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special,
premium, service and non-geographic numbers). [CLS] [SEP] unlimited calls to mobiles may
also be included where stated at the time of purchase. [CLS] [SEP] all calls will be
disconnected and require a re-dial after a 2-hour duration. [CLS] [SEP]

skype's subscriptions are for individual use only (personal or business
communications) in accordance with our terms of use and this fup ("legitimate
use"). [CLS] [SEP] the following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be
considered legitimate use:

(i) using subscriptions for telemarketing or call centre operations;

(ii) re-selling subscription minutes;

(iii) sharing subscriptions between users whether via a pbx, call centre,
computer or any other means;

(iv) calling numbers (whether singly, sequentially or automatically) to
generate income for yourself or others as a result of merely placing the call,
other than for your individual business communications (and subject to
paragraph 4.1 of the terms of use); and

(v) unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription
use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers
in a short period of time. [CLS] [SEP]

other practices may be relevant in determining legitimate use and skype
reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual
activity into account in making its determination. [CLS] [SEP] skype may at its option,
terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription
immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this
fup or skype's terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] where reasonable, skype will provide you with
notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription
and, if appropriate, skype may offer you an alternative subscription. [CLS] [SEP]

(b) skype reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any
time. [CLS] [SEP] if skype changes the products included in your subscription, skype will
notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date. [CLS] [SEP] if you do
not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your
subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take
effect. [CLS] [SEP]

(c) the "unlimited world extra" subscription has a minimum fixed term of 2
years from the date of purchase. [CLS] [SEP] you are not permitted to terminate it before
the expiry of the 2-year minimum term except in case of breach by skype of the
terms. [CLS] [SEP] this subscription is billed monthly as a recurring payment. [CLS] [SEP]

the wifi provider and their terms of service. [CLS] [SEP] you will have to read their
terms of service, which you agree to be subject to by proceeding with the
skype wifi session. [CLS] [SEP] you can pay for skype wifi using your skype credit
balance, and your use of skype credit is subject to these terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]

it will be broken down into several sms messages and you will be charged for
each message sent. [CLS] [SEP] if you send sms messages to more than one person you will
be charged for each sms sent to each recipient. [CLS] [SEP] if skype cannot (for whatever
reason) send your sms, skype will continue to try and send the message for up
to 24 hours after which time the sms charge will be refunded to your skype
credit balance automatically if delivery is unsuccessful. [CLS] [SEP]

**19.6 group video calling**

(a) a fair usage policy applies at www.skype.com/go/terms.gvc.fairusage and is
incorporated herein by reference. [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to change the fair
usage policy at any time. [CLS] [SEP] changes shall become effective when published on the
skype website. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of a skype premium subscription after

participant on the call who owns a skype premium subscription), then the call
will convert from video to audio. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) software versions. [CLS] [SEP] if a participant of a group video call is not on a
version of internet communications software that supports group video calls,
then the call will be an audio call only for that participant. [CLS] [SEP] for details of

qik premium is subject to a fair usage policy of 15gb of video storage per
user per month and each video can be no more than 90 minutes in duration. [CLS] [SEP] once
these limits have been reached you cannot upload any new videos in that month
or continue recording beyond the 90-minute mark. [CLS] [SEP]

skype reserves the right to change the fair usage policy at any time. [CLS] [SEP] changes
shall become effective when published on the skype website. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use
of qik premium after publication on the skype website shall constitute your
acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of the revised fair usage
policy. [CLS] [SEP]

if you are not a skype premium subscriber, the number of video messages you
can send are limited and will be subject to an expiry date. [CLS] [SEP]

messaging. [CLS] [SEP] video messaging is for personal, individual and non-commercial use
only, and to be in accordance with these terms at all times ("legitimate
use"). [CLS] [SEP] skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or
unusual activity into account in making its determination as to whether your
activity does not constitute legitimate use. [CLS] [SEP] skype may in its option,
terminate its relationship with you, or suspend your account immediately if it
determines you are using video messaging contrary to this fup or these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

**20.2** by selecting or using pay by mobile:

(a) you authorise your mobile phone carrier to charge appropriate fees
directly to your mobile phone bill; and

(b) you represent that you are the person or entity responsible for the mobile

accounts.** if you select pay by mobile and your mobile phone account is
registered with a mobile phone carrier in the usa or you reside in the usa,
the following additional terms apply:

(a) paragraph 20.3 applies to any dispute arising between you and either skype
or any third party including mobile phone carriers and skype's corporate
affiliates (collectively, **" disputed party"** or **" disputed parties"**)
relating to your use of pay by mobile, except it does not include a dispute
relating to the enforcement or validity of your, skype's, or either of our
licensors' intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP] **dispute** , for purposes of
paragraph 20.3, means any dispute, action, or other controversy whether in

of residence, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small
claims court. [CLS] [SEP] you may litigate in a small claims court whether or not you
negotiated informally first. [CLS] [SEP]

(d) **binding arbitration.** if you and a disputed party do not resolve any
dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to
resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration
governed by the united states federal arbitration act ("faa"). [CLS] [SEP] you are giving
up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all
disputes in court before a judge or jury. [CLS] [SEP] instead, all disputes will be
resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for
a limited right of appeal under the faa. [CLS] [SEP] any court with jurisdiction over the
parties may enforce the arbitrator's award. [CLS] [SEP]

(e) **class action waiver.** any proceedings to resolve or litigate any
dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. [CLS] [SEP] neither
you nor a disputed party will seek to have any dispute heard as a class
action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which
either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. [CLS] [SEP] no
arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior
written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. [CLS] [SEP]

and use the software or products for personal or household use, or if the
value of the dispute is $75,000 usd or less whether or not you are an
individual or how you use them, its supplementary procedures for consumer-
related disputes will also apply. [CLS] [SEP] for more information, see adr.org or call
+1-800-778-7879. [CLS] [SEP] in a dispute involving $75,000 usd or less, skype will
promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the aaa's and arbitrator's fees. [CLS] [SEP]
you and skype agree to the terms governing procedures, fees and incentives at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=275219. [CLS] [SEP]  to commence arbitration, submit the
form available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=275627 to the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
to commence arbitration only in your county of residence, in santa clara
county, california, or another disputed party's principal place of business in
the usa. [CLS] [SEP] skype and other disputed parties agree to commence arbitration only
in your county of residence. [CLS] [SEP]

(g) to the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to your use
of pay by mobile must be filed within one year in small claims court
(paragraph 20.3(c)) or in arbitration (paragraph 20.3(d)). [CLS] [SEP] the one-year period
begins when the claim or dispute first could be filed. [CLS] [SEP] if such a claim or
dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]

(h) **rejecting future arbitration changes.** you may reject any change skype
makes to paragraph 20.3 (other than address changes) by sending us notice
within 30 days of the change by u.s. [CLS] [SEP] mail to the address in paragraph 20.3(b). [CLS] [SEP]
if you do, the most recent version of paragraph 20.3 before the change you
rejected will apply. [CLS] [SEP]

(i) if the class action waiver in paragraph 20.3(e) is found to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then paragraph
20.3 will not apply to those parts. [CLS] [SEP] instead, those parts will be severed and
proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
if any other provision of paragraph 20.3 is found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of paragraph
20.3 remaining in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP]

**you expressly acknowledge that you have read these terms and understand the
rights, obligations, terms and conditions set forth herein. [CLS] [SEP] by clicking on the
accept button and/or continuing to install the software or use the software,
products and/or skype websites, you expressly consent to be bound by its terms
and conditions and grant to skype the rights set forth herein.**
