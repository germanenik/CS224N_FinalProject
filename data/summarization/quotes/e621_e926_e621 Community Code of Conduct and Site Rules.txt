[CLS] [SEP] p> major religions, religious figures, political parties, or political figures  suggested suspension length: 3 days this category includes:  any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major religions or religious figures any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major political parties or political figures   the main point behind this is, while we do encourage free speech and we have no problem with someone saying “thank god” or “jesus blesses you”, we have to draw the line at an actual discussion, as it often leads to passionate and heated debate and a general distraction from what is ultimately a furry art archive. [CLS] [SEP] the same goes for politics, we know that people want to talk about it, and often do, but there are places for that and they are not here. [CLS] [SEP] </p. [CLS] [SEP]
