[CLS] [SEP] when you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information in addition to the information mentioned elsewhere in this policy. [CLS] [SEP] we may use mobile analytics software (such as fabric.io app statistics and crash reporting, play store app statistics, app store app statistics, or self-hosted sentry crash reporting) to send crash information to our developers so that we can fix bugs rapidly. [CLS] [SEP] should you choose to provide it, we do associate another email address with your account (for password recovery, or notifications). [CLS] [SEP] the legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to remove that data in the account panel of your protonmail account. [CLS] [SEP]  account activity: due to limitations of the smtp protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the ip address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times. [CLS] [SEP] we do not have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to protonmail are scanned for spam and viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of our users. [CLS] [SEP] we also have access to the following records of account activity: number of messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of messages, last login time. [CLS] [SEP]  communicating with protonmail: your communications with the company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff. [CLS] [SEP] account creation: it is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, but you may provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes. [CLS] [SEP]  data disclosure we will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are instructed to do so by a fully binding request coming from the competent swiss authorities (legal obligation). [CLS] [SEP] while we may comply with electronically delivered notices (see exceptions below), the disclosed data can only be used in court after we have received an original copy of the court order by registered post or in person, and provide a formal response. [CLS] [SEP] if a request is made for encrypted message content that protonmail does not possess the ability to decrypt, the fully encrypted message content may be turned over. [CLS] [SEP] active accounts will have data retained indefinitely. [CLS] [SEP] deleted emails are also permanently deleted from production servers. [CLS] [SEP] deleted data may be retained in our backups for up to 14 days.

[CLS] [SEP] in case of violation of your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint to the competent supervisory authority. [CLS] [SEP] none of the software on our apps will ever access or track any location-based information from your device at any time. [CLS] [SEP] when a protonmail account is closed, data is immediately deleted from production servers. [CLS] [SEP] such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about protonmail, to send you information related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your protonmail account, to verify your protonmail account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option.
