our anonymous, numbered accounts we want you to remain anonymous. [CLS] [SEP] when you sign up for mullvad, we do not ask for any personal information&nbsp;â€“ no username, no password, no email address. [CLS] [SEP] instead, a random&nbsp;account number is generated, a so-called numbered account. [CLS] [SEP] this number is the only identifier a person needs in order to use a mullvad account. [CLS] [SEP] p> anyone at anytime can create as many numbered accounts as they wish on our website.&nbsp;an account can be used by multiple people or by someone other than the person who initially generated it. [CLS] [SEP] <p. [CLS] [SEP] what we don't log we log nothing whatsoever that can be connected to a numbered account's activity:  no logging of traffic no logging of dns requests no logging of connections, including when one is made, when it disconnects, for how long, or any kind of timestamp no logging of ip addresses no logging of user bandwidth no logging of account activity except total simultaneous connections (explained below) and the payment information detailed in this post.
