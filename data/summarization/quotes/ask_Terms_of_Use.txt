[CLS] [SEP] sorry, but you can’t use askfm if you are under 13 years old. [CLS] [SEP] if you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to access or use the services. [CLS] [SEP] if we become aware that you are using the services even though you are under 13 and not permitted to do so, we will deactivate your account and attempt to block you from accessing the services.

[CLS] [SEP] (parents and guardians might also find some useful information&nbsp;here). [CLS] [SEP] sharing your password might lead to all of your posts, messages and personal information being leaked or someone impersonating or pretending to be you. [CLS] [SEP] if you don’t keep your password confidential or give it to anyone other than your parent or guardian, we are not responsible for anyone accessing or using your account, including reading or sending messages from it.

[CLS] [SEP] warning: after you have deactivated your account or left the services, questions may still appear on the services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend’s profile will still be visible, but will not include your username).
