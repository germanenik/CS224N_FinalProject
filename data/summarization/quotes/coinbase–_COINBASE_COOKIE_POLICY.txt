we use the following types of cookies:   strictly necessary cookies    these cookies are essential because they enable you to move around our services and use certain features on our services. [CLS] [SEP] for example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas. [CLS] [SEP] without these cookies, some services cannot be provided. [CLS] [SEP]    performance/analytics cookies    these cookies collect information about how you use a website. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a performance/analytics cookie will collect information about which pages you go to most often, how much time you spend on that page, or if you get error messages from certain pages. [CLS] [SEP] these cookies do not gather information that identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] the information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our services work. [CLS] [SEP]    functionality cookies    these cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our services so we can provide relevant content to you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, a functionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username. [CLS] [SEP] session cookies. [CLS] [SEP] we use session cookies when you access our website or content. [CLS] [SEP] session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. [CLS] [SEP] in addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, like web beacons to track users of our services. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons, or "clear gifs," are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. [CLS] [SEP] they are used to track the online movements of web users. [CLS] [SEP] in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive or device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. [CLS] [SEP] we and our third-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated above (under "cookies"), but primarily to help us better manage content on our services by informing us which content is effective. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use so-called "flash cookies" (also known as "local shared objects or "lsos") to collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.
