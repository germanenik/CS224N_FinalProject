last modified: may 19, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] we may modify or revise these terms of service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. [CLS] [SEP] although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these terms of service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at http://www.thumbzilla.com/information#terms, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. [CLS] [SEP] if we change anything in these terms of service, the change will be reflected in the “last modified date”. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms. [CLS] [SEP] if the “last modified” date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. [CLS] [SEP] on the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones. [CLS] [SEP] all changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the website thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] the updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. [CLS] [SEP] you are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. [CLS] [SEP] by continuing to use the website subsequent to us making available an amended version of these terms of service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment. [CLS] [SEP] we have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these terms of service.
