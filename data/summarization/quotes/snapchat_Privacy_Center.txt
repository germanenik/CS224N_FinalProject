They say that „Mainly“ they can only see basic information. [CLS] [SEP] Obviously that implies that they may save any other data as well so that exceptions to the „Mainly“ are possible. [CLS] [SEP] we may change this privacy policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] but when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. [CLS] [SEP]  like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. [CLS] [SEP] we may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. [CLS] [SEP] for example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant ads. [CLS] [SEP] provide and improve our advertising services, ad targeting, and ad measurement, including through the use of your precise location information (again, if you’ve given us permission to collect that information),. [CLS] [SEP] you have the right to control your information. [CLS] [SEP] that’s why we provide easy ways to access and update your information, adjust how much information you share with us, and request that we delete your information — or your account, altogether.

[CLS] [SEP] we may collect information about you from other users, our affiliates, and third parties. [CLS] [SEP] here are a few examples:  if you link your snapchat account to another service (like bitmoji or a third-party app), we may receive information from the other service, like how you use that service. [CLS] [SEP] advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties may share information with us as well. [CLS] [SEP]
