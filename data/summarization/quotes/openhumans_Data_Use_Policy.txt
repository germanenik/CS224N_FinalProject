changes to this policy  we may revise this data use policy from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] the most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://openhumans.org/data-use/. [CLS] [SEP] if we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will email you and prominently display a notice on our site 7 days before we make those changes. [CLS] [SEP] account disabling  you may disable your open humans account at any time. [CLS] [SEP] we may also continue to display some information you have made publicly available through open humans (comments, for example). [CLS] [SEP] this means your user profile will no longer be visible on our site, and other open humans users will no longer have access on our site to the personal data you’ve shared with them. [CLS] [SEP]  . [CLS] [SEP]  this may include using your information for analytical purposes. [CLS] [SEP] as long as you follow our naming guidelines, you’re free to choose a pseudonym as your name and username. [CLS] [SEP] even if you use a pseudonym for open humans, your data could be connected to your identity. [CLS] [SEP] the risk of this varies depending on the type of data, but it is often surprisingly easy to identify people. [CLS] [SEP] we receive some information automatically when you visit open humans. [CLS] [SEP] this includes information about the device, browser, and operating system you use when accessing our site, your ip address, the website that referred you to open humans (if any), which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to open humans. [CLS] [SEP]  we may retain access logs containing this data for up to 120 days, and then delete them. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. [CLS] [SEP] however, if you reject new cookies, portions of open humans will not function as intended. [CLS] [SEP] when you log in to your account, open humans will place a cookie for the purposes of creating the session, knowing when you’re logged in, and validating form submissions. [CLS] [SEP] the cookie contains an encrypted user identifier. [CLS] [SEP] if we are going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] § 2705(b)). [CLS] [SEP] we may also share aggregate information with others – for instance, with our funders, to help them understand our community and how it uses our service. [CLS] [SEP] sharing data is critical to scientific progress, but has been hampered by traditional research practices. [CLS] [SEP] our approach is to invite willing participants to share their personal data for the greater good. [CLS] [SEP] open humans strives to make this possible by helping connect researchers and participants who wish to share data with each other. [CLS] [SEP]   if open humans or the open humans foundation is involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to another entity as part of that deal. [CLS] [SEP] if that happens, we will notify you and let you know what your options are. [CLS] [SEP] an account must represent an individual . [CLS] [SEP]
