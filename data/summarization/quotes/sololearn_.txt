We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. [CLS] [SEP] We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on the https://www.sololearn.com/ site, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means. [CLS] [SEP] If you donâ€™t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. [CLS] [SEP]  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. [CLS] [SEP]
