" that is a good question and it gets to a misconception about open source .  generally speaking, secrecy does not make code secure .  if there is a vulnerability hidden in code, it will eventually be found .  good developers scrupulously following security guidelines and putting out regular updates is what keeps code secure .  by making our code open source (and by running a bug bounty program) we have enabled and incentivized our community to help us discover any possible vulnerabilities .  so, in actuality, being open source helps us stay secure .  hope this answers your question! reply * * * william * *, [august 22 , 2020 at 8 : 50 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 22331) i use proton mail .  when i click on the shortcut to go to mail i see my username and password on the log in all ready to go .  i want to change it so that i have to type in my user name and password each time i access proton mail .  on all of my computers this happens .  i do not want this happening so please advise .  bill reply * * * roxana zega * *, [september 2 , 2020 at 5 : 20 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 22405) hi william, please check your browser settings - it might have saved your login credentials .  thanks .
