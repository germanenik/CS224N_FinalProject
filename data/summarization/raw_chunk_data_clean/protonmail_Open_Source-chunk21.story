for example, spammers could use the code to figure out how to bypass our anti - spam protection measures .  reply * * * anonymous * *, [october 22 , 2016 at 6 : 11 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 12723) " we also cannot really open source the backend because it would expose details that could have security consequences " another line .  any security that relies on secrecy of the algorithm is bound to fail, someone will reverse engineer it, find a weakness, create an exploit etc .  i don' t think people will care if you keep your spam filters proprietary, what people are interested in vetting is the crypto .  if you are using industry standard methods there is no reason' security' would be compromised by exposing the code, only the keys must be kept private .  please recognise that folks asking for the code to be open sourced have a good understanding of what this means .  avoidance of the true issues actually brings doubt on the integrity of the system you are trying to protect .  your previous statement claiming there is no benefit in public auditing of the system is either a deliberate falsehood or demonstrates poor understanding of how security works .  * * * admin * *, [october 25 , 2016 at 11 : 27 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 12739) for anti - spam purposes, security through obscurity actually works pretty well .  * * * anonymous * *, [february 28 , 2017 at 10 : 00 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 13585) if anti - spam is the only issue, maybe your anti - spam code could be externalize in a separate library, in which case you could open source the rest of the backend? * * * thisi s .
