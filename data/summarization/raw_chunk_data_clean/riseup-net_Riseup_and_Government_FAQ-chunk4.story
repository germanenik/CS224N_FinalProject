for example, if obama had a secret email address with riseup and applied for the address using [president @ whitehouse . gov] (mailto: president @ whitehouse . gov) as his alternate email address, it would be a good idea for him to remove [president @ whitehouse . gov] (mailto: president @ whitehouse . gov) from his alternate email if he wanted to be able to engage in constitutionally - protected, anonymous, speech .  but please note: if you do remove your alternate email, and you later lose / forget your password, it will _ not be possible _ for us to reset your password .  you will be permanently locked out of your account and will not be able to access your emails .  you have been warned! * * email: * * if you are not already, consider using an email client that lets you download email via the pop protocol and deletes it from the server .  there is no getting around the mail arriving on riseup' s server, but if you download it and it' s deleted from the server then riseup doesn' t have it anymore .  but note this does have a downside, using webmail or the imap protocol does allow you to check email from more than one computer .  if you need that ability, one approach might be to move older email offline to a single computer and just check newer things from multiple locations .  here are some directions for [downloading your email] (/ en / email / clients / downloading - email).  * * lists: * * one of the nice features of having a mailing list is having a message archive .  but if the idea of someone you don' t want getting access to that archive scares you, then it might be better to do without an archive or periodically move the archive to a more secure location .  but don' t forget that any subscriber to your list gets a copy of every message, so even if you have the archives removed, there is nothing that prevents subscribers from leaking those messages! more info at: [downloading list archives] (/ en / lists / list - admin / maintenance / archives).  * * ask yourself: * * where are the important emails, documents, and manifestos of your group stored? do you have a good place for them for people to find when you are gone and people want to write the history about how you changed the world? if they are only stored in riseup, that isnat good .
