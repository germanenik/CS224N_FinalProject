as you decide whether to agree to this arbitration agreement, here are some important considerations: * arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury .  instead, the partiesa dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties under the jams streamlined arbitration rules & procedures .  arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you as an individual may bring against tinder .  agreeing to arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought and how they will be resolved .  * arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always the case .  the arbitrator will typically determine whether tinder or you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with tinder, based on the circumstances presented .  * important: there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against tinder alleging class and / or representative claims on your behalf including but not limited to class actions described in this section 15, which if successful, could potentially result in some monetary or other recovery to you, if you elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this arbitration agreement .  the mere existence of such class and / or representative lawsuits, however, does not mean that such lawsuits will ultimately succeed, or, even if successful, that you would be entitled to any recovery .  * you will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action against tinder, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive application of this arbitration agreement, and you will also be precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought against tinder, in each case provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and class action waiver previously agreed to with tinder .  whether to agree to this arbitration agreement is an important decision .  it is your decision to make, and you should take care to conduct further research and to consult with others a including but not limited to an attorney a regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any other important business or life decision .  if for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be invalid, you will nevertheless still be bound by any prior valid arbitration agreement that you entered into with tinder .
