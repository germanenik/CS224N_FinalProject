we would not consent to the installation of any external hardware or software on our network and would end the organization rather than install any .  however, once our fiber connections leave our space, they could be monitored .  this is not new, and has been our assumption from the beginning .  when you send an email to someone with an email hosted elsewhere, we have no control over it once it leaves our servers .  also, the us still has _ better _ laws for internet providers than in many other countries, including many places in europe, where there are data retention laws requiring providers to keep logs .  the us has no such requirement and it has been our policy for years to not keep any logs .  ## #how is riseup different than lavabit and silent circle? these were commercial services whose primary mission was to provide paid private email .  riseup is different in that we are a non - profit whose goal is to support activists and keep them safe .  those companies were for - profit businesses, riseup is in it for social change! ## #what if someone (like law enforcement) takes riseupas servers? they have in the past! this usually happens when they want logs, we tell them that we don' t have any and then they come and take the machine because they don' t believe us and want to see for themselves .  however, all of our servers use full disk encryption, which means they cannot see or do anything with the data on the disks without the keys .  nevertheless, we do not keep ip identifying logs, and store as little data as possible on our users .  but this is not just riseup' s responsibility, each user is responsible for limiting the amount of data that riseup stores for them! ## #how can i limit the amount of data that riseup stores for me? there are several ways * * account info: * * when you applied for an account you provided a little information .  after you are approved we don' t need this information anymore and you can clean it up .  login to user . riseup . net and review the information that you have provided there and consider what information you have given us that identifies you .
