the smartest people in the room have picked them apart and their vulnerabilities have been fixed to the best possible degree, exactly because they are open source .  so as you say, you' re software is built upon that solid base, but how can you expect any user who values security and / or privacy to trust that you are capable of implementing this tool in a manner which does not circumvent the security of that base? reply * * * ryan long * *, [august 25 , 2015 at 7 : 38 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 9170) and, obviously, i meant " your software, " not " you' re software . " reply * * * admin * *, [august 26 , 2015 at 10 : 01 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 9192) because of spam issues, it is not secure to open source the backend code .  open sourcing the backend also does not increase trust because the software runs on our servers .  reply * * * [edoardo] (http: / / edoardoo . com) * *, [december 11 , 2015 at 11 : 22 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 10106) spamassassin is open source and still it' s an extremely powerful tool, for example .  open sourcing the back - end would permit other people to use this (awesome) service on private servers, which reasonably goes versus your business plan .  please don' t use the spam excuse .  * * * admin * *, [december 14 , 2015 at 3 : 01 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 10129) we don' t rely solely on spamassassin as that doesn' t work on internal emails which we can' t read .  * * * [face] (http: / / myutil . com) * *, [may 10 , 2017 at 10 : 52 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 14153) please consider moving all your spam filters into a proprietary module, and releasing the rest as open source .  allowing organizations and individuals to run protonmail on their own infrastructure would have tremendous value to the community .
