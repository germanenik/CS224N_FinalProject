in doing so, both you and tinder give up the right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and tinder (except for matters that may be properly taken to a small claims court and are within such courtas jurisdiction).  you also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding, including, without limitation, any past, pending or future class actions, including those existing as of the date of this agreement, which include without limitation: allan candelore v .  tinder, inc ., los angeles superior court, state of california, county of los angeles, case no .  bc583162 (generally claiming, on behalf of california citizens who subscribed to tinder plus when they were at least 30 years old that tinder violated the california unruh civil rights act by charging older subscribers a higher price than tinder charged subscribers younger than 30) and kim v .  tinder, inc ., united states district court, central district of california, case no .  2 : 18 - cv - 03093 generally claiming, on behalf of california citizens who subscribed to tinder plus when they were at least 30 years old that tinder violated the california unruh civil rights act by charging older subscribers a higher price than tinder charged subscribers younger than 30).  this list may not be exhaustive, and there may be other currently pending actions against tinder .  3 .  if you assert a claim against tinder outside of small claims court (and tinder does not request that the claim be moved to small claims court), your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute .  the same is true for tinder .  both you and tinder are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator .  the arbitrator can generally grant the relief that a court can, including the ability to hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive motion based upon the partiesa pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion based upon the partiesa pleadings along with the evidence submitted), but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings .  decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons .  for details on the arbitration process, see our [arbitration procedures] (/ arbitration).  4 .  the jurisdiction and venue provisions in sections 16 and 17 are incorporated and are applicable to this arbitration agreement .
