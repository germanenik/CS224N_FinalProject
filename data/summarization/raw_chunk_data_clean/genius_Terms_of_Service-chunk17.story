(" jams "), under the optional expedited arbitration procedures then in effect for jams, except as provided herein .  jams may be contacted at [www . jamsadr . com] (http: / / www . jamsadr . com).  the arbitration will be conducted in new york, new york, unless you and genius agree otherwise .  if you are using the service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any jams filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with jams rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses .  if you are using the service for non - commercial purposes: (i) jams may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from jams; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney' s fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process .  any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction .  nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing genius from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of genius' s proprietary interests .  * * class action / jury trial waiver: * * with respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding .  this waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person' s claims .
