myname * *, [september 23 , 2016 at 1 : 14 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 12462) since there is no assurance that our private phone numbers will not be leaked, and since you claim to require sms phone number as purely an anti - spam measure, why not institute an optional bitcoin escrow deposit (perhaps $5 - 10 deposit for 10 emails per hour) as a safeguard against spam? then we can have real privacy possibilities for nerds who know the difference between real privacy and " trust us, it' s private " .  truly private messaging is on the verge of replacing email, so why not grab some market share before you are rendered obsolete by decentralized apps? reply * * * admin * *, [october 1 , 2016 at 3 : 31 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 12569) phone verification is only requested for less than 10% of user signups .  all verification methods can be bypassed by upgrading to a paid account, and this is possible with bitcoin .  reply * * * jack * *, [october 2 , 2016 at 8 : 12 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 12580) look, i believe in privacy and it is in large part why i donated several hundred dollars in the beginning of protonmails campaign .  in return i was given an email address .  now i find out i cannot get a free version of protonmail for my android? i really do not wish to pay again … and i really adhor the idea of having to have a google account .  google is hugely responsible for selling information … and they are by far the worse offender when it comes to you asking them to remove things .  they care nothing of privacy because their revues revolves around selling the hell out of whatever they can convince people to buy .  hence cookies and tracking, refusal to remove things and so forth .  when is protonmail going to have a free version for android which does not involve having a google + account? some of us value out privacy hence no face book, no twitter and no google accounts .  what i do or do not do should never be anyone else' s business .
