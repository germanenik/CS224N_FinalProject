download them and put them somewhere safer! we are birds, so we like eggs, but we don' t like people putting all their eggs in our basket .  ## #will riseup services last forever? while we are committed to doing everything in our power to protect the data of social movements and activists, short of extended incarceration, we would rather pull the plug than submit to repressive surveillance by any government .  we would be really sad to see riseup go, but if we are forced to, we would rather it go away than to betray your trust and compromise the activist community .  with this in mind, you should be sure you are prepared in case something does happen, such as downloading and archive your email on your own computer! ## #what about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc .  would you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things? those things violate riseup' s terms of service and, unlike some more " american libertarian " service providers, we do not exist to provide privacy for doing anything you want .  we would close the accounts of people doing those things and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization, and your email .
