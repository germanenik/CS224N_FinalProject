how can i limit the amount of data that riseup stores for me? 6 .  will riseup services last forever? 7 .  what about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc .  would you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things? we have received your emails asking a number of good questions in light of last week' s news about [lavabit and silentcircle closing down] (https: / / www . theguardian . com / technology / 2013 / aug / 09 / lavabit - email - edward - snowden - shuts - down).  we would like to clearly state that riseup has never given any user information to any third party .  we have never permitted installation of any hardware or software monitoring on any system that we control .  we will do everything in our power to protect the data of social movements and activists, short of extended incarceration .  we would rather pull the plug than submit to repressive surveillance by our government, or any government .  we are doing everything we can, as quickly as possible, to forge forward with options that would prevent us from having to shut down, in case we are faced with making such a decision .  in cooperation with other groups, we are hard at work to develop and deploy a radical new infrastructure that would allow us to provide email in a way that is a thousand times more secure and that would prevent us from having access to any user' s data .  we have been working on this for over a year, but we have a lot more work to do before it is finalized .  don' t panic .  here are some questions and answers .  ## #is riseup working with the nsa? we would rather stop being riseup before we did that .  we are not working with any government agency .  we have never simply handed over information when requested, and for years have had a no logging policy .  we have fought and won every time anyone has tried to get us to give up information .  we have never turned over any user data to any third party, fourth party, fifth party or any party .  ## #but your servers are located in the u . s ., doesnat that mean you have to install backdoors / monitoring / etc? we have no control over our network providers, but we have physical control of our servers, they are not hosted " in the cloud . " this gives us much more physical assurance of the security of our machines .
