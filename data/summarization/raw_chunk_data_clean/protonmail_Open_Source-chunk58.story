but i find that protonmail also has a tor browser address .  my question is: can i send encrypted emails via that onion address and, if so, do i have to get a onion address for email and password? reply * * * richie koch * *, [november 11 , 2020 at 11 : 18 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 23335) hi bill, we do indeed have an onion site that you can access via tor .  however, nothing about protonmail or your account changes if you visit our onion site (which is <https: / / protonirockerxow . onion /> ).  you will be able to send and receive messages just as before and you will still log in with your normal protonmail account username and password .  you can read more here: <https: / / protonmail . com / blog / tor - encrypted - email />.  cheers reply * * * [jaynparr] (http: / / regarding% 20proton% 20mail) * *, [november 11 , 2020 at 7 : 35 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 23310) can this web - based email be used by usa common individuals or is it for corporations (companies) only? thank you! reply * * * richie koch * *, [november 11 , 2020 at 8 : 32 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 23311) protonmail can be used by anyone, individuals and corporations alike .
