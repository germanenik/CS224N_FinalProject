fast forward to the present date and now google is facing anti - trust charges for their questionable business ethics - - - - - and yet, hardly anyone else in silicon valley appears to have the guts to stand up to google to force a change for the better! please don' t tell me the makers of protonmail agree with googles draconian mindset?! please - - - - - tell me that protonmail is serious enough about protecting user privacy - - - - - even to the point of providing them with a non - google option … (i . e ., such as [appsapk . com] …) if protonmail were deliver on a non - google - play application, i will then consider an account because that is how important i realize the issue of user privacy and dignity really is - - - - - i only hope that protonmail has reached that same conclusion - - - - - for if we continue to let google and other corporate thugs have their way with us, the future of this world will be a lot more dismal than orson welles could' ve ever imagined … <https: / / www . schneier . com / essays / archives / 2006 / 05 / the _ eternal _ value _ of . html> reply * * * a concerned citizen * *, [may 8 , 2016 at 12 : 20 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 11970) amen, … as similar arguments hold for apple and microsoft, i would argue the [ubuntu phone] (http: / / www . ubuntu . com / phone) is the perfect way out, for any one trying to escape from getting encapsulated in the apple / google / microsoft / facebook empires .  while large companies are trying to force intrusive cloud services down our throats ([ windows 10] (http: / / www . theverge . com / 2016 / 1 / 16 / 10780876 / microsoft - windows - support - policy - new - processors - skylake) anyone? adobe creative cloud? or the whole apple / google infrastructure for all that matter?), trying to make us depend on their services and raping us privacy - wise, protonmail could make a stand by teaming up with canonical and provide decent / paid / secure / private cloud services for the ubuntu platform, both desktop and mobile .
