there are three primary types of cookies: * _ session cookies _ are specific to a particular visit and carry information as you view different pages so you don ’ t have to re - enter information every time you change pages or attempt to checkout .  session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of time like after you leave the site or when you close your web browser .  * _ persistent cookies _ remember certain information about your preferences for viewing the site, and allow etsy to recognize you each time you return .  persistent cookies are stored on your browser cache or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration .  * _ third - party cookies _ are placed by someone other than etsy, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and across multiple sessions .  they are usually a type of persistent cookie and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third - party cookie .  cookies store data about your use, but they are helpful because they allow us to help etsy function and customize your experience .  you can configure your desktop or mobile browser' s settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies, including how to handle third - party cookies (see managing your cookie technology preferences below).  a description of etsy ’ s principal first party cookies can be found in our [cookies & similar technologies disclosures] (https: / / www . etsy . com / legal / cookies - disclosures).  ## #other technologies in addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies used by etsy and elsewhere on the web or in mobile ecosystems .  * _ web beacons: _ these are tiny graphics (sometimes called “ clear gifs ” or “ web pixels ”) with a unique identifier that are used to understand browsing activity .  in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user' s computer hard drive, web beacons are rendered invisibly on web pages when you open a page .  * _ social widgets: _ these are buttons or icons provided by third - party social media providers that allow you to interact with those social media services when you view a web page or a mobile app screen .  these social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by the third parties .
