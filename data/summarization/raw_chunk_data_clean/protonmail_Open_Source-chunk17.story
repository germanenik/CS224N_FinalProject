reply * * * an * *, [january 17 , 2016 at 5 : 50 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 10485) good reply * * * tj * *, [january 25 , 2016 at 8 : 07 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 10754) i really love the simple and clean interface of protonmail .  this is the way email should be .  i also appreciate the added benefits of the security protonmail provides .  to know that our private communications are truly being protected and fully encrypted is the peace of mind i expect in an email provider .  the fact that we are not served ad' s inside nor outside of our inboxes is also commendable and again just proves that protonmail really does take user privacy seriously .  while i cannot make a donation today, i firmly intend to the next chance i get .  i hope the developers of protonmail continue to maintain this fine service long into the future - - - - - and please, please - - - - - don' t ever become like the trashy and privacy obfuscating services being offered by google, facebook and the like .  their defiant and utterly repulsive but forceful attitude with regard to how they treat user privacy is absolutely deplorable and should be rightfully boycotted where ever possible! thank you developers of protonmail .
