obviously, i could use the google play store to acquire it however, i have already had my annual colonoscopy and frankly, i question googles medical credentials and their true intent for having an unhealthy desire to be so far up and in my ass when honestly, i only had that one visit a couple years back .  i simply prefer not to engage or even make eye contact with them now, if that' s even possible these days .  is their an alternative location i might be able to acquire this apk and also be able to validate the integrity of it?? that sure would be swell, if a place like that existed and made it possible for privacy victims like me .  if not, i will somehow manage although, i just cannot see myself ever visiting the " play store " again especially, after experiencing the repetitive unwelcoming advances into my personal space and the overly aggressive behavior just a quick visit to that store can bring a person .  it' s totally traumatizing and borderline criminal .  nonetheless, any advice or even simple shove in a direction that can provide this request is most appreciated .  much thanks and oh, you guys rock!! respectfully, someone reply * * * mia n * *, [august 8 , 2019 at 1 : 13 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 18497) hi! you can find the apk here: <https: / / protonapps . com /> reply * * * ed barton * *, [august 14 , 2019 at 2 : 42 pm] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 18529) i ’ m not sure i correctly installed free encrypted email .  not sure if i did it correctly as i immediately saw $costs and choices after i started the installation .  can you tell me? i didn ’ t intend to purchase a subscription for super expensive secure email since i ’ m only a private, not a commercial account .  reply * * * ben wolford * *, [august 19 , 2019 at 10 : 21 am] (https: / / protonmail . com / blog / protonmail - open - source / #comment - 18559) hi ed, if you log in to your account at mail . protonmail . com and go to settings -> dashboard, you' ll be able to see whether you' re on the free plan or not .
