# protonmail is open source!

posted on [august 13, 2015november 29,

![](https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-

earlier today, [we released protonmail 2.0 to the
world](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-secure-email-open-source/). [CLS] [SEP] we
are happy to announce that we are also releasing protonmail 2.0 as open source
software! from the beginning, we have been strong proponents of open source
software and the core cryptography libraries that we develop and use have been
[open source from day one](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-open-source-
crytography/). [CLS] [SEP]

today, we are happy to take the next step and completely open source our
webmail interface. [CLS] [SEP] this means all the protonmail code that runs on your
computer is now available for inspection. [CLS] [SEP] we hope that by opening up our
platform, we will encourage additional contributors to help us make protonmail
[the world's most secure email
service](http://www.forbes.com/sites/hollieslade/2014/05/19/the-only-email-
system-the-nsa-cant-access/). [CLS] [SEP]

our move to open source has actually been coming for a long time. [CLS] [SEP] while it
would have also been possible to open source protonmail 1.x, we felt that such
a move was not appropriate given that the code was intended to be deprecated. [CLS] [SEP]
by open sourcing protonmail 2.0, we are open sourcing the future of
protonmail. [CLS] [SEP] as we continue to expand our private email service with mobile
apps, you can look forward to more open source announcements as our code base
matures. [CLS] [SEP]

protonmail 2.0 can be viewed online on github at the link below. [CLS] [SEP] as a nod to
our cern and mit roots, we are releasing under the permissive mit license. [CLS] [SEP] let
us know if you do something cool with our code. [CLS] [SEP]

    
    
    <https://github.com/protonmail/webclient>

we welcome all feedback at security@protonmail.ch and look forward to
continuing to improve protonmail with your help!

best regards,

i'm so enjoying this simple system that my hope is to close my sole other
email account. [CLS] [SEP]

but: does anyone know why my gmail account alerted me with a mailer daemon
when my protonmail account didn't accept a mssg with a (clean) attachment?
this happened minutes ago, and i don't like it. [CLS] [SEP] the accounts certainly are not
synced. [CLS] [SEP]

the accounts share only an address username, and possibly my laptop has
allowed an unwanted i.d. [CLS] [SEP] "save," somewhere - i dunno. [CLS] [SEP]

any light appreciated!

if i understood correctly, the open-source part in about the front-end part of
protonmail as you wrote in the "protonmail open source cryptography" post. [CLS] [SEP]
thank you very much for this release and for sure it will help to make
protonmail more secure. [CLS] [SEP] however, what about the code of the back-end part. [CLS] [SEP] it
could be really good to have it also under free license in order to host
protonmail at home on our own computer. [CLS] [SEP] i guess the arguments you defend on
the previous post for the front-end part are also valid for the back-end part. [CLS] [SEP]

reply

    * **admin** , [august 17, 2015 at 6:59 pm](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-open-source/#comment-8926)

the security risks of open sourcing the back-end code is too high. [CLS] [SEP] it would
let an attacker know how our infrastructure is set up or let spammers get
insight into how to circumvent our anti-spam measures. [CLS] [SEP]

reply

      * **anonymous** , [august 21, 2015 at 11:50 am](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-open-source/#comment-9101)

this approach to security ignores the fact that it's easier to find security
issues than it is to close them. [CLS] [SEP] an attacker being 'blind' by not having the
source code can still find flaws and when they do it's down to your team to
fix them. [CLS] [SEP] if other developers can see the code they might not spot them before
attackers do but they can certainly aid in providing fixes. [CLS] [SEP]

this "security through obscurity" mentality is widely understood to be wrong. [CLS] [SEP]
it's the reason we all prefer to use (and you brag about) using open source
crypto libraries. [CLS] [SEP] they are widely reviewed. [CLS] [SEP] the smartest people in the room
have picked them apart and their vulnerabilities have been fixed to the best
possible degree, exactly because they are open source. [CLS] [SEP] so as you say, you're
software is built upon that solid base, but how can you expect any user who
values security and/or privacy to trust that you are capable of implementing
this tool in a manner which does not circumvent the security of that base?

because of spam issues, it is not secure to open source the backend code. [CLS] [SEP] open
sourcing the backend also does not increase trust because the software runs on
our servers. [CLS] [SEP]

spamassassin is open source and still it's an extremely powerful tool, for
example. [CLS] [SEP] open sourcing the back-end would permit other people to use this
(awesome) service on private servers, which reasonably goes versus your
business plan. [CLS] [SEP] please don't use the spam excuse. [CLS] [SEP]

please consider moving all your spam filters into a proprietary module, and
releasing the rest as open source. [CLS] [SEP]

allowing organizations and individuals to run protonmail on their own
infrastructure would have tremendous value to the community. [CLS] [SEP] i know of several
non profits, and a government which would switch their infrastructure from
roundcube/dovecot/postfix to protonmail if they could self host. [CLS] [SEP] (though i
would guess postfix would still be used 😉

if it's not open source, you should assume that governments and commercial
interests have access to your information and act accordingly. [CLS] [SEP] words are wind. [CLS] [SEP]
the only way to know for sure is if we can verify the source. [CLS] [SEP]

i have had a serious issue with a cyberstalking hacker since about the time
this reply of yours was created possibly earlier so i’ve had multiple users
controlling all of my devices ( over 300 devices in just 10 months ) spent
life savings over $100k trying to resolve the issues just to find out my
phones were captive.apple.com and call diverted using a customizable call
center to apprehend my private confidential info also i froze my accounts with
equifax just to find out a few weeks later they were hacked with same exact
software it lists in my sony blu ray players which have been remotely
controlled for over a year and unusable by me apache 2.0 python st too much to
list i don’t even know anything about them but i wouldn’t be surprised if
proton mail is breached after my visit today to you i apologize in advance as
i have no say in the matter thanks for your understanding… the less fortunate

i think it is equally important for protonmail to understand the right of one
to protect their own privacy even from the prying eyes of google and its many
intrusive services. [CLS] [SEP] for that reason alone, i've long ago deleted my gmail
account and no longer wish to be tied down by such privacy-violating corporate
thugs. [CLS] [SEP]

in line with that thought, i do hope that any android application development
also includes a non-google play app option. [CLS] [SEP] i have more than ample reason for
not using any of google services and are rightfully concerned about how my
privacy is violated, even when using the google play store. [CLS] [SEP] this is why i
choose not to use google play at all. [CLS] [SEP] never mind the  
fact that in order to access apps through google play, google itself forces
users to have a gmail account-----this is outright blackmail and i find it
deplorable that very few companies desire to take a firm stand against this
borderline monopolizing by google. [CLS] [SEP]

lets face facts shall we…

google has already been implicated in dozens of privacy violations in just the
past ten years alone. [CLS] [SEP] fast forward to the present date and now google is
facing anti-trust charges for their questionable business ethics-----and yet,
hardly anyone else in silicon valley appears to have the guts to stand up to
google to force a change for the better!

please don't tell me the makers of protonmail agree with googles draconian
mindset?!

please-----tell me that protonmail is serious enough about protecting user
privacy-----even to the point of providing them with a non-google
option…(i.e., such as [ appsapk.com ]…)

if protonmail were deliver on a non-google-play application, i will then
consider an account because that is how important i realize the issue of user
privacy and dignity really is-----i only hope that protonmail has reached that
same conclusion-----for if we continue to let google and other corporate thugs
have their way with us, the future of this world will be a lot more dismal
than orson welles could've ever imagined…

amen,

…as similar arguments hold for apple and microsoft, i would argue the [ubuntu
phone](http://www.ubuntu.com/phone) is the perfect way out, for any one trying
to escape from getting encapsulated in the apple/google/microsoft/facebook
empires. [CLS] [SEP]

while large companies are trying to force intrusive cloud services down our
throats ([windows 10](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/16/10780876/microsoft-
windows-support-policy-new-processors-skylake) anyone? adobe creative cloud?
or the whole apple/google infrastructure for all that matter?), trying to make
us depend on their services and raping us privacy-wise, protonmail could make
a stand by teaming up with canonical and provide decent/paid/secure/private
cloud services for the ubuntu platform, both desktop and mobile. [CLS] [SEP]

one service that seems to go in this direction is
[telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telegram_%28software%29#client_applications),
a very nice alternative to whatsapp, now that facebook acquired that one
(gosh, i wonder how they are going to make that us$19 billion back? what could
be so precious, given that the service is for "free"??). [CLS] [SEP]

ahem, let me finish by stating that it's wonderful to have a service like
protonmail, be it by means of an app or a web interface. [CLS] [SEP] it really made my day
when i discovered there's a perfectly decent alternative to gmail. [CLS] [SEP] 🙂 <3

just out of curiosity for those of us whom are considering a donation to
protonmail, in order to obtain immediate access to a new email account-----
does protonmail accept donations on the premise that a users payment
information is retained and subsequently charged at a later date for any
reason?-----if so, does that mean that protonmail intends to create paid-for
email account access as opposed to free email account access?

if the donation is made only as a one-time donation, and furthermore, email
subscribers are not expected to pay for account access after that, then why is
payment information kept? for what purpose does that serve other than to raise
suspicion of intent on the part of protonmail?

any respondents to these questions should please take them as seriously as i
do for these are not unreasonable questions to ask and potential account
holders have the right to know this information…. [CLS] [SEP]

is not using open source software in direct conflict with secure protected
email service? your giving people like me (programmers) huge in-roads to
hacking / leveraging known flaws?

i was considering also starting an email service to provide a non-nsa letter

i really love the simple and clean interface of protonmail. [CLS] [SEP] this is the way
email should be. [CLS] [SEP] i also appreciate the added benefits of the security
protonmail provides. [CLS] [SEP] to know that our private communications are truly being
protected and fully encrypted is the peace of mind i expect in an email
provider. [CLS] [SEP]

the fact that we are not served ad's inside nor outside of our inboxes is also
commendable and again just proves that protonmail really does take user
privacy seriously. [CLS] [SEP]

while i cannot make a donation today, i firmly intend to the next chance i
get. [CLS] [SEP] i hope the developers of protonmail continue to maintain this fine
service long into the future-----and please, please-----don't ever become like
the trashy and privacy obfuscating services being offered by google, facebook
and the like. [CLS] [SEP] their defiant and utterly repulsive but forceful attitude with
regard to how they treat user privacy is absolutely deplorable and should be
rightfully boycotted where ever possible!

thank you developers of protonmail. [CLS] [SEP] you rock!

server side software runs in the backend and cannot be independently verified

"cannot be independently verified either way so there is no trust benefit to
open sourcing it"

this is a false sentiment. [CLS] [SEP] any software can be verified that it is handling
data correctly, has no bugs that might inadvertently expose data. [CLS] [SEP]

open sourcing the front end is akin to allowing us to verify that the padlock
is secure, while we have to trust that you have built the safe correctly. [CLS] [SEP]

i'm not saying i don't trust what you are doing, i think its great. [CLS] [SEP] but don't

"we also cannot really open source the backend because it would expose details

another line. [CLS] [SEP]

any security that relies on secrecy of the algorithm is bound to fail, someone
will reverse engineer it, find a weakness, create an exploit etc. [CLS] [SEP] i don't
think people will care if you keep your spam filters proprietary, what people
are interested in vetting is the crypto. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using industry standard
methods there is no reason 'security' would be compromised by exposing the
code, only the keys must be kept private. [CLS] [SEP]

please recognise that folks asking for the code to be open sourced have a good
understanding of what this means. [CLS] [SEP] avoidance of the true issues actually brings
doubt on the integrity of the system you are trying to protect. [CLS] [SEP] your previous
statement claiming there is no benefit in public auditing of the system is
either a deliberate falsehood or demonstrates poor understanding of how
security works. [CLS] [SEP]

if anti-spam is the only issue, maybe your anti-spam code could be externalize
in a separate library, in which case you could open source the rest of the
backend?

since there is no assurance that our private phone numbers will not be leaked,
and since you claim to require sms phone number as purely an anti-spam
measure, why not institute an optional bitcoin escrow deposit (perhaps $5-10
deposit for 10 emails per hour) as a safeguard against spam? then we can have
real privacy possibilities for nerds who know the difference between real
privacy and "trust us, it's private". [CLS] [SEP] truly private messaging is on the verge
of replacing email, so why not grab some market share before you are rendered

could you please advise why my plus (upgrade) is not capturing and putting
spam emails in 'spam"?

when i was a basic member, proton was placing at least 93% of spam in the spam
folder so i could quickly  
browse and immediately delete. [CLS] [SEP] since i have upgraded to plus…that 93% of spam
emails are in my inbox. [CLS] [SEP]  
it's a bit disarming, that i may accidentaly open one of these purposeful spam

why this is happening and how to rectify?

hi! the only way you would not be able to decrypt your emails is if you forgot
your password and reset it. [CLS] [SEP] this will reset your encryption keys, hence would
not allow you to decrypt old emails. [CLS] [SEP] please open a support ticket here:
protonmail.com/support-form and we will try to help you solve this asap. [CLS] [SEP]

dear protonmail-team and/or developer,

very big thx for your hard work, to make/build this mail-server with these
securelevel. [CLS] [SEP]  
i've been sure, my email-adress where deleted. [CLS] [SEP] but it wasn't. [CLS] [SEP]  
also a big thank-you/your all from the protonmail-team for this professional
artwork from your side. [CLS] [SEP]

and i think i've got to say sorry for my unworking (time without learning
developer-skillz) time, since i started visiting the overview side of the
worldwideweb. [CLS] [SEP] i have too work now harder & faster, too leave the status "baby-
dog security". [CLS] [SEP]

but it is never too late, starting learning, too be a constructional part of
the www. [CLS] [SEP]

let the life of the protonmail-developer never starts the roadend. [CLS] [SEP] but i
believe, this is still working, since protonmail was writen from the
protonmailteam

best wishes from my side too the protonmailerteam and i hope, i never have too
leave your incredible server. [CLS] [SEP]

with deep attentional respect for your work,  
patrick paul kokott from germany

hello,

forgive me if it is mentioned below as i only briefly reviewed the posts
although, i am having a real challenge trying to locate a reliable and
trustworthy apk for protonmail. [CLS] [SEP]

obviously, i could use the google play store to acquire it however, i have
already had my annual colonoscopy and frankly, i question googles medical
credentials and their true intent for having an unhealthy desire to be so far
up and in my ass when honestly, i only had that one visit a couple years back. [CLS] [SEP]
i simply prefer not to engage or even make eye contact with them now, if
that's even possible these days. [CLS] [SEP]

is their an alternative location i might be able to acquire this apk and also
be able to validate the integrity of it?? that sure would be swell, if a place
like that existed and made it possible for privacy victims like me. [CLS] [SEP]

if not, i will somehow manage although, i just cannot see myself ever visiting
the "play store" again especially, after experiencing the repetitive
unwelcoming advances into my personal space and the overly aggressive behavior
just a quick visit to that store can bring a person. [CLS] [SEP]

it's totally traumatizing and borderline criminal. [CLS] [SEP]

nonetheless, any advice or even simple shove in a direction that can provide
this request is most appreciated. [CLS] [SEP]

much thanks and oh, you guys rock!!

good question. [CLS] [SEP] we have an article here about [what is

the short answer to your question is that your data is always encrypted on the

google will be able to read the message. [CLS] [SEP] same with messages from gmail to
protonmail: google can read it, but we cannot. [CLS] [SEP] email addresses are not

i think your question is "because the code is publicly known, won't it be
easier to take advantage of?"  
that is a good question and it gets to a misconception about open source. [CLS] [SEP]
generally speaking, secrecy does not make code secure. [CLS] [SEP] if there is a
vulnerability hidden in code, it will eventually be found. [CLS] [SEP] good developers
scrupulously following security guidelines and putting out regular updates is
what keeps code secure. [CLS] [SEP] by making our code open source (and by running a bug
bounty program) we have enabled and incentivized our community to help us
discover any possible vulnerabilities. [CLS] [SEP] so, in actuality, being open source
helps us stay secure. [CLS] [SEP]  
hope this answers your question!

i'm fairly new to protonmail. [CLS] [SEP] but i find that protonmail also has a tor
browser address. [CLS] [SEP] my question is: can i send encrypted emails via that onion
address and, if so, do i have to get a onion address for email and password?

hi bill,  
we do indeed have an onion site that you can access via tor. [CLS] [SEP] however, nothing
about protonmail or your account changes if you visit our onion site (which is
<https://protonirockerxow.onion/>). [CLS] [SEP] you will be able to send and receive
messages just as before and you will still log in with your normal protonmail
account username and password. [CLS] [SEP] you can read more here:

please add a link to your github site in the footer of this website. [CLS] [SEP]  
the source code will be easier to be found for developers - and for all of us
that try very hard to protect our personal data, it is the only way to get the
app on our android device. [CLS] [SEP]

and you should clarify that using a database from google doesn't have any
impact on our security and privacy. [CLS] [SEP]  
k9-mail also tells me when i receive mails on my "not so secure" mail account. [CLS] [SEP]
it just checks after a given time. [CLS] [SEP] no need for any part of google. [CLS] [SEP]

is that privacy concern the main reason why proton mail isn't to be found on
f-droid? i mean, you pray privacy and then a normal user needs to have a
googled (or "appled" but that part can't be changed because apple is
completely against open source) phone to get the app?!

but i don't understand why protonvpn is found on f-droid. [CLS] [SEP] of course this also
gives a warning about proprietary network services…

so please make it easier to get the app for all those who can't or won't use
google services. [CLS] [SEP]

for now, tutanota does a better job of protecting the privacy of their users
-.-

hi dp the protonvpn appp is [available on
f-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.protonvpn.android/). [CLS] [SEP] releasing
protonmail on f-droid requires significantly more development resources
because of f-droid requirements. [CLS] [SEP] we would like to do this, but we don’t

hi mbuyiseli. [CLS] [SEP] protonmail runs a highly secure zero-knowledge mail service, but
there is no such thing as 100% security. [CLS] [SEP] any company that claims otherwise is
not being fully honest. [CLS] [SEP] that said, if you connect to protonmail via vpn or
tor, and send a message that way, your anonymity will be preserved. [CLS] [SEP] protonmail
is often used by whistleblowers for this reason. [CLS] [SEP]
