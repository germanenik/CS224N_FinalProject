##  how to i enable or disable two-factor authentication (2fa)?  

two-factor authentication is a recommended security feature that can help
protect your sync account from unauthorized access. [CLS] [SEP] enabling two-factor
authentication means that the sync apps and web panel will require an
additional security code (along with your password ) when you sign in to your
account or add a new computer or device. [CLS] [SEP]

you can enable two-factor authentication using a mobile authenticator app
(such as google authenticator) or using email delivery. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

**to enable or disable 2fa using email delivery (easiest):**

  1. [CLS] [SEP] [sign in to the web panel](https://cp.sync.com/account/security). [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] click your **email address** (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] select **settings.**
  4. [CLS] [SEP] click the **security** tab. [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] click **edit** beside two-factor authentication. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] click **enable 2-fa via email** (or **disable** to disable 2fa if you previously enabled it). [CLS] [SEP]
  7. [CLS] [SEP] be sure to download the **backup codes** and store them in a safe place. [CLS] [SEP] you can use each backup code once, in the event that you need to sign in and do not have access to your email. [CLS] [SEP] 

2fa is now enabled. [CLS] [SEP] you will have to check your email address for the
additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel or install
sync on a new computer or device. [CLS] [SEP]

* * *

**to enable 2fa using a mobile authenticator app (such as google
authenticator):**

before you begin you will need to download and install the google
authenticator app on your phone or tablet. [CLS] [SEP] get it on the [apple app
store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)
or [google play
store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.auth). [CLS] [SEP]

  1. [CLS] [SEP] [sign in to the web panel](https://cp.sync.com/account/security). [CLS] [SEP]
  2. [CLS] [SEP] click your **email address** (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar. [CLS] [SEP]
  3. [CLS] [SEP] select **settings.**
  4. [CLS] [SEP] click the **security** tab. [CLS] [SEP]
  5. [CLS] [SEP] click **edit** beside two-factor authentication. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP] click **enable 2-fa via google authenticator**. [CLS] [SEP] note: if 2fa is currently set to email, click **disable** and then click **edit** again to enable 2-fa via google authenticator. [CLS] [SEP]
  7. [CLS] [SEP] open the google authenticator app on your mobile device and tap **scan a barcode**. [CLS] [SEP] you may have to tap **+** first, if you've already setup the app with other services. [CLS] [SEP] 
  8. [CLS] [SEP] scan the qr code displayed on the sync web panel, into the google authenticator app. [CLS] [SEP]
  9. [CLS] [SEP] the google authenticator app will provide a 6-digit verification code. [CLS] [SEP] **enter the verification code** on the sync web panel and click **save**. [CLS] [SEP]
  10. [CLS] [SEP] be sure to download the **backup codes** and store them in a safe place. [CLS] [SEP] you can use each backup code once, in the event that you do not have access to your mobile device. [CLS] [SEP]

2fa is now enabled. [CLS] [SEP] you will have to check the google authenticator app for
the additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel or
install sync on a new computer or device. [CLS] [SEP]

computer. [CLS] [SEP]

once you've installed the sync desktop app you can click the **sync icon** on
the windows system tray or the mac menu bar and select the **go to sync.com

each time you access the web panel from the desktop app go to sync.com web
