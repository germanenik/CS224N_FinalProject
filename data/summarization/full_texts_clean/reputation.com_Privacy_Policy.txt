    1. [CLS] [SEP] session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave a website (i.e. [CLS] [SEP] “close the session”). [CLS] [SEP] we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the site, specifically to track your session id and to track whether or not you are logged into the site.

specific users, adapted to their interests. [CLS] [SEP] they can be used to track the

personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

  5. [CLS] [SEP]  **what categories of cookies do we use?**  

    1. [CLS] [SEP] we use essential cookies. [CLS] [SEP]

[CLS] [SEP] the statistical cookies we use are listed [here](https://reputation.com/cookie-and-tracking-technology-page/). [CLS] [SEP]
    4. [CLS] [SEP] we use marketing cookies. [CLS] [SEP] we use cookies to market/advertise our services – and only our services — to you. [CLS] [SEP] we, or our service providers and other third parties we work with, place cookies when you visit our site and other websites or when you open emails that we send you, in order to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective. [CLS] [SEP] for instance, we evaluate which ads are clicked on most often, and whether those clicks lead users to make better use of our tools, features and services. [CLS] [SEP] we partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites our third-party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. [CLS] [SEP] if you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or if located in the european union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). [CLS] [SEP] the marketing cookies we use are listed [here](https://reputation.com/cookie-and-tracking-technology-page/). [CLS] [SEP]  

      1. [CLS] [SEP] we partner with a third party advertising technology provider (hubspot, marketo and demandbase) to track information on your browsing history as you surf our site and then serve targeted display ads to you on other websites. [CLS] [SEP] you can learn more [here](https://www.nextroll.com/privacy). [CLS] [SEP] to opt out of receiving any advertising from these providers, please opt out [here](https://app.adroll.com/optout/safari) or email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a0a08130c1b19033a081f0a0f0e1b0e13151454191517) please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

    5. [CLS] [SEP] we set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. [CLS] [SEP] persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the site. [CLS] [SEP]
  6. [CLS] [SEP]  **what similar technologies do we use?**  

    1. [CLS] [SEP] we employ and our third-party advertising partners (such as marketo or hubspot) employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a. [CLS] [SEP] web beacons/web bugs), that helps us better manage content on the site by informing us what content is effective. [CLS] [SEP] “clear gifs” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the site and our outbound emails. [CLS] [SEP] a “script” is a piece of program code that is used to make our website function properly and interactively. [CLS] [SEP] this code is executed on our server or on your device. [CLS] [SEP] a “web beacon” (or a pixel tag) is a small, invisible piece of text or image on a website that is used to monitor traffic on a website. [CLS] [SEP] in order to do this, various data about you is stored using web beacons. [CLS] [SEP]  
in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive,
clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence. [CLS] [SEP] we tie the information gathered by clear
gifs to our website visitors personal data. [CLS] [SEP] we use clear gifs in our html-
based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. [CLS] [SEP] this allows
us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
of our marketing campaigns. [CLS] [SEP]

  7. [CLS] [SEP]  **how can users manage cookies?**  

    1. [CLS] [SEP] managing cookies. [CLS] [SEP] most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies and to delete cookies by modifying your browser settings. [CLS] [SEP] the methods for doing so vary from browser to browser, and from version to version. [CLS] [SEP] on most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar, which should provide information on how to be notified when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. [CLS] [SEP] you can obtain up-to-date information about blocking and deleting cookies through the settings of the most popular browsers via the links below. [CLS] [SEP] if you reject cookies, you will still be able to view the site, but your ability to use some areas of the site, will be limited. [CLS] [SEP]
