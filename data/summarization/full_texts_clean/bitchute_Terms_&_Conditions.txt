number of months of active membership, are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP] however, if these

## termination

we may terminate your access to and use of the service at our sole discretion,
at any time and without notice to you. [CLS] [SEP] you may cancel your account at any time
from within the service. [CLS] [SEP] upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation
of the service or your account, the following provisions will survive:
feedback; content ownership, responsibility and removal; warranty disclaimers;
limitation of liability; general terms; severability; jurisdiction and this
sentence of termination. [CLS] [SEP]

## warranty disclaimers

the service and content are provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. [CLS] [SEP]
without limiting the foregoing, we explicitly disclaim any warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment or non-
infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of
trade. [CLS] [SEP] we make no warranty that the service will meet your requirements or be
available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. [CLS] [SEP] we make no
warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness,
completeness or reliability of any content. [CLS] [SEP]

## limitation of liability

neither bitchute nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or
delivering the service or content will be liable for any incidental, special,
exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or
goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost
of substitute services arising out of or in connection with these terms or
from the use of or inability to use the service or content, whether based on
warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any
other legal theory, and whether or not bitchute has been informed of the
possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found
to have failed of its essential purpose. [CLS] [SEP] some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
so the above limitation may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

in no event will bitchute's total liability arising out of or in connection
with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the service (or
content) exceed the amounts you have paid to bitchute for use of the service
(or content), or one hundred dollars ($100) if you have not had any payment
obligations to bitchute, as applicable. [CLS] [SEP] the exclusions and limitations of
damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain
between bitchute and you. [CLS] [SEP]

## general terms

these terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement and understanding
between bitchute and you regarding the service and content. [CLS] [SEP] these terms
supersede and replace any and all prior agreements or understanding (oral,
written or otherwise) between bitchute and you regarding the service or
content. [CLS] [SEP] if for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
provision of these terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these
terms will remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] you may not assign or transfer
these terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without bitchute's prior
written consent. [CLS] [SEP] any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms, without
such consent, will be null and void. [CLS] [SEP] bitchute may freely assign or transfer
these terms without restriction. [CLS] [SEP] subject to the foregoing, these terms will
bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted
assigns. [CLS] [SEP]

any notices or other communications provided by bitchute under these terms,
including those regarding modifications to these terms, will be given by
posting to the service. [CLS] [SEP] bitchute's failure to enforce any right or provision
of these terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] the
waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
signed by a duly authorised representative of bitchute. [CLS] [SEP] except as expressly
set forth in these terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies
under these terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
terms or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]

## severability

if any term, clause or provision of these terms is deemed to be unlawful, void
or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall be
deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions. [CLS] [SEP]

## jurisdiction

the terms, and your relationship with bitchute under the terms, shall be
governed by english law. [CLS] [SEP] you and bitchute agree to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of england to resolve any legal matter arising from
the terms. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding this, you agree that bitchute shall still be
allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types of urgent
legal remedy) in any jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]
