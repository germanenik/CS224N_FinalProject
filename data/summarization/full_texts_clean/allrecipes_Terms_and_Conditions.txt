### effective date: march 16, 2017

please read this terms and conditions agreement (" **agreement** ") carefully. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement is a legal contract between you (" **user** ") and meredith
corporation (" **meredith,** " " **company,** " " **we,** " or " **us** "). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **section 15 of this agreement is an arbitration clause that requires most
disputes between us to be resolved through binding and final arbitration
instead of in court. [CLS] [SEP] see section 15 for more information regarding this
arbitration clause, and how to opt out.**  
by accessing or using any website with an authorized link to this agreement ("
**website** "), registering an account or accessing or using any content,
information, services, features or resources available or enabled via the
website (collectively with the website, the " **services** "), clicking on a
button or taking another action to signify your acceptance of this agreement,
you: (1) agree to be bound by this agreement and any future amendments and
additions to this agreement as published through the services; (2) represent
you are of legal age in your jurisdiction of residence to form a binding
contract; and (3) represent that you have the authority to enter into this
agreement personally and, if applicable, on behalf of any company,
organization or other legal entity on whose behalf you use the services. [CLS] [SEP]
**except as otherwise provided herein, if you do not agree to be bound by this
agreement, you may not access or use the services.**  
  
your use of the services is also subject to any additional terms, conditions
and policies that we separately post on the services (" **supplemental terms**
") which are incorporated by reference into this agreement. [CLS] [SEP] some of the
specialized features and tools accessible through our services are provided by
third-party companies pursuant to their own separate terms of service ("
**third-party terms** ") that differ from ours. [CLS] [SEP]  by using such third-party
features and tools, you agree that your relationships with the third-party
service providers will be governed by the applicable [third-party
terms](/legal/terms-other). [CLS] [SEP]

subject to section 15.9 of this agreement, meredith reserves the right to
modify this agreement or its policies relating to the services at any time,
effective upon posting of an updated version of this agreement or any
applicable supplemental terms on the applicable services. [CLS] [SEP] you should regularly
review this agreement, as your continued use of the services after any such
changes constitutes your agreement to such changes. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **1\. [CLS] [SEP] registration.** when registering an account for the services ("
**account** "), you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete
information requested by the registration form (the " **registration data** ")
and to promptly update the registration data thereafter as necessary. [CLS] [SEP] you
represent that you are not barred from using the services under any applicable
law and that you will be responsible for all activities that occur under your
account. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to monitor your account to restrict its use by minors and
other unauthorized users and agree not to share your account or password with
anyone. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree to notify meredith immediately of any unauthorized
use of your password or any other breach of the security of your account and
to exit from your account at the end of each session. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to create
an account using a false identity or alias or if you previously have been
banned from using any of the services. [CLS] [SEP] you further agree that you will not
maintain more than one account for the same meredith service at any given
time. [CLS] [SEP] meredith reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any
time and for any reason. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge and agree that you have no ownership
or other property interest in your account and that all rights in and to your
account are owned by and inure to the benefit of meredith. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **2\. [CLS] [SEP] order process.**  
  
 **2.1 _order acceptance._** each part of any order that you submit to
meredith constitutes an offer to purchase. [CLS] [SEP] if you do not receive a message
from meredith confirming receipt of your order, please contact our customer
service department before re-entering your order. [CLS] [SEP] meredith's confirmation of
receipt of your order does not constitute meredith's acceptance of your order. [CLS] [SEP]
meredith is only deemed to have accepted your order once (i) the product(s)
you ordered (each, a " **product** ") have been shipped (if the product is a
one-time order) or (ii) the initial product for a subscription has been
delivered (if the product is subject to a subscription for the delivery of
periodicals or other tangible goods) or (iii) you are granted access to the
paid content or resources of a product consisting of a digital subscription or
membership). [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **2.2 _order issues._** although we strive to accept all valid orders,
meredith reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if:
(i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the product
or receive insufficient or erroneous billing, payment, and/or shipping
information, (ii) we suspect an order has been placed using stolen payment
card information or otherwise appears to be connected to fraud, or (iii) the
ordered product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] we may also
refuse any order that is connected with a previous payment dispute. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **2.3 _order cancellation._** if any product is discontinued or otherwise
becomes unavailable, meredith reserves the right to (i) cancel your order and
provide you a refund for the amount paid for the product (if the product is a
one-time order), (ii) substitute the product with a similar product (if the
product is subject to a subscription) or (iii) issue you a pro rata refund. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **2.4 _restrictions on resale._** to protect the intellectual property rights
of meredith and its licensors and suppliers, any resale of products for
personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. [CLS] [SEP] meredith reserves the
right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of
reselling. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **3\. [CLS] [SEP] fees and purchase terms.**

fees and charges due and payable to meredith hereunder, (ii) meredith is
authorized to share any payment information and instructions required to
complete the payment transactions with its third-party payment service
providers (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and
related services), and (iii) no additional notice or consent is required for
the foregoing authorizations. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to immediately notify meredith of any
change in your payment information. [CLS] [SEP] meredith reserves the right at any time to
change its prices and billing methods. [CLS] [SEP] if payment cannot be charged to your
payment card or your payment is returned for any reason, meredith reserves the
right to either suspend or terminate your access to the upaid-for services. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **3.2 _automatic renewal._** if your order is subject to automatic renewal,

cancellation terms provided during the order process are hereby incorporated
into this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **3.3 _refunds._** except as set forth in section 2.3 or in any separate
refund policy posted on the services, all fees are non-refundable. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **3.4 _discounts, promo codes and premium offers._** we may, in our sole
discretion, create discounts and promotional codes that may be redeemed for
credit in your account, or other features or benefits, subject to any
additional terms that we establish on a per promotional code basis (" **promo

promotional offers, inlcuding premium offers, may be discontinued at any time,
without prior notice, at our discretion and are only available while supplies
last or for the duration noted. [CLS] [SEP]  unless otherwise stated in the offer,
shipment of premium items may take 6-12 weeks and shipping fees may apply. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **4\. [CLS] [SEP] user content.**  
  
 **4.1 _responsible party for content._** you acknowledge that all content is
the sole responsibility of the party from whom such content originated. [CLS] [SEP] this
means that each user is entirely responsible for all content that that user

content** "). [CLS] [SEP] meredith has no obligation to pre-screen any content. [CLS] [SEP] you use
all user content and interact with other users at your own risk. [CLS] [SEP] without
limiting the foregoing, meredith reserves the right in its sole discretion to

your content that you submit to any "public" area of the services. [CLS] [SEP]

 **15.1 _applicability of arbitration agreement._** you agree that any dispute
between you and us relating in any way to the services, our advertising or
marketing practices, any products sold or distributed through the services, or
this agreement, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,

qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or meredith may
seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of
intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,
trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). [CLS] [SEP] **this arbitration agreement shall
apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before
the effective date of this agreement or any prior version of this agreement.**
****  
  
****if you agree to arbitration with meredith, you are agreeing in advance
that you will not participate in or seek to recover monetary or other relief
in any lawsuit filed against meredith alleging class, collective, and/or
representative claims on your behalf. [CLS] [SEP] instead, by agreeing to arbitration, you
may bring covered claims against meredith only in an individual arbitration
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other
relief by an arbitrator. [CLS] [SEP] you acknowledge that you have been advised that you
may consult with an attorney in deciding whether to accept this arbitration

the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] to begin an
arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
describing your claim to john zieser, general counsel, meredith corporation,
1716 locust street, des moines, ia 50309. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be conducted by
jams, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. [CLS] [SEP] disputes
involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under
$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to
jams' most current version of the streamlined arbitration rules and procedures
available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other
claims shall be subject to jams's most current version of the comprehensive
arbitration rules and procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-
comprehensive-arbitration/. [CLS] [SEP] jams's rules are also available at
www.jamsadr.comor by calling jams at 800-352-5267. [CLS] [SEP] if jams is not available to
arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. [CLS] [SEP] if the
arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay jams's filing, administrative,
hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from jams, meredith
will pay them for you. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, meredith will reimburse all such jams'
filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in
controversy totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the
claims are frivolous. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another
mutually agreed location. [CLS] [SEP] any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **15.3 _authority of arbitrator._** the arbitrator, and not any federal,
state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
formation of this arbitration agreement including, but not limited to any
claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. [CLS] [SEP]
the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
meredith. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other
matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall
have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or
dispute. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and
to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this agreement (including the
arbitration agreement). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall issue a written award and
statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the
calculation of any damages awarded. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator shall follow the applicable
law. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
basis that a judge in a court of law would have. [CLS] [SEP] the award of the arbitrator
is final and binding upon you and us. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **15.4 _waiver of jury trial._** you and meredith hereby waive any
constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court (other than small claims
court as permitted herein) and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. [CLS] [SEP] you
and meredith are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall
be resolved by arbitration under this arbitration agreement, except as
specified in section 15.1 above. [CLS] [SEP] an arbitrator can award on an individual
basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this agreement as
a court would. [CLS] [SEP] however, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **15.5 _waiver of class or consolidated actions._** all claims and disputes
within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an
individual basis and not on a class, collective or representative basis. [CLS] [SEP] only
individual relief is available for claims covered by this arbitration
agreement, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated
or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this section 15.5 is deemed
invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute,
neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute
and instead the applicable claim or dispute shall be resolved in a court as
set forth in section 16.5. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **15.6 _30-day right to opt out._** you have the right to opt out of the

out of this arbitration agreement. [CLS] [SEP] if you opt out of this arbitration
agreement, all other parts of this agreement will continue to apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

in the future with us. [CLS] [SEP]  
  
 **15.7 _severability._** subject to section 15.5, if any part or parts of

any notices required/ permitted by this agreement, meredith's dispatch of the
