# privacy policy

whatismyip.com® (the “website”) is a website owned by innovation hq, inc., a
corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of antigua, with a postal
address of p.o. [CLS] [SEP] box 990 lower factory road, st. [CLS] [SEP] johns, antigua (the
“provider”, “we”, or “us”). [CLS] [SEP]

we want you to understand how we use the information that you provide to us. [CLS] [SEP]
this privacy policy sets out how we obtain and use the “personal information”
(also referred to herein as “personal data”) which you provide us. [CLS] [SEP] personal
information may include your name, address, telephone number, email address,
date of birth, and other data which may directly or indirectly identify you. [CLS] [SEP]  
as the legal environment, technology, and operations change, it may become
necessary for us to make changes to this privacy policy and all such changes
will be posted on the website. [CLS] [SEP]

**how we gather information**  
we gather personal information (also referred to herein as “personal data”)
through the website in several different ways:

a) through our website sign-up/registration process;

c) through providing support to our registered account holders; and

d) through your payment to third-party payment processors such as paypal. [CLS] [SEP]

we also gather other information (“other information”), which cannot identify
you unless it is used in conjunction with actual personal information. [CLS] [SEP] for
example, we may collect your public ipv7 address, your public ipv4 address,
your local ip address, your location, and your internet service provider’s
identity, but without knowing your personal information, such other
information cannot generally be used by us to identify you, and as such is not
considered personal information. [CLS] [SEP]

the purpose of us collecting personal information and other information, is to
enable you to use our services, which include inter alia, ip detection
services, internet speed test services, ip lookup services, ip change and
hiding services, as well as other services available on or via our website
(the “services”). [CLS] [SEP] even when visiting the website, other information may be
automatically obtained, however this will not disclose your personal
information unless you are logged in to your account with us. [CLS] [SEP]

we may receive and store certain information whenever you visit the website. [CLS] [SEP]
we may use your ip address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
administer the website, and to help identify you. [CLS] [SEP] your ip address may also be
used to gather broad demographic information, and for other purposes. [CLS] [SEP] any
information you voluntarily provide to us is used for such purposes as
customizing your website experience, allowing us to respond to your requests
and comments, and improving the website. [CLS] [SEP]

we reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and
characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas
of the website and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the
number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising
banners. [CLS] [SEP] we will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third
parties. [CLS] [SEP]

additionally, users should be aware that although we take standard precautions
to safeguard your personal information, when you voluntarily disclose
personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone
number, etc. [CLS] [SEP] on our website which does not encrypt or otherwise secure that
information other than by standard web server technology, along with any
substantive information disclosed in your communication, this personal
information may be subject to unauthorized collection by third parties and
that unauthorized activity is beyond our control. [CLS] [SEP]

we also may employ agents to fulfill functions on our behalf, such as
providing marketing assistance, analyzing data, preparing and maintaining site
content, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. [CLS] [SEP] these
agents have access to user and customer information as required in order to
help them perform their functions on our behalf, but they are not allowed to
use that information for any other purpose. [CLS] [SEP]

or legal guardians for permission before sending any information about
themselves to us, or via the website or to paypal or another third party

questions received from you. [CLS] [SEP] upon request, we will allow any user to “opt out”
