### your content

nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual

other content you submit to the website. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in these terms gives you any
ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either. [CLS] [SEP]

between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you

to the website is sponsored or approved by the company. [CLS] [SEP] these terms do not
obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you
submit. [CLS] [SEP]

content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide what
permission to give others for it. [CLS] [SEP] but at a minimum, you license the company to
provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website. [CLS] [SEP]
that special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content
you submit to the website. [CLS] [SEP]

when content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the
company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from
the company’s backups, caches, and other systems. [CLS] [SEP] other licenses you apply to
content you submit may continue after your content is removed. [CLS] [SEP] those licenses
may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content
through the website again. [CLS] [SEP]

others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on
which you license your content. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that the company will not be liable
to you for those violations or their consequences. [CLS] [SEP]

### your responsibility

you agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your
breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account
on the website. [CLS] [SEP] both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any
legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as
possible. [CLS] [SEP] if the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you
won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended
against or mitigated with prompt notice. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to allow the company to
control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you
would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts. [CLS] [SEP] the
company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or
imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

### disclaimers

you accept all risk of using the website and content on the website. [CLS] [SEP] as far as
the law allows, the company provides the website as is, without any warranty
whatsoever. [CLS] [SEP]

the website may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by
others. [CLS] [SEP] the company does not make any warranty about services run by others,
or content they may provide. [CLS] [SEP] use of services run by others may be governed by
other terms between you and the one running the service. [CLS] [SEP]

### limits on liability

the company will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages company
personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

limited to $50. [CLS] [SEP]

### feedback

the company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the website. [CLS] [SEP] see the
contact section below for ways to get in touch with us. [CLS] [SEP]

you agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you
provide, and that the company won’t have to notify you that your feedback was
used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. [CLS] [SEP] you agree not to submit
feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary,
to you or others. [CLS] [SEP]

### termination

either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at
any time. [CLS] [SEP] when our agreement ends, your permission to use the website also
ends. [CLS] [SEP]

the following provisions survive the end of our agreement: your content,
feedback, your responsibility, disclaimers, limits on liability, and general
terms. [CLS] [SEP]

### disputes

california law will govern any dispute, including any legal proceedings,
related to these terms or your use of the website. [CLS] [SEP]

you and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in
state or federal court in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP] neither you nor the
company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts. [CLS] [SEP]

other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the computer fraud and
abuse act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding american
arbitration association arbitration. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration will follow the aaa’s
commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures for consumer related
disputes. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration will happen in san francisco, california. [CLS] [SEP] you will
settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or
other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member. [CLS] [SEP]
no arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without
the company’s permission. [CLS] [SEP]

any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable
attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. [CLS] [SEP] you or the company may
enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP]

### general terms

if a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be
changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. [CLS] [SEP] otherwise, that provision
should be removed. [CLS] [SEP]

you may not assign your agreement with the company. [CLS] [SEP] the company may assign
your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains
control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company
related to the website. [CLS] [SEP] any attempted assignment against these terms has no
legal effect. [CLS] [SEP]

neither the exercise of any right under this agreement, nor waiver of any
breach of this agreement, waives any other breach of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

these terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company
about use of the website. [CLS] [SEP] these terms entirely replace any other agreements
about your use of the website, written or not. [CLS] [SEP]

### contact

you may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the
company, at team@freecodecamp.org. [CLS] [SEP]

the company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you
provide for your account on the website, or by posting a message to the
homepage of the website or your account page. [CLS] [SEP]

### changes

the company last updated these terms on may 25, 2018, and may update these
terms again. [CLS] [SEP] the company will post all updates to the website. [CLS] [SEP] for updates
that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve
created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. [CLS] [SEP] the company may also
announce updates with special messages or alerts on the website. [CLS] [SEP]

terms in order to keep using the website. [CLS] [SEP]
