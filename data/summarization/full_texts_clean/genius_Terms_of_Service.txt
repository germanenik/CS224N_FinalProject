# genius terms of service

**last updated: june 24, 2020**

welcome to the services operated by genius media group, inc ("genius," "we,"
"us" or "our"), consisting of the website available at
[genius.com](https://genius.com/), the genius live website available at
[live.genius.com](https://live.genius.com/) ("genius live") and the other
online and/or mobile services, websites and software provided by genius
(collectively the "service"). [CLS] [SEP] by accessing or using the service, you ("you" or
"your"), signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these
genius terms of service (as amended from time to time, "terms") and to the
collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in our
[privacy policy](/static/privacy_policy), as modified from time to time and
which is incorporated by reference herein. [CLS] [SEP] these terms apply to all visitors,
users, and others who access the service ("users"). [CLS] [SEP]

if you are a united states federal agency, this
[amendment](/static/government_terms) is applied to the terms of service. [CLS] [SEP]

we provide the service for your use subject to the terms. [CLS] [SEP] we reserve the
right, in our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these terms at
any time. [CLS] [SEP] if we modify these terms, we will post a notice at the top of our
service for a period of seven (7) days. [CLS] [SEP] your continued use of the service
constitutes your acknowledgement of, acceptance of, and agreement to the
revised terms. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to periodically visit this page to review the current
terms so you are aware of any revision to which you are bound. [CLS] [SEP] we will
indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. [CLS] [SEP] if

(or continue to use or access) the service. [CLS] [SEP]

or provided via the service (including genius live), and you agree that you
shall be subject to any such terms that may be posted via the service or
otherwise made available to you from time to time. [CLS] [SEP] all such terms are hereby
incorporated by reference into these terms. [CLS] [SEP]

please read these terms carefully to ensure that you understand each
provision. [CLS] [SEP] these terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration and class
action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an
individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class
actions. [CLS] [SEP]

agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their
employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any
and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, injury (including
death), costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's
fees) arising from or relating to: (i) your use of and access to the service,
including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your
violation of any term or condition of these terms, including without
limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above;
(iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation
any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of
any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) your user content or any that is
submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party's access and use of the
service with your unique username, password or other appropriate security
code. [CLS] [SEP] for the avoidance of doubt, your indemnity obligations include, without
limitation, claims against genius that any of your user content infringes a
third party's intellectual property rights. [CLS] [SEP]

**_disclaimer of warranties_**

your use of the service is at your sole risk. [CLS] [SEP] the service is provided on an
"as is" and "as available" basis. [CLS] [SEP] genius expressly disclaims all warranties of
any kind, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to
the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title, and non-infringement. [CLS] [SEP]

genius makes no warranty that (i) the service will meet your requirements,
(ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, (iii)
the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate
or reliable, or (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or
other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your
expectations. [CLS] [SEP]

genius does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any
product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the genius
service or any hyperlinked website or service, and genius will not be a party
to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers
of products or services. [CLS] [SEP]

federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow
exclusions and limitations of certain implied warranties, so some of the above
limitations may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP]

**_limitation of liability_**

you expressly acknowledge and agree that genius shall not be liable for any
indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary damages, or damages
for loss of profits including but not limited to, damages for loss of
goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if genius has been
advised of the possibility of such damages), whether based on contract, tort,
negligence, strict liability or otherwise, resulting from: (i) the use or the
inability to use the service; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods
and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased
or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from
the service; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions
or data by any party; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the
service; (v) your user content; or (vi) any other matter relating to the
service. [CLS] [SEP] in no event shall genius' total liability to you for all damages,
losses or causes of action exceed the amount you have paid genius in the last
six (6) months, or, if greater, fifty dollars ($50). [CLS] [SEP]

some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for
incidental or consequential damages. [CLS] [SEP] accordingly, some of the limitations set
forth above may not apply to you. [CLS] [SEP] if you are dissatisfied with any portion of
the service or with these terms of service, your sole and exclusive remedy is
to discontinue use of the service. [CLS] [SEP]

the service is controlled and operated from facilities in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]
genius makes no representations that the service is appropriate or available
for use in other locations. [CLS] [SEP] those who access or use the service from other
jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for
compliance with all applicable united states and local laws and regulations,
including but not limited to export and import regulations. [CLS] [SEP] you may not use
the service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the united states,
or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the united states
government. [CLS] [SEP] unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the
service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities
located in the united states. [CLS] [SEP]

**_governing law, arbitration, and class action/jury trial waiver._**

**governing law:** you agree that: (i) the service shall be deemed solely
based in new york; and (ii) the service shall be deemed a passive one that
does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or
general, in jurisdictions other than new york. [CLS] [SEP] these terms will be governed by
the internal substantive laws of the state of new york, without respect to its
conflict of laws principles. [CLS] [SEP] the parties acknowledge that these terms evidence
a transaction involving interstate commerce. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the preceding
sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted
pursuant to these terms shall be governed by the federal arbitration act (9
u.s.c. [CLS] [SEP] §§ 1-16). [CLS] [SEP] the application of the united nations convention on contracts
for the international sale of goods is expressly excluded. [CLS] [SEP] you agree to submit
to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in new
york, new york for any actions for which genius retains the right to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation
of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the arbitration provision
below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. [CLS] [SEP]
you agree that new york, new york is the proper forum for any appeals of an
arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the
arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable. [CLS] [SEP]

**arbitration:** read this section carefully because it requires the parties
to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief
from genius. [CLS] [SEP] for any dispute with genius, you agree to first contact us at
[terms@genius.com](mailto:terms@genius.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute
with us informally. [CLS] [SEP] in the unlikely event that genius has not been able to
resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to
resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for
injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in
connection with or relating to these terms, or the breach or alleged breach
thereof (collectively, "claims"), by binding arbitration by jams, inc. [CLS] [SEP]
("jams"), under the optional expedited arbitration procedures then in effect
for jams, except as provided herein. [CLS] [SEP] jams may be contacted at
[www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com). [CLS] [SEP] the arbitration will be conducted
in new york, new york, unless you and genius agree otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using
the service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying
any jams filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with jams
rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of
arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and
other witnesses. [CLS] [SEP] if you are using the service for non-commercial purposes: (i)
jams may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you
apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from jams; (ii) the award
rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your
reasonable attorney's fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other
witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent
jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve
you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. [CLS] [SEP]
any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] nothing in this section shall be deemed as
preventing genius from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the
courts as necessary to protect any of genius's proprietary interests. [CLS] [SEP]

**class action/jury trial waiver:** with respect to all persons and entities,
regardless of whether they have obtained or used the service for personal,
commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties'
individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other
representative proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] this waiver applies to class arbitration, and,
unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person's claims. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and
genius are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
representative proceeding of any kind. [CLS] [SEP]

**_termination_**

in addition to the termination rights set forth elsewhere herein, you agree
that genius, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or
any part thereof) or use of the service and remove and discard any content
(including without limitation your user content) within the service, for any
reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if genius believes
that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of
these terms. [CLS] [SEP] any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be
grounds for termination of your use of service may be referred to appropriate
law enforcement authorities. [CLS] [SEP] genius may also in its sole discretion and at any
time discontinue providing the service, or any part thereof, with or without
notice. [CLS] [SEP] you agree that any termination of your access to the service under any
provision of these terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge
and agree that genius may immediately deactivate or delete your account and
all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further
access to such files or the service. [CLS] [SEP] further, you agree that genius shall not
be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the
service. [CLS] [SEP]

**_user disputes_**

you agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other
user in connection with the service and genius will have no liability or
responsibility with respect thereto. [CLS] [SEP] genius reserves the right, but has no
obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any
other user of the service or to elect to display only certain of the user
content submitted in connection with a particular genius subdomain. [CLS] [SEP]

**_assignment_**

these terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by genius without
restriction. [CLS] [SEP] any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be
null and void. [CLS] [SEP]

**_general_**

these terms constitute the entire agreement between you and genius and govern
your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements between you and
genius with respect to the service. [CLS] [SEP] you also may be subject to additional
terms and conditions that may apply when you use certain features of the
service, affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party
software. [CLS] [SEP] the failure of genius to exercise or enforce any right or provision
of these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. [CLS] [SEP] if
any provision of these terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to
give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
other provisions of these terms remain in full force and effect. [CLS] [SEP] you agree
that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
action arising out of or related to use of the service or these terms must be
filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be
forever barred, unless required otherwise by applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] a printed version
of these terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible
in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
form. [CLS] [SEP] the section titles in these terms are for convenience only and have no
legal or contractual effect. [CLS] [SEP] notices to you may be made via either email or
regular mail. [CLS] [SEP] the service may also provide notices to you of changes to these
terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on
the service. [CLS] [SEP]
