# riseup and government faq

  1. [CLS] [SEP] is riseup working with the nsa?
  2. [CLS] [SEP] but your servers are located in the u.s., doesnât that mean you have to install backdoors/monitoring/etc?
  3. [CLS] [SEP] how is riseup different than lavabit and silent circle?
  4. [CLS] [SEP] what if someone (like law enforcement) takes riseupâs servers?
  5. [CLS] [SEP] how can i limit the amount of data that riseup stores for me?
  6. [CLS] [SEP] will riseup services last forever?
  7. [CLS] [SEP] what about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc. [CLS] [SEP] would you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things?

we have received your emails asking a number of good questions in light of
last week's news about [lavabit and silentcircle closing
down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/09/lavabit-email-edward-
snowden-shuts-down). [CLS] [SEP] we would like to clearly state that riseup has never
given any user information to any third party. [CLS] [SEP] we have never permitted
installation of any hardware or software monitoring on any system that we
control. [CLS] [SEP]

we will do everything in our power to protect the data of social movements and
activists, short of extended incarceration. [CLS] [SEP] we would rather pull the plug than
submit to repressive surveillance by our government, or any government. [CLS] [SEP] we are
doing everything we can, as quickly as possible, to forge forward with options
that would prevent us from having to shut down, in case we are faced with
making such a decision. [CLS] [SEP] in cooperation with other groups, we are hard at work
to develop and deploy a radical new infrastructure that would allow us to
provide email in a way that is a thousand times more secure and that would
prevent us from having access to any user's data. [CLS] [SEP] we have been working on this
for over a year, but we have a lot more work to do before it is finalized. [CLS] [SEP]

don't panic. [CLS] [SEP] here are some questions and answers. [CLS] [SEP]

### is riseup working with the nsa?

we would rather stop being riseup before we did that. [CLS] [SEP] we are not working with
any government agency. [CLS] [SEP] we have never simply handed over information when
requested, and for years have had a no logging policy. [CLS] [SEP] we have fought and won
every time anyone has tried to get us to give up information. [CLS] [SEP] we have never
turned over any user data to any third party, fourth party, fifth party or any
party. [CLS] [SEP]

### but your servers are located in the u.s., doesnât that mean you have to
install backdoors/monitoring/etc?

we have no control over our network providers, but we have physical control of
our servers, they are not hosted "in the cloud." this gives us much more
physical assurance of the security of our machines. [CLS] [SEP] we would not consent to
the installation of any external hardware or software on our network and would
end the organization rather than install any. [CLS] [SEP] however, once our fiber
connections leave our space, they could be monitored. [CLS] [SEP] this is not new, and has
been our assumption from the beginning. [CLS] [SEP] when you send an email to someone with
an email hosted elsewhere, we have no control over it once it leaves our
servers. [CLS] [SEP] also, the us still has _better_ laws for internet providers than in
many other countries, including many places in europe, where there are data
retention laws requiring providers to keep logs. [CLS] [SEP] the us has no such
requirement and it has been our policy for years to not keep any logs. [CLS] [SEP]

### how is riseup different than lavabit and silent circle?

these were commercial services whose primary mission was to provide paid
private email. [CLS] [SEP] riseup is different in that we are a non-profit whose goal is
to support activists and keep them safe. [CLS] [SEP] those companies were for-profit
businesses, riseup is in it for social change!

### what if someone (like law enforcement) takes riseupâs servers?

they have in the past! this usually happens when they want logs, we tell them
that we don't have any and then they come and take the machine because they
don't believe us and want to see for themselves. [CLS] [SEP] however, all of our servers
use full disk encryption, which means they cannot see or do anything with the
data on the disks without the keys. [CLS] [SEP] nevertheless, we do not keep ip
identifying logs, and store as little data as possible on our users. [CLS] [SEP] but this
is not just riseup's responsibility, each user is responsible for limiting the
amount of data that riseup stores for them!

### how can i limit the amount of data that riseup stores for me?

there are several ways

**account info:** when you applied for an account you provided a little
information. [CLS] [SEP] after you are approved we don't need this information anymore and
you can clean it up. [CLS] [SEP] login to user.riseup.net and review the information that
you have provided there and consider what information you have given us that
identifies you. [CLS] [SEP] for example, if obama had a secret email address with riseup
and applied for the address using
[president@whitehouse.gov](mailto:president@whitehouse.gov) as his alternate
email address, it would be a good idea for him to remove
[president@whitehouse.gov](mailto:president@whitehouse.gov) from his alternate
email if he wanted to be able to engage in constitutionally-protected,
anonymous, speech. [CLS] [SEP]

but please note: if you do remove your alternate email, and you later
lose/forget your password, it will _not be possible_ for us to reset your
password. [CLS] [SEP] you will be permanently locked out of your account and will not be
able to access your emails. [CLS] [SEP] you have been warned!

**email:** if you are not already, consider using an email client that lets
you download email via the pop protocol and deletes it from the server. [CLS] [SEP] there
is no getting around the mail arriving on riseup's server, but if you download
it and it's deleted from the server then riseup doesn't have it anymore. [CLS] [SEP] but
note this does have a downside, using webmail or the imap protocol does allow
you to check email from more than one computer. [CLS] [SEP] if you need that ability, one
approach might be to move older email offline to a single computer and just
check newer things from multiple locations. [CLS] [SEP] here are some directions for
[downloading your email](/en/email/clients/downloading-email). [CLS] [SEP]

**lists:** one of the nice features of having a mailing list is having a
message archive. [CLS] [SEP] but if the idea of someone you don't want getting access to
that archive scares you, then it might be better to do without an archive or
periodically move the archive to a more secure location. [CLS] [SEP] but don't forget that
any subscriber to your list gets a copy of every message, so even if you have
the archives removed, there is nothing that prevents subscribers from leaking
those messages! more info at: [downloading list archives](/en/lists/list-
admin/maintenance/archives). [CLS] [SEP]

**ask yourself:** where are the important emails, documents, and manifestos of
your group stored? do you have a good place for them for people to find when
you are gone and people want to write the history about how you changed the
world? if they are only stored in riseup, that isnât good. [CLS] [SEP] download them and
put them somewhere safer! we are birds, so we like eggs, but we don't like
people putting all their eggs in our basket. [CLS] [SEP]

### will riseup services last forever?

while we are committed to doing everything in our power to protect the data of
social movements and activists, short of extended incarceration, we would
rather pull the plug than submit to repressive surveillance by any government. [CLS] [SEP]
we would be really sad to see riseup go, but if we are forced to, we would
rather it go away than to betray your trust and compromise the activist
community. [CLS] [SEP] with this in mind, you should be sure you are prepared in case
something does happen, such as downloading and archive your email on your own
computer!

### what about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc. [CLS] [SEP] would you fight law
enforcement requests for users doing these things?

those things violate riseup's terms of service and, unlike some more "american
libertarian" service providers, we do not exist to provide privacy for doing
anything you want. [CLS] [SEP] we would close the accounts of people doing those things
and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather
than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization, and your email. [CLS] [SEP]
