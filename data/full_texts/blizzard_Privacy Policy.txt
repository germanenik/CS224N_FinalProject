us/legal/e37112bf-8b02-4df5-b661-f57849b0b1dd/additional-information-
california-collection-notice) for the california collection notice

blizzard entertainment and its subsidiaries (collectively "blizzard") respects
the privacy of its players and online visitors; and recognizes the importance
of providing a secure environment for them. we have adopted a company-wide
online privacy policy (“privacy policy”) that explains how we collect, store,
and use the information you provide us. this privacy policy details how
blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to
information that may be collected by blizzard offline, including but not
limited to employment related interactions. when you click a link to other
sites from a blizzard website, this privacy policy does not apply to, and
cannot control the activities on, those other sites. we highly recommend that
you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to
before providing any personally identifiable information.

the personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and
processed within the united states or other countries where blizzard maintains
facilities or business operations.

by using this website and/or any of blizzard’s online products or services,
you acknowledge the terms of this privacy policy. if you object to anything
described in this privacy policy, please do not use our websites or play our
games. this privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check back
periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. if we make a
material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you by posting the
change on our websites or in this privacy policy and, if necessary, give you
additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.
your continued use of the blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of
these changes.

this privacy policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that
blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of
the [entertainment software rating board’s privacy certified
program](https://www.esrb.org/privacy/) (“esrb privacy certified”). esrb
privacy certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use
and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. to protect your
privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of
our websites where this privacy policy is posted have been reviewed and
certified by esrb privacy certified to meet established online information
collection, use and disclosure practices.

## 1\. what personal information is collected and how do we use it?

**information collected from you.** if an online visitor submits information
to blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or
services though our online platforms, (2) product or account registration, or
registration for online game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4)
message boards or forums, (5) ecards or recruit-a-friend e-mails, (6) warranty
registrations, (7) contest registrations, (8) the playing of a game or use of
a service, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical support, (11) share
wish list feature, and/or (12) newsletters. personal information collected may
include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. we do
not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will
not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require
registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information
is provided.

visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional
information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping
and billing addresses.

for some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or
to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not
limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform
preferences; and, we may combine such information with other personal and/or
non-personal information.

in specific cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or
government-issued id to verify your identity, location, and/or account
ownership. when photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted
as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the
case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required
to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.

from time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain
personally identifiable information on blizzard’s websites. however, we will
obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication
in accordance with the applicable blizzard agreement.

additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be
considered private. blizzard may monitor and/or record your communications
(including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or
service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud, or for
enforcement of blizzard’s end user license agreement (eula) and/or terms of
use. you hereby provide your irrevocable, express consent to such monitoring
and recording. you acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of
privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or
communications, including without limitation chat text or voice
communications. because voice chat and other communications may be viewed
and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally
identifiable information in those communications.

**information collected automatically.** in addition, your web browser or
client software may transmit certain geographic information or information
regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to
blizzard. blizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics
about our user community. in addition, blizzard may use such information for
security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or
enforcement purposes. blizzard may also collect ip information, which it may
use to infer your approximate location.

**information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and
business partners).** blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information
collected at a blizzard website with data from third parties in order to
update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our
products, services, or systems. if you register an account using your facebook
credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and
last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your
friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account. similar
data exchanges will occur when you link your blizzard account with other
companies, such as twitch and console platforms.

**how we use your information.** the personal information you provide
blizzard, and that blizzard collects automatically, will allow us to provide
our games and services, fulfill your product or service order; alert you of
new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your
customer service or technical support questions or issues; to send ecards or
“recruit-a-friend” emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities,
contests, promotions, or special events and offers. we also use this
information to secure our services and users, to prevent cheating and fraud,
to monitor for toxicity, and to enforce our agreements with you.

additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be
considered private. by using the speech to text feature in voice chat, you
understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to
text, including for accessibility purposes. we do not retain the chat
transcription after you end the session and close the chat window. however, by
using voice or text chat, you understand that your communications may be
monitored and/or recorded for accessibility, toxicity analysis (e.g. toxic
player behavior), to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of
blizzard’s end user license agreement (eula) and/or terms of use. you
acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the
transmission of any user generated content or communications, including
without limitation chat text, voice communications, or speech to text for
transcription purposes. because voice chat and other communications may be
viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any
personally identifiable information in those communications.

last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or
demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better
suit your needs. we do this to better understand and serve our customers.

personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business
capacity is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices
stated in this privacy policy. this includes employees and former employees.

**additional information (california collection notice).** below we identify
each category of personal information that we have collected in the last 12
months. for each category of personal information we have collected, we also
identify (i) the source(s) from which the information was collected; (ii) the
purpose(s) for which it was collected; and (iii) the categories of third
parties, if any, with which it has been shared.

## 2\. what type of communications may you receive?

### offers

we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special
deals, and promotions. out of respect for your privacy, we present the option
not to receive these communications. please see the “choice” section below.

### service-related announcements

we will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when
it is necessary to do so. you will also receive communication regarding your
account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related
to changes and suspicious login activity on your account. generally, you may
not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

### game-related announcements

we may send you information related to the game(s) you play. for instance, we
may congratulate you on your recent success.

### customer service

based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will
send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. we will also
communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services
you request, and to manage your account.

### recruit a friend/e-cards/share wish list

if you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, share wish list, or e-card
features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. we will
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit
the website. blizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to
send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.

## 3\. who is collecting your information?

when you are asked for information while on a blizzard website or in a
blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to blizzard
entertainment, inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise
in that location or in this privacy policy.

occasionally, blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process
personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).
in these instances, blizzard controls the use of your data via written
contracts which conform to this privacy policy.

in addition, some services are provided with partner companies. for instance,
if you purchase something from blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via
fedex, your information will be collected by fedex. if you do not want your
information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by
not using that service or by not providing any information. please be aware
that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we
provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same
privacy and security procedures as blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to
assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal
information.

our websites may include certain social media features such as the facebook
"like" button, and widgets such as the share this button or interactive mini-
programs that run on our websites. these features may collect your internet
protocol (“ip”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may
set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. social media features
and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.
your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of
the company providing it.

## 4\. with whom may your personal information be shared?

blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the
ways that are described in this privacy policy.

we may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public
information with third parties. additionally, we share unique identifiers
specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and
improve our services.

we may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the
purposes described in this privacy policy. if you purchase a product or
license a game from another company on our battle.net platform, we may share
some of your account information with that company so they may establish a
direct relationship with you. because of that sharing, you may receive
communications from that company.

we share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who
create applications and websites that benefit our player community. you may
opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of
game-data sharing in the privacy section of battle.net account management.

we reserve the right to disclose your information if we are required to do so
by law. we may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil
litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal
obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the
eula).

we may share your information with vendors blizzard engages to perform
services for blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event
ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer
services support, information technology hardware and software). in these
situations, a written contract between blizzard and the vendor shall control
such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security
regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data
except as required for the performance of those services for blizzard. if your
data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.

as with any business, your personal information is also an asset of blizzard
and will become part of our normal business records. as such, we may also
disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a
line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service
and information in connection with that line of business with as little
disruption as possible. similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition,
reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information
may be transferred to blizzard's successor or assign.

blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users
can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. when posting to a message
board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available
online and the user does so at his or her own risk. for certain forums, anyone
posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their real id -- that is,
their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of
their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding real id below). if
your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may
contact us at [dataprivacy@blizzard.com](mailto:dataprivacy@blizzard.com) to
request removal. sometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal
information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.

## 5\. what choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and
distribution of your personal information?

you have choices over the information provided by you and by other sources,
and how blizzard uses that information. you can exercise your choices by
updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in
your battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.

### your choices about information provided by you

if you do not want to provide blizzard with personal information, then you can
choose not to provide it. if you choose not to provide us with personal
information, we may not always be able to provide you with the blizzard
product or service you want. for example, without providing an email address,
you cannot create a battle.net account.

### your choices about information provided by third parties

you may control how third parties collect and share your information by
changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those
third parties. before disclosing information to third parties, we recommend
you check their respective privacy policies for further details.

### your choices about blizzard using your information

you can exercise choices over how blizzard uses your personal information and
update your preferences at any time:

• to remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters
from blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your
battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences. you will
need your password to access your account;

• to disable selected cookies from collecting information relating to the
effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you
with personalized advertising, please see our [cookie
policy](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/cookies); and

• to remove having your game-data available to our community of application
developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the privacy section of battle.net
account management.

if you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please
note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account,
such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service
related information.

## 6\. california residents: your california privacy rights

### california consumer protection act

without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, california
law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal
information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of
the sale of your personal information (if we sell such information), subject
to certain restrictions. for security purposes, we will verify your identity –
in part by requesting certain information from you -- when you request to
exercise your california privacy rights. you also have the right to designate
an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. this section describes how
to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.

**right to know:**  
if you are a california resident, you may submit, free of charge, but no more
than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the following
information:

• the specific pieces of personal information we have about you;

• the categories of personal information we collected, sold, or disclosed for
a business purpose about you within the last 12 months;

• the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;

• the purposes for which the information was collected or sold; and

• the categories of third parties to whom the information was sold, disclosed
for a business purpose, or otherwise shared.

if possible, we will provide this information to you in a readily usable
format that allows transmission to another entity. the easiest way to submit a
request and receive your report is to click here to access our online
[webform](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327);
alternatively, you may fill out this [form](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/3039ecc8-387d-41a1-ab03-d3c5b0d77131/blizzard-right-to-know) and then
mail your request to blizzard entertainment, one blizzard way, irvine, ca
92618-3616, usa, attention: data protection team. if we need additional
information to verify your identity, we will contact you to request that
information, which may include personal information about you or information
about your past purchases or use of blizzard’s products or services. if we
deny your request, even if only in part, we will explain the reason in our
response.

**right to data portability:**  
data portability is the ability to move data from one company to another (for
instance, when you transfer your mobile phone service to another carrier).
while this right is not very applicable to blizzard’s current business, we
will provide you with an electronic file with your most basic account
information, should you request it. the easiest way to submit a request is to
click here to access our online
[webform](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327) ; you
may fill out this [form](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/db319806-ae84-458e-8593-5161c0fde19c/blizzard-portability) and then
mail your request to blizzard entertainment, one blizzard way, irvine, ca
92618-3616, usa, attention: data protection team.

**right to delete:**  
if you are a california resident, you may submit a verifiable request for us
to delete the personal information we have collected about you. **the deletion
of a battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed; also, all games,
assets and history will also be permanently deleted.** we may retain personal
information necessary to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from
fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing
functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech
or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful
process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal
purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with
legal obligations. additionally, we need certain types of information so we
can provide our games and services to you. the easiest way to submit a request
for deletion is to click here to access our online
[webform](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327); you
may fill out this [form](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/14c3059f-905b-4b2c-9456-12a6e77dbc6c/blizzard-right-to-delete) and
then mail your request to blizzard entertainment, one blizzard way, irvine, ca
92618-3616, usa, attention: data protection team. if we need additional
information to verify your identity, we will contact you to request that
information. if we deny your request, even if only we will explain the reason
in our response.

**right to opt-out:**  
california residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information,
as defined by the ccpa. this does not include when:

• you direct us to disclose your personal information or use us to interact
with a third party and the third party does not sell the personal information;  
• we use or share an identifier solely to alert a third party you have opted
out of the sale of your personal information;  
• your personal information is transferred as an asset as part of a
transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of our
business, in which case the third party would have to tell you in writing if
it materially changes how the information is used or shared; and  
• we use or share your personal information under a written contract with a
service provider necessary to perform a business purpose. here, the service
the service provider performs is on our behalf, and our written contract
prohibits it from keeping, using or disclosing your personal information for
any purpose other than for the specific purpose identified in the contract.

in these cases, the disclosure of your personal information would not be
considered a “sale” under ccpa. we use and share your information as described
in this privacy policy and do not believe this use and sharing is a sale as
defined by the ccpa. we have not sold personal information about you in the
last 12 months and currently have no plans to do so in the future. however, we
have provided you with a system to record your preference that your data not
be sold in the future. you may make this request by clicking this
[link](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/a97631bf-2b21-4755-a740-5934bd5cb632/do-not-sell-my-personal-
information) or by filling out this [form](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/965284ab-1cf2-4370-92db-880b83b8ee20/blizzard-right-to-opt-out) and
mailing it to us at blizzard entertainment, one blizzard way, irvine, ca
92618-3616, usa, attention: data protection team.

**right to be free from discrimination:**  
we may not discriminate against you because you have exercised your rights,
including, for example, by denying you access to our online services or
charging you different rates or prices for the same online services, unless
that difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your data.

**authorized agents:**  
if you would like to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your
behalf, please be sure the agent can (i) demonstrate you have provided written
permission for the agent to submit the request on your behalf, and (ii)
provide proof of his or her own identity. if the agent does not satisfy these
requirements, we will deny the request.

### california shine the light law

settings. as do not track is a standard that is currently being developed,
blizzard does not take actions to respond to do not track settings, and
instead we adhere to the standards set out in this privacy policy. to find out
more about do not track you may find the following link useful:

## 7\. privacy information for nevada residents

under nevada law, nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from
us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are
defined under nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that
person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “covered
information” includes first and last name, address, email address, and phone
number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either
physically or online. at blizzard, we do not sell your personal information.
nonetheless, if you are a nevada resident who has purchased goods or services
from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt out for the
future.

## 8\. children and parents

**children under 13**  
once a child states that his/her age is under 13, they will be unable to
register an account with us. we do not knowingly collect or store any
personally identifiable information from children under 13. if parents believe
that we have unintentionally collected their children’s’ personal information,
they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at blizzard
entertainment privacy policy, attention: privacy policy administrator, one
blizzard way, irvine ca usa 92618-3616. they may also e-mail us at
[dataprivacy@blizzard.com](mailto:dataprivacy@blizzard.com).

**note to parents**  
we recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about young
children. we urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their
real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online.
teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their
parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke
our opt-out capabilities or to raise any concerns. for more information, you
may visit our parental controls area at
<https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/index.html>.

## 9\. what is real id?

real id friends can see each other’s real-life name and can see each other’s
characters across all blizzard products and services. by participating in real
id, you will have the option of making your real name visible to your friend’s
friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends. the controls
for real id are located in battle.net account management.

when you and a friend mutually agree to become real id friends, you will have
access to several additional features, including:

• real names for friends: your real id friends will appear under their real-
life names on your friends list, when chatting, communicating in-game, or
viewing a character's profile.

• cross-realm and cross-game chat: with real id, friends can chat cross-realm,
cross-faction, and cross-game using blizzard’s products and services.

• rich presence: you will see additional info on your friends list about what
your real id friends are up to in blizzard’s products and services in real
time.

## 10\. what is global play?

certain blizzard games feature "global play," which allows you to play with
other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your
blizzard account. this feature is very beneficial to players who travel
frequently or have friends and family in other regions. the global play
feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you
provided when you created your blizzard account be transferred to servers
operated by blizzard in other regions.

## 11\. what are tracking technologies and how are they used?

as is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and
store it in log files. this information may include a unique identifier such
as your internet protocol (ip) address and non-personal information such as
your browser type, internet service provider (isp), referring/exit pages,
operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. we may combine
this automatically collected log information with other information we collect
about you. we do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve
marketing, analytics, or website functionality.

blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers
([listed here](https://www.blizzard.com/en-
us/legal/7fac8c01-ac9c-4c51-82ec-1f535e1f54ba/marketing-partners)), may use
tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts. these
technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites,
tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic
information about our user base. we may receive reports based on the use of
these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

we use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember
users’ settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. users can
control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. if you reject
cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or
areas of our websites may be limited.

we may also use clear gifs in our html-based emails to let us know which
e-mails have been opened by recipients. this allows us to gauge the
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
campaigns. these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable
information.

we, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our
websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use
local shared objects such as flash cookies, and local storage such as html5,
to store content information and preferences. various browsers may offer their
own management tools for removing html5. to manage flash cookies, lease [click
here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

we partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other
sites. our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect
information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you
targeted advertising based upon your interests. some of these ad networks are
members of the networking advertising initiative (“nai”) and/or the digital
advertising alliance (“daa”) – organizations who offer a single location to
opt out of receiving tailored ads. if you wish to not have your information
used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the [daa’s
consumer choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and/or the [nai’s
consumer opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). please
note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. you will continue
to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. please also note that we strive to
adhere to the [daa’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral
advertising](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/daa_files/seven-
principles-07-01-09.pdf).

## 12\. what are internet protocol addresses?

an internet protocol ("ip") address is the unique number assigned to your
server or internet service provider ("isp"). blizzard may track such ip
addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site
tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. see
the tracking technology discussion above.

## 13\. what do you do to obtain a report about the personal information
blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?

you may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a
verifiable request for the personal information we have about you. to obtain
the report, click here to access our online
[webform](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327).

you may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your
marketing information; or (2) your battle.net account and your marketing
information. **the deletion of a battle.net account is permanent and cannot be
reversed; also, all games, assets and history will also be permanently
deleted.** we may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business,
systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues
that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to
exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement
requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical
research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your
relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. to submit a request
for deletion, click here to access our online
[webform](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327).

note: california residents may have additional rights; please see section 6.

## 14\. how secure is your personal information?

blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal
information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature,
for example, publicly-available information like user generated content,
leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.). we also take steps to
ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and
alteration. in addition, we request vendors who process personal information
on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help
protect your personal information. however, the internet by its nature is not
a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving,
as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to
management of those risks. the complete security of any personal information
collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.

it is very important for you to understand that you control the security of
your account to a great extent. choosing a password you don’t use on any other
system is important. changing that password occasionally is also a good idea.
another way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free
blizzard authenticator app to your phone; just go to the app store for your
phone and download it at no cost to you.

## 15\. help for people with disabilities:

if you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this
privacy policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.
