privacy policy describes our practices in connection with information
collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications

news services"). california residents, please see the california consumer
privacy act notice in section 8 below. by using fox news services, you agree
to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. a list of our affiliated
companies ("fox news affiliates") is available at
[www.foxcorporation.com](//www.foxcorporation.com).

as set forth in our [terms of use](//www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use), the fox
news services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do
not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of
age.

this privacy policy applies to all users, including both those who use the fox
news services without being registered with or subscribing to a fox news
services and those who have registered with or subscribed to a fox news
service. this privacy policy applies to our collection and use of your
personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person,
such as full name or email address). it also describes generally our practices
for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics
and services usage).

### 2) collection of information

fox news and our service providers may collect the following information from
and about you:

**registration information** is the information you submit to register for a
fox news service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a
newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. registration information may
include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, household income,
political views, and birthday.

**public information and posts** consist of comments or content that you post
to the fox news services and the information about you that accompanies those
posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes,
status, profile information and picture. public information and posts are
always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed
in search results on external search engines.

**information from social media.** if you access or log-in to a fox news
service through a social media service or connect a fox news service to a
social media service, the information we collect may also include your user id
and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or
content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as
your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you
have made public in connection with that social media service. when you access
the fox news services through social media services or when you connect a fox
news service to social media services, you are authorizing fox news to
collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this
privacy policy.

**activity information.** when you access and interact with the fox news
services, fox news and its service providers may collect certain information
about those visits. for example, in order to permit your connection to the fox
news services, our servers receive and record information about your computer,
device, and browser, including potentially your ip address, browser type, and
other software or hardware information. if you access the fox news services
from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier
assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location),
or other transactional information for that device.

cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels,
beacons, and local storage, including cookies) are comprised of small bits of
data. our websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser
when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or
other device so the website or app can access information when you make
subsequent requests for pages from that service. these technologies may also
be used to collect and store information about your usage of the fox news
services, such as pages you have visited, and the video and other content you
have viewed.

other parties that support the fox news services by serving advertisements or
providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking
aggregate fox news services usage statistics, may also use these technologies
to collect similar information when you use the fox news services or other
parties’ services. those parties may also use these technologies, along with
activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you
use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. fox news does not
control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies
of parties using such technologies. for more information about third-party
advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies,
including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "to
deliver relevant advertisements," below.

your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your
settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block
cookies altogether. please consult the "help" section of your browser for more
information. users can manage the use of flash technologies, with the flash
management tools available at adobe’s website, see
[www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html](//www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).
please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to
certain features, content or personalization available through the fox news
services.

**information from other sources.** we may supplement the information we
collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available
information about your online and offline activity from social media services,
commercially available sources, and information from our fox news affiliates
or business partners.

**do not track signals.** at this time we do not respond to browser ‘do not
track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to
develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.

### 3) use and disclosure

news services and features to you, including: to measure and improve those fox

  * **to provide co-branded services and features.** we may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies ("co-branded services"). these co-branded services may be hosted on fox news services or on that other party’s service. by virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the co-branded service with that party. that other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy.
  * **to deliver relevant advertisements.** fox news and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this privacy policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the fox news services or another service (on any of your devices). this may include, for example, sharing email address (in hashed form), ip address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers. in some instances, these entities may return an online identification code that we may store in a first party cookie, or other similar technology, for our use in online and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. to opt out of this use, please [click here](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out) [(https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out).](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out)

### 4) security

privacy policy was last revised. any changes to this privacy policy will
become effective when we post the revised privacy policy on the fox news
services.

**location of data.** the fox news services are hosted in and managed from the
united states. if you are a user located outside the united states, you
understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the
united states or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which

circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or
security authorities in the united states may be entitled to access your
personal information.

unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content,
functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications

provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in
connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or
in connection with the fox news services.

**collection of personal financial information by a payment service.** in some
cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a
product or make payments ("payment service"). if you wish to purchase a
product or make a payment using a payment service, you will be directed to a
payment service webpage. any information that you provide to a payment service
will be subject to the applicable payment service’s privacy policy, rather
than this privacy policy. we have no control over, and are not responsible
for, any payment service’s use of information collected through any payment
service..

**data retention.** we will retain your information for the period necessary
to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer

remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete
your personal information, copies of some information from your account may
remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared
information with social media or other services. because of the nature of
caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others.
we may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers
for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud
detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or
recordkeeping policies. it may not always be possible to completely remove or
delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual,
financial or legal requirements.
