this policy explains in detail how “phpbb.com” along with its affiliated
companies (hereinafter “we”, “us”, “our”, “phpbb.com”,
“https://www.phpbb.com/community”) and phpbb (hereinafter “they”, “them”,
“their”, “phpbb software”, “www.phpbb.com”, “phpbb limited”, “phpbb teams”)
use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter
“your information”).  
  
your information is collected via two ways. firstly, by browsing “phpbb.com”
will cause the phpbb software to create a number of cookies, which are small
text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary
files. the first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter
“user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter “session-id”),
automatically assigned to you by the phpbb software. a third cookie will be
created once you have browsed topics within “phpbb.com” and is used to store
which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.  
  
we may also create cookies external to the phpbb software whilst browsing
“phpbb.com”, though these are outside the scope of this document which is
intended to only cover the pages created by the phpbb software. the second way
in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. this can be,
and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter “anonymous
posts”), registering on “phpbb.com” (hereinafter “your account”) and posts
submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter “your
posts”).  
  
your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name
(hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your
account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid e-mail address
(hereinafter “your e-mail”). your information for your account at “phpbb.com”
is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us.
any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address
required by “phpbb.com” during the registration process is either mandatory or
optional, at the discretion of “phpbb.com”. in all cases, you have the option
of what information in your account is publicly displayed. furthermore, within
your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically
generated e-mails from the phpbb software.  
  
your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. however, it
is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of
different websites. your password is the means of accessing your account at
“phpbb.com”, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will
anyone affiliated with “phpbb.com”, phpbb or another 3rd party, legitimately
ask you for your password. should you forget your password for your account,
you can use the “i forgot my password” feature provided by the phpbb software.
this process will ask you to submit your user name and your e-mail, then the
phpbb software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.
