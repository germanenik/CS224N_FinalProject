  1. general
**

    1. as long as you comply with the agreement, apple grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to enter and use the site.
    2. in addition to the terms and conditions in the agreement, all use of the site is governed by the [apple website terms of use](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html).
    3. in the event of any conflict between this agreement and the apple website terms of use, the terms of this agreement will govern for use of the site.
    4. views expressed on the site are not endorsed by apple.
    5. apple does not prescreen content, including but not limited to questions, statements, images, avatars and links, submitted by users of the site ("submissions"). apple retains the right, but not the responsibility, to edit or remove any submission, including those deemed by apple to violate the agreement. apple will make good faith efforts to investigate allegations that submissions violate the agreement but (a) makes no warranty to you that it will edit, remove, or continue to permit the display of any specific submission, whether or not subject to such allegations, and (b) will have no liability whatsoever for editing, removing, or continuing to permit the display of any submission whatsoever.
    6. some submissions may contain information about products not manufactured by apple or links to independent websites not controlled or tested by apple. information about non-apple products or links to non-apple websites are provided without recommendation or endorsement by apple. apple assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, or use of third-party websites or products. apple makes no representations regarding third-party website accuracy or reliability. apple may remove links to third-party websites containing information about products or instructions that could damage a user’s device, create a potential safety risk, or invalidate apple’s limited warranty.
    7. apple may respond to questions but does not formally provide technical support on the site.
    8. apple may offer certain benefits and privileges for your participation in the site. the benefits and privileges provided do not create an employee, agency or independent contractor relationship between you and apple, and you may not present yourself as a spokesperson for apple.
    9. apple may use cookies and other technologies within apple support communities. such cookies enable us to maintain your session and to personalize your experience on the site, help us measure the effectiveness of the site, and improve user experience. for more information, see [https://discussions.apple.com/privacy](/privacy).
