    * 9.15. **contracting party, choice of law and location for resolving disputes.** the logmein contracting entity, contact information, and governing law for your use of the services will depend on where you are and the specific services you have ordered, as set forth here: <https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/contracting-entities>.
