  10.  **legal disputes and arbitration agreement for users in the united states and canada  
  
** please read the following clause carefully – it may significantly affect
your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court

    1.  **initial dispute resolution**. we are available by email at [support@quora.com](mailto:support@quora.com) and by regular post at quora, inc., 605 castro street, mountain view, ca 94041 to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the quora platform. most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. the parties agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations with us, before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
    2.  **agreement to binding arbitration**. if an agreed upon solution is not reached through informal dispute resolution as outlined above within a period of thirty (30) days pursuant to the initial dispute resolution procedure provided in section 10(a) above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms and exclusion set forth below. all claims arising out of or relating to these terms of service (including their formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the quora platform will be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by aaa, in accordance with the aaa consumer arbitration rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. the parties will select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the aaa consumer arbitration rules. the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms of service, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these terms of service is void or voidable. either party may elect to appear at the arbitration by phone or, if mutually agreed, to conduct it online, in lieu of appearing live. the arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. the arbitrator’s award will be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. the interpretation and enforcement of these terms of service will be subject to the federal arbitration act.
    3.  **rules**. the aaa rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <https://www.adr.org/>. each party will be responsible for its arbitration fees as set forth in the aaa consumer arbitration rules. you will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration. the parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. they further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
    4.  **class action and class arbitration waiver**. the parties each further agree that any arbitration will be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and each expressly waives its respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. if any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in section 10(b) will be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
    5.  **exception: small claims court claims**. notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction and on an individual (non-class) basis only.
    6.  **exception: intellectual property and content claims**. notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, this binding arbitration section does not apply to disputes relating to either party’s intellectual property rights (trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret) or violations of quora’s acceptable use policy. for further clarification, disputes relating to your privacy rights are not excepted from this binding arbitration section.
    7.  **30 day right to opt-out**. you have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in sections 10(b) and 10(c) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at [legal@quora.com](mailto:legal@quora.com)[. ](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/)the notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the quora platform, otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. if you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
    8.  **exclusive venue for litigation**. to the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in section 10(b) do not apply, or if you have opted out of arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them must be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in santa clara county, california (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). the parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in santa clara county, california for any litigation other than small claims court actions. in the event of litigation relating to these terms of service, the parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.
  11.  **general terms**
    1.  **changes to these terms of service**. we may amend this agreement (including any policies, such as the [_privacy policy_](/about/privacy) , [_acceptable use policy_](/about/acceptable_use) , [_copyright policy_](/about/copyright) , and [_trademark policy_](/about/trademark) that are incorporated into this agreement) at any time, in our sole discretion. if we amend material terms to this agreement, such amendment will be effective after we send you notice of the amended agreement. such notice will be in our sole discretion, and the manner of notification could include, for example, via email, posted notice on the quora platform, or other manner. you can view the agreement and our main policies at any time [_here_](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038188411). your failure to cancel your account, or cease use of the quora platform, after receiving notification of the amendment, will constitute your acceptance of the amended terms. if you do not agree to the amendments or to any of the terms in this agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your account or to cease use of the quora platform.
