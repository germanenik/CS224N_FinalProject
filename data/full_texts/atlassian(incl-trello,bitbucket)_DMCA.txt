#  reporting copyright and trademark violations

_effective starting: november 1, 2018_

atlassian respects the rights of copyright and trademark holders, as described
in this policy. this policy is incorporated by reference into the atlassian
[cloud terms of service](/legal/cloud-terms-of-service) (the **“agreement”**
). terms used in this policy shall have the same definitions as in the
agreement or our [acceptable use policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy), as
applicable, except where otherwise noted.

##  copyright

atlassian does not allow copyright infringing activities on atlassian’s cloud
products or websites (our “ **services** ”). we will remove a party’s data or
content from our services if properly notified that such data or content
infringes on another's copyright rights. atlassian has a policy of
terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of parties who
repeatedly infringe copyright holders’ copyrights. you are a “repeat
infringer” if, on more than two occasions, you have been notified of
infringing activity or have had your data or content removed from our
services. atlassian also reserves the right to terminate your accounts
suspected of infringing copyrights upon the first incident without further
notice, at our sole discretion.

if you believe that any content in our services violates your copyright, you
should notify atlassian's copyright agent in writing pursuant to the digital
millennium copyright act (“ **dmca** ”), 17 u.s.c. § 512(c)(3). the contact
information for atlassian's copyright agent is at the bottom of this section.

in order for atlassian to take action, you must do the following in your
notice:

(1) provide your physical or electronic signature;

(2) identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed, or, if
multiple copyrighted works are covered by the notice, a representative list of
such works;

(3) identify the item that you think is infringing and which is to be removed
or access to which is to be disabled, and include sufficient information about
where the material is located (including which website) so that atlassian can
find it (such as the item’s url);

(4) provide atlassian with a way to contact you (such as address, telephone
number, or email);

(5) provide a statement that you believe in good faith that the item
identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent,
or the law to be used by atlassian; and

(6) provide a statement that the information you provide in your notice is

  * accurate, and that
  * under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner whose work is allegedly being infringed.

we will promptly notify the alleged infringer that you have claimed ownership
of the rights in this content and that we have complied with your takedown
notice for the content.

here is the contact information for atlassian's copyright agent:

atlassian pty ltd  
c/o atlassian, inc.  
350 bush street  
san francisco, ca 94104  
attn: copyright agent  
e-mail: [copyright@atlassian.com](mailto:copyright@atlassian.com)

## trademark

trademark owners should make an effort to directly contact an offending third
party before submitting a trademark infringement report to atlassian.

if you are a trademark owner and you believe in good faith that any content on
our services or infringes on your trademark rights, please inform us in
writing [trademarks@atlassian.com](mailto:trademarks@atlassian.com ) or at the
notice address for atlassian indicated in the agreement. your notice must
include:

(1) identification of the trademark(s) claimed to have been infringed, and, if
registered with the united states patent and trademark office or similar
foreign entity, the registration number of the mark(s);

(2) identification of the material claimed to be infringing and information
sufficient to permit atlassian to locate the material, such as the specific
url where the trademark appears on the services;

(3) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of
the trademark in the manner complained of is an infringement of the rights
granted under united states or foreign trademark law;

(4) a statement that the information in the letter is:

  * accurate, and
  * under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the allegedly infringed trademark; and

(5) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf
of the owner of the trademark that is allegedly infringed.

once you submit the report to atlassian, our team will begin a brief
investigation and will take action that it deems appropriate under the
circumstances. if more information is needed from you, we will reach out via
e-mail.

atlassian reserves the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or
individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames. accounts
using business names or logos to mislead others may be permanently suspended.

but please note that atlassian is not in a position to adjudicate complicated
trademark disputes between third parties. therefore, we are not in a position
to act on reports that require a complex legal analysis or factual
investigation. in those instances, we encourage you to contact the third party
directly to try and resolve the matter. in fact, you should consider doing so
even before filing a report with us, as it is often more effective in
resolving the dispute.

if we decide to take down content in response your report, please note that we
will provide your report and contact information to the affected party, who
may contact you directly regarding the matter.
