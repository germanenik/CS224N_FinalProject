> (including software) and other services included on or otherwise made
> available to you through the imdb services are provided by imdb on an "as
> is" and "as available" basis. imdb makes no representations or warranties of

**imdb software terms** in addition to these conditions of use, the terms
found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the
software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from
time to time for your use in connection with imdb services (“imdb software”).
if we provide specific terms for the imdb software and there is a conflict
between the specific terms for the imdb software and these conditions of use,
the specific terms for the imdb software will govern.

### applicable law

by using any imdb service, you agree that the laws of the state of washington,
without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these conditions
of use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and imdb.

### disputes

any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any imdb service, or
any products or services sold or distributed by imdb or through the imdb
services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except
that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. the
federal arbitration act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

**a.** there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
arbitration award is limited. however, an arbitrator can award on an
individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive
and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of
these conditions of use as a court would.  

**b.** to begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent corporation
service company, 300 deschutes way sw, suite 304, tumwater, wa 98051. the
arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association (aaa)
under its rules, including the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer-
related disputes. the aaa’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
1-800-778-7879. payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
be governed by the aaa’s rules. we will reimburse those fees for claims
totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
frivolous. likewise, imdb will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in
arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. you may
choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually
agreed location.  

**c.** you and imdb each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
representative action. if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
in arbitration you and imdb each waive any right to a jury trial. you and imdb
also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement
or other misuse of intellectual property rights.  

### site policies, modification, and severability

please review our other policies. these policies also govern your use of imdb
services. we reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and
these our site, policies, terms, and these conditions of use at any time. if
any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect
the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

    2. **use of third party services**. when you use the imdb software, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties, such as a wireless carrier or a mobile platform provider. your use of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties. 
    3. **no reverse engineering**. you may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with, the imdb software, whether in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or of the imdb software.

    5. **export regulations; government end users**. you must comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the department of commerce and other united states agencies and authorities that may apply to the imdb software. if you are a u.s. government end user, we are licensing the imdb software to you as a "commercial item" as that term is defined in the u.s. code of federal regulations (see 48 c.f.r. § 2.101), and the rights we grant you to the imdb software are the same as the rights we grant to all others under these conditions of use.
