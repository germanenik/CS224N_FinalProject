###  more

  * [ additional policies  ](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801981?hl=en&ref_topic=9282365)

## how do we develop new policies and update existing ones?

each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent,
well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world. theyâre
developed in partnership with a wide range of external industry and policy
experts, as well as youtube creators. new policies go through multiple rounds
of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers
can apply them accurately and consistently.

this work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to
understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the youtube
community protected and giving everyone a voice.

## how does youtube identify content that violates community guidelines?

with hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to youtube every minute, we use
a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at
scale. machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to
find content similar to other content weâve already removed, even before
itâs viewed.

we also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate
problems before they emerge. our intelligence desk monitors the news, social
media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate
content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before
they can become a larger issue.

## is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content?

though we are determined to continue reducing exposure to videos that violate
our policies and have tasked over 10,000 people with detecting, reviewing, and
removing content that violates our guidelines, the youtube community also
plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate.

  * if you see content that you think violates community guidelines, you can use [our flagging feature](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027) to submit content for review.

  * we developed the [youtube trusted flagger program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7554338?hl=en) to provide additional tools to non-governmental organizations (ngos) with expertise in a policy area, government agencies, and individuals with high flagging accuracy rates. participants receive training on youtube policies and have a direct path of communication with our trust & safety specialists. videos flagged by trusted flaggers are not automatically removed. they are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but review by our teams may be expedited.

## what action does youtube take for content that violates community
guidelines?

youtube takes action on flagged videos after review by our trained human
reviewers. they assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies,
and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or
artistic purpose. our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies
and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. our
automated flagging systems also help us identify and remove spam
automatically, as well as re-uploads of content weâve already reviewed and
determined violates our policies.

## community guidelines strikes

if our reviewers determine that content violates our community guidelines, we
remove the content and send a notice to the creator. the first time a creator
violates our community guidelines, the creator receives a warning with no
penalty to the channel. after one warning, weâll issue a community
guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary
restrictions. channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will
be terminated. channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that
have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes
system and be terminated. all strikes and terminations can be appealed if the
creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the
decision.

## age-restricting content

sometimes content doesn't violate our community guidelines, but may not be
appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. in these cases, our review team
will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to
viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who have
[restricted mode](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/174084) enabled.
creators can also choose to [age restrict their own
content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2950063?hl=en&ref_topic=9387083)
at upload if they think itâs not suitable for younger audiences.
