if, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11 (b) ), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the aaa rules . [CLS] [SEP] in such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules . [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75 , 000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the aaa rules . [CLS] [SEP] * * (5) alternative payment and attorney premium: * * if you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (2) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will: * pay you the amount of the award or $10 , 000 (" the alternative payment "), whichever is greater; and * pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (" the attorney premium "). [CLS] [SEP] if we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits . [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator' s ruling on the merits . [CLS] [SEP] in assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer . [CLS] [SEP] the right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law . [CLS] [SEP] thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount . [CLS] [SEP]
