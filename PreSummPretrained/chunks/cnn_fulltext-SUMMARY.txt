to the extent that a dispute is not subject to arbitration under section 12 (dispute resolution) of this agreement, that action shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in new york county, new york; and we both irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in new york county, new york for the adjudication of all non - arbitral claims .<q>the content, data, video, and all other material and features on the site are presented for the purpose of providing entertainment, news and / or information and / or promoting programs, films, music, games, and other products and / or services that are or may become available in the united states, its territories, possessions, and protectorates .<q>this is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein .
arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts .<q>unless expressly limited by this dispute resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award .<q>* * any arbitration under this agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted . * * [cls]  for any non - frivolous claim that does not exceed $75 , 000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration .
this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies .<q>such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf .<q>notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction .
* * (3) arbitration procedure: * * the arbitration will be governed by the consumer arbitration rules (" aaa rules ") of the american arbitration association (" aaa "), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the aaa .<q>all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide .<q>the arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers .
if, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11 (b) ), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the aaa rules .<q>* * (5) alternative payment and attorney premium: * * if you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (2) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will: * pay you the amount of the award or $10 , 000 (" the alternative payment "), whichever is greater; and * pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (" the attorney premium ").<q>thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount .
* * you and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding * * .<q>* * (6) requirement of individual arbitration: * * the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party' s individual claim .<q>however, you may not recover both the attorney premium and a duplicative award of attorneys' fees or costs .
the enforceable sections of these terms of use will remain binding upon the parties .<q>no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default .<q>
