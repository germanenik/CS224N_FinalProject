 **(6) requirement of individual arbitration:** the arbitrator may award
declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
party's individual claim.[CLS] [SEP] **you and we agree that each may bring claims
against the other only in your or our individual capacity, and not as a
plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative, or private
attorney general proceeding**.[CLS] [SEP] further, unless both you and we agree
otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims
and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or
private attorney general proceeding.[CLS] [SEP] if, after exhaustion of all appeals, any
of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief;
class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation
are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with
respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive
relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or request
for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief
shall be arbitrated.[CLS] [SEP]

**(7) future changes to arbitration provision:** notwithstanding any provision
in this agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change
to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice address), you
may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
change to the arbitration notice address provided above.[CLS] [SEP] by rejecting any
future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us
in accordance with the language of this provision.[CLS] [SEP]
