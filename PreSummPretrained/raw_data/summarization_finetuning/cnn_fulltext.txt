in part) worldwide in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter
developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such user
content, without payment to you or to any third parties. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the

of the service and/or site, these terms of use, or the relationship between
us, must be commenced within one year of the relevant events. [CLS] [SEP] a dispute is
commenced if it is filed in an arbitration or, if the dispute is non-
arbitrable, a court with jurisdiction, during the one-year period. [CLS] [SEP] if you or
we provide notice of a dispute under section 12 (dispute resolution), the one-
year period is tolled for 60 days following receipt of the notice of dispute. [CLS] [SEP]
you and we each waive—that is, give up—the right to pursue any dispute, claim
or controversy that is not filed within one year and any right you or we may
have had to pursue that dispute, claim or controversy in any forum is
permanently barred. [CLS] [SEP]

 **7\. indemnification.**[CLS] [SEP]

you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless cnn, its affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all
claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of the use of the
site by you or your account. [CLS] [SEP] cnn reserves the right to take over the exclusive
defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this
section. [CLS] [SEP] in such event, you shall provide cnn with such cooperation as is
reasonably requested by cnn. [CLS] [SEP]

 **8\. termination.**[CLS] [SEP]

cnn may terminate or suspend these terms of use at any time without notice to
you. [CLS] [SEP] without limiting the foregoing, cnn shall have the right to immediately
terminate your account in the event of any conduct by you which cnn, in its
sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach
by you of these terms of use. [CLS] [SEP] the provisions of sections 1 - 13 shall survive
termination of these terms of use. [CLS] [SEP]

 **9\. trademarks.**[CLS] [SEP]

cnn, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, own all rights to their logos
and trademarks used in connection with the site. [CLS] [SEP] all other logos and
trademarks appearing on the site are the property of their respective owners. [CLS] [SEP]

 **10\. governing law and venue.**[CLS] [SEP]

the content, data, video, and all other material and features on the site are
presented for the purpose of providing entertainment, news and/or information
and/or promoting programs, films, music, games, and other products and/or
services that are or may become available in the united states, its
territories, possessions, and protectorates. [CLS] [SEP]

any and all disputes, claims and controversies arising out of or in connection
with your access to, and/or use of the sites, and/or the provision of content,
services, and/or technology on or through the sites shall be governed by and
construed exclusively in accordance with the laws and decisions of the state
of new york applicable to contracts made, entered into and performed entirely
therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions, except to
the extent that law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law. [CLS] [SEP] to the
extent that a dispute is not subject to arbitration under section 12 (dispute
resolution) of this agreement, that action shall be brought in the appropriate
state or federal court located in new york county, new york; and we both
irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or
federal courts in new york county, new york for the adjudication of all non-
arbitral claims. [CLS] [SEP]

 **11\. severability.**[CLS] [SEP]

except as specified in section 12 (dispute resolution), if any provision of
this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then
that provision shall be deemed severable for this agreement and shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. [CLS] [SEP] this is
the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained
herein. [CLS] [SEP]

 **12\. dispute resolution.**[CLS] [SEP]

summary:

our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and
to the customer's satisfaction. [CLS] [SEP] please contact cnn at
[cnn.com/feedback](https://www.cnn.com/feedback). [CLS] [SEP] **in the unlikely event that
you're not satisfied with customer service's solution (or if cnn has not been
able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so
informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding
arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general
jurisdiction.**[CLS] [SEP]

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. [CLS] [SEP] arbitration uses a
neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited
discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. [CLS] [SEP]
unless expressly limited by this dispute resolution provision, arbitrators can
award the same damages and relief that a court can award. [CLS] [SEP] **any arbitration
under this agreement will take place on an individual basis; class
arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.**[CLS] [SEP] for any non-frivolous
claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration. [CLS] [SEP]
moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from us
to at least the same extent as you would be in court. [CLS] [SEP]

in addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you
more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if
any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you
an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute. [CLS] [SEP]

 **arbitration agreement**[CLS] [SEP]

 **(1) claims subject to arbitration:** cnn and you agree to arbitrate **all
disputes** **and claims** between us, except for claims arising from bodily
injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or
our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any
of our licensors, affiliates and partners). [CLS] [SEP] this agreement to arbitrate is
intended to be broadly interpreted. [CLS] [SEP] it includes, but is not limited to:

  * claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;
  * claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
  * claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;
  * claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
  * claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

references to "cnn," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries,
affiliates, agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content
as of the time your or our claim arises; our respective predecessors in
interest, successors, and assigns (including at&t and its affiliates); and all
authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or
prior agreements between us. [CLS] [SEP] notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may
bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so
long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a
court of general jurisdiction. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration agreement does not preclude
you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
agencies. [CLS] [SEP] such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your
behalf. [CLS] [SEP] **you agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and we are each
waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action**. [CLS] [SEP]
this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the
federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
provision. [CLS] [SEP] this arbitration provision shall survive termination of this
agreement. [CLS] [SEP]

**(2) pre-arbitration notice of disputes:** a party who intends to seek
arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of dispute
("notice"). [CLS] [SEP] the notice to cnn should be sent by certified mail to: general
counsel, warnermedia news & sports, 1 cnn center, atlanta, ga 30303 ("notice
address"). [CLS] [SEP] the notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("demand"). [CLS] [SEP]

if we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days
after the notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration
proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] during the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled. [CLS] [SEP] you may
download a form to initiate arbitration at:
adr.org/sites/default/files/consumer_demand_for_arbitration_form_1.pdf. [CLS] [SEP]

 **(3) arbitration procedure:** the arbitration will be governed by the
consumer arbitration rules ("aaa rules") of the american arbitration
association ("aaa"), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be
administered by the aaa. [CLS] [SEP] (if the aaa is unavailable, another arbitration
provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.)[CLS] [SEP] the aaa rules are
available online at www.adr.org, by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879, or by
requesting them in writing at the notice address. [CLS] [SEP] all issues are for the
arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and
enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must
be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may
consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving
different customers. [CLS] [SEP] unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. [CLS] [SEP] if
your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the
arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to
the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
established by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] if your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] regardless of the manner in which
the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
the award is based. [CLS] [SEP] except as provided in subsection (6) below, the arbitrator
can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award
under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP]

 **(4) arbitration fees** : after we receive notice at the notice address that
you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your
payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000 in
value. [CLS] [SEP] (the filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the
arbitration provider. [CLS] [SEP] if you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it
directly upon receiving a written request at the notice address.)[CLS] [SEP] we will pay
all aaa filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration
initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. [CLS] [SEP] if, however, the
arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b)), then the
payment of all such fees will be governed by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] in such case, you
agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise
your obligation to pay under the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP] in addition, if you initiate an
arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75,000 (either to
you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the aaa rules. [CLS] [SEP]

 **(5) alternative payment and attorney premium:** if you initiated
arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (2)
and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the
value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was
selected, then we will:

  * pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and 
  * pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium"). [CLS] [SEP]

if we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator
was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the
alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator
awards you any relief on the merits. [CLS] [SEP] the arbitrator may make rulings and
resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and
the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the
proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
arbitrator's ruling on the merits. [CLS] [SEP] in assessing whether an award that includes
attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written
settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award
representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing
the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer. [CLS] [SEP]

the right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys' fees and
expenses you may have under applicable law. [CLS] [SEP] thus, if you would be entitled to
a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the
arbitrator from awarding you that amount. [CLS] [SEP] however, you may not recover both
the attorney premium and a duplicative award of attorneys' fees or costs. [CLS] [SEP]
although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees
and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration, we agree that we will not seek
such an award. [CLS] [SEP]

 **(6) requirement of individual arbitration:** the arbitrator may award
declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
party's individual claim. [CLS] [SEP] **you and we agree that each may bring claims
against the other only in your or our individual capacity, and not as a
plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative, or private
attorney general proceeding**. [CLS] [SEP] further, unless both you and we agree
otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims
and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or
private attorney general proceeding. [CLS] [SEP] if, after exhaustion of all appeals, any
of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief;
class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation
are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with
respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive
relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or request
for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief
shall be arbitrated. [CLS] [SEP]

**(7) future changes to arbitration provision:** notwithstanding any provision
in this agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change
to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice address), you
may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
change to the arbitration notice address provided above. [CLS] [SEP] by rejecting any
future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us
in accordance with the language of this provision. [CLS] [SEP]

 **13\. miscellaneous.**[CLS] [SEP]

these terms of use and any operating rules for the site established by cnn
constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between
the parties with respect to such subject matter. [CLS] [SEP] the provisions of these terms
of use are for the benefit of cnn, its parent, subsidiaries, other affiliates
and its third party content providers and licensors and each shall have the
right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf. [CLS] [SEP] if

than the united states, you accept full responsibility for compliance with all
local laws. [CLS] [SEP] you are also subject to united states export controls and are
responsible for any violations of united states embargoes or other federal
rules and regulations restricting exports. [CLS] [SEP] no waiver by either party of any
breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or
subsequent breach or default. [CLS] [SEP] if any part of these terms of use is found by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be
replaced with language reflecting the original purpose in a valid and
enforceable manner. [CLS] [SEP] the enforceable sections of these terms of use will remain
binding upon the parties. [CLS] [SEP] the section headings used herein are for convenience
only and shall not be given any legal import. [CLS] [SEP]

neither cnn nor you shall be liable for damages or for delays or failures in
performance resulting from acts or occurrences beyond their reasonable
control, including, without limitation: fire, lightning, explosion, power
surge or failure, water, acts of god, war, terrorism, revolution, civil
commotion or acts of civil or military authorities or public enemies: any law,

including without limitation, strikes, slowdowns, picketing, or boycotts;
inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy
shortages, or acts or omissions of other common carriers. [CLS] [SEP]

cnn respects the rights of all copyright holders and in this regard, cnn has
adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the termination in
appropriate circumstances of users and account holders who infringe the rights
of copyright holders. [CLS] [SEP] if you believe that your work has been copied in a way
